\section{Directory overview}
\subsection{Environment variables}
DIRS is a list of directories with the suffix {\bf dir}.

There is a partial order of the directories which is not apparent.

The bootdir must occur first as it builds the boot language
compiler and the bootsys image.

The interpdir must come second because it builds the interpreter
and the interpsys image, which is the basic algebra engine.

The sharedir must occur before the algebradir because it
needs to put the databases in the proper location.

The algebradir comes next. It contains the source code for all
of the algebra that Axiom knows.

The etcdir must occur after the algebradir because it
builds the databases from all of the *.nrlib directories
constructed by algebradir.

The inputdir needs to occur last because it tests
various other parts of the system. 

The SRCDIRS variable is a list of directory targets. 
Since this varies from system to system it has been lifted
up to the top level Makefile.pamphlet. If you add a new
stanza to this Makefile you should check that list. 
\begin{chunk}{environment}
DIRS=${SRCDIRS}
VOL11=${BOOKS}/bookvol11.pamphlet

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The sman directory}
Superman (sman) is the master process that runs all of the other
processes including axiom, clef, nagman, graphics, and hyperdoc
\begin{chunk}{smandir}
smandir: ${SPD}/books/bookvol6.pamphlet
	@echo 5 making ${SRC}/sman
	@( cd sman ; \
	   ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol6.pamphlet >Makefile ; \
           ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The share directory}
The {\bf share} directory files that are shared by all version of the
system.

\begin{chunk}{sharedir}
sharedir: ${SRC}/share/Makefile
	@echo 9 making ${SRC}/share
	@(cd share ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

${SRC}/share/Makefile: ${SRC}/share/Makefile.pamphlet
	@echo 10 making ${SRC}/share/Makefile from \
           ${SRC}/share/Makefile.pamphlet
	@( cd share ; \
           ${EXTRACT} Makefile ; \
           cp Makefile.pdf ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/share.Makefile.pdf )

sharedocument: ${SRC}/share/Makefile
	@echo 11 documenting ${SRC}/share
	@( cd share ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} document )

shareclean: ${SRC}/share/Makefile
	@echo 12 cleaning ${SRC}/share
	@( cd share ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )
	@rm -f ${SRC}/share/Makefile
	@rm -f ${SRC}/share/Makefile.dvi

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The boot directory}
Axiom is built in layers. The first layer is contructed into
an image called {\bf bootsys}. The {\bf bootsys} image is used
to translate boot code to common lisp code. Since a boot coded
interpreter is needed to translate the code for the boot coded
interpreter we have a "boot-strapping" problem. In order to get
the whole process to start we need certain files kept in 
common lisp form. This directory contains those files.

\begin{chunk}{bootdir}
bootdir: ${SRC}/boot/Makefile
	@echo 21 making ${SRC}/boot
	@(cd boot ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

${SRC}/boot/Makefile: ${SRC}/boot/Makefile.pamphlet
	@echo 22 making ${SRC}/boot/Makefile from ${SRC}/boot/Makefile.pamphlet
	@( cd boot ; \
           ${EXTRACT} Makefile ; \
           cp Makefile.pdf ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/boot.Makefile.pdf )

bootdocument: ${SRC}/boot/Makefile
	@echo 23 documenting ${SRC}/boot
	@( cd boot ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} document )

bootclean: ${SRC}/boot/Makefile
	@echo 24 cleaning ${SRC}/boot
	@( cd boot ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )
	@rm -rf ${OBJ}/${SYS}/boot
	@rm -f ${SRC}/boot/Makefile
	@rm -f ${SRC}/boot/Makefile.dvi

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The interp directory}
Once {\bf bootsys} exists we need to build {\bf depsys}
and {\bf interpsys}. Since these two images share a lot of
files they are built in the interp subdirectory using the
same Makefile.

Book Volume 5 contains the interpreter.

Book Volume 9 contains the compiler.

We need the file util.ht from the hyperdoc pages (bookvol7.1)
because the spad compiler checks the syntax of the ++ comments
against the macros that exist in that file. This is done in the
function buildHtMacroTable (htcheck.boot)

\begin{chunk}{interpdir}
interpdir: ${SRC}/interp/Makefile
	@echo 25 making ${SRC}/interp
	@cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol5.pamphlet interp
	@cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol9.pamphlet interp
	@cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol10.5.pamphlet interp
	@(cd ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc ; \
          ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol7.1.pamphlet util.ht >util.ht )
	@(cd interp ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

${SRC}/interp/Makefile: ${SRC}/interp/Makefile.pamphlet
	@echo 26 making ${SRC}/interp/Makefile from \
                 ${SRC}/interp/Makefile.pamphlet
	@( cd interp ; \
           ${EXTRACT} Makefile ; \
           cp Makefile.pdf ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/interp.Makefile.pdf )

interpdocument: ${SRC}/interp/Makefile
	@echo 27 documenting ${SRC}/interp
	@( cd interp ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} document )

interpclean: ${SRC}/interp/Makefile
	@echo 28 cleaning ${SRC}/interp
	@( cd interp ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )
	@rm -rf ${OBJ}/${SYS}/interp
	@rm -f ${SRC}/interp/Makefile
	@rm -f ${SRC}/interp/Makefile.dvi

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The input directory}
The input directory contains code used for examples, regression
testing, and bug tracking. In a shipped system the working examples
are collected and documented so a user can learn how to use Axiom's
many domains and packages.

During development the input files can be used for tracking bugs
and testing fixes of known bugs. Once a bug is fixed it is moved
to the regression test set.

Prior to building a shippable system all of the input files are
run with the example code and the regression test code. Regression
test input files are compared against known good results to ensure
that nothing has been broken in the process of fixing bugs.

\begin{chunk}{inputdir}
inputdir: ${SRC}/input/Makefile
	@echo 33 making ${SRC}/input
	@(cd input ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} )
#	@(cd input ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} -j 10)

${SRC}/input/Makefile: ${SRC}/input/Makefile.pamphlet
	@echo 34 making ${SRC}/input/Makefile from \
                ${SRC}/input/Makefile.pamphlet
	@( cd input ; \
           ${EXTRACT} Makefile ; \
           cp Makefile.pdf ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/input.Makefile.pdf )

inputdocument: ${SRC}/input/Makefile
	@echo 35 documenting ${SRC}/input
	@( cd input ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} document )

inputclean: ${SRC}/input/Makefile
	@echo 36 cleaning ${SRC}/input
	@( cd input ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )
	@rm -rf ${OBJ}/${SYS}/input
	@rm -f ${SRC}/input/Makefile
	@rm -f ${SRC}/input/Makefile.dvi

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The etc directory}
The etc directory contains code used as tools surrounding Axiom.

The asq \cite{2} command, contained in this directory, is useful
for finding detailed information about domains, packages, and
categories from the shell without running Axiom.
\begin{chunk}{etcdir}
etcdir: ${SRC}/etc/Makefile
	@echo 37 making ${SRC}/etc
	@(cd etc ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

${SRC}/etc/Makefile: ${SRC}/etc/Makefile.pamphlet
	@echo 38 making ${SRC}/etc/Makefile from ${SRC}/etc/Makefile.pamphlet
	@( cd etc ; \
           ${EXTRACT} Makefile ; \
           cp Makefile.pdf ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/etc.Makefile.pdf )

etcdocument: ${SRC}/etc/Makefile
	@echo 39 documenting ${SRC}/etc
	@( cd etc ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} document )

etcclean: ${SRC}/etc/Makefile
	@echo 40 cleaning ${SRC}/etc
	@( cd etc ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )
	@rm -rf ${OBJ}/${SYS}/etc
	@rm -f ${SRC}/etc/Makefile
	@rm -f ${SRC}/etc/Makefile.dvi

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The doc directory}
The doc directory contains code used for documenting Axiom.

We've added the books directory above as part of the literate process.
This takes all of the Axiom volumes and creates .pdf copies in the
final doc directory.

\begin{chunk}{docdir}
docdir: 
	@echo 41 making ${SRC}/doc
	@(cd ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/hypertex ; \
	 ${BOOKS}/tanglec axiom1.bitmap >bitmaps/axiom1.bitmap ; \
	 ${BOOKS}/tanglec rcm3720.input >rcm3720.input ; \
	 ${BOOKS}/tanglec strang.input >strang.input ; \
	 ${BOOKS}/tanglec signatures.txt >signatures.txt ; \
	 cp ${BOOKS}/ps/doctitle.png ${AXIOM}/doc/hypertex/doctitle.png ; \
	 cp ${BOOKS}/ps/lightbayou.png ${AXIOM}/doc/hypertex/lightbayou.png ) 
	@(cd ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/hypertex ; \
	  ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol11.pamphlet >Makefile11 ; \
	  ${ENV} ${MAKE} -f Makefile11 ; \
	  rm -f Makefile11 )

\end{chunk}
\subsection{Volume 7:Axiom Hyperdoc book}
Hyperdoc is the Axiom document browser.
\begin{chunk}{hyperdir}
hyperdir: ${SPD}/books/bookvol7.pamphlet ${SPD}/books/bookvol7.1.pamphlet
	@echo 7 making hyperdoc from bookvol7
	@(cd ${INT}/hyper ; \
          ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol7.pamphlet >Makefile ; \
	  ${ENV} ${MAKE} )
	@echo 7.1 making pages from bookvol7.1 ${ENV}
	@(cd ${INT}/hyper ; \
          ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol7.1.pamphlet >Makefile ; \
	  ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

\end{chunk}
\subsection{Volume 8: Axiom Graphics book}
\begin{chunk}{graphdir}
graphdir: ${SPD}/books/bookvol8.pamphlet
	@echo 8 making graph from bookvol8
	@(cd ${OBJ}/${SYS}/graph ; \
          ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol8.pamphlet Makefile >Makefile ; \
	  ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

\end{chunk}
\subsection{The algebra directory}
The algebra directory contains code written in Axiom's computer
algebra language called {\bf spad}. There are two compilers for
this language, the spad compiler and the {\bf Aldor}\cite{1} compiler.

Both of these compilers accept the same input language except for
some platform-dependent differences. The spad compiler is written
in Common Lisp (well, in boot, anyway) and is built into the 
interpreter. The Aldor compiler is written in C and runs
stand-alone. Both compile files that will run in Axiom's 
interpreter. Files which end in ``.spad'' use the internal 
spad compiler. Files which end in ``.as'' use the external
Aldor compiler.
\subsubsection{Making the Makefile}
The main body of the algebra Makefile is extracted from the
Makefile.pamphlet file as usual. It contains generic rules for
making all the .spad files in a series of ``layers'' such that
each layer depends on only those layers that preceed it, beginning
with the bootstap layer. Because the individual .spad files are
grouped into higher-level algebra pamphlet files, the rules for
extracting them are derived from a simple script findAlgebraFiles which
appends these additional rules to the Makefile.

The src/algebra/Makefile is specially constructed in two
steps. The first step uses the tangle command to extract
the normal Makefile information.

The second step is to extend the src/algebra/Makefile with
stanzas that describe the steps to extract the algebra from the
src/algebra/*.pamphlet files into the int/algebra/*.spad files.
Further details are provided in Makefile for src/algebra.

The doc/spadhelp directory contains flat files of help text
for the help system command. Algebra pamphlet contain examples
that can be shown from these commands.

We need to make the int/input file here because the algebra Makefile
will extract input files for regression testing from the algebra pamphlets.

We copy bookvol10.1 (Categories), bookvol10.2 (Domains), 
and bookvol10.3 (Packages) to the src/algebra subdirectory. 

\subsection{Volume 10: Axiom Algebra book}
\begin{chunk}{algebradir}
algebradir: ${SRC}/algebra/Makefile ${SPD}/books/bookvol10.pamphlet \
            ${SPD}/books/bookvol7.1.pamphlet
	@echo 29 making ${SRC}/algebra
	@(cd algebra ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} )

${SRC}/algebra/Makefile: ${BOOKS}/bookvol10.pamphlet
	@echo 30 making ${SRC}/algebra/Makefile from \
                ${BOOKS}/bookvol10.pamphlet
	@( cd algebra ; \
	${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol10.pamphlet Makefile >Makefile ; \
	cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol10.2.pamphlet . ; \
	cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol10.3.pamphlet . ; \
	cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol10.4.pamphlet . ; \
	cp ${SPD}/books/bookvol10.5.pamphlet . ; \
	echo 30a tangling findAlgebraFiles from \
                 ${BOOKS}/bookvol10.pamphlet ; \
	${BOOKS}/tanglec ${BOOKS}/bookvol10.pamphlet \
             findAlgebraFiles >${INT}/algebra/findAlgebraFiles ; \
	echo 30b running ${INT}/algebra/findAlgebraFiles ; \
	. ${INT}/algebra/findAlgebraFiles >> Makefile )

algebraclean: ${SRC}/algebra/Makefile
	@echo 32 cleaning ${SRC}/algebra
	@( cd algebra ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )
	@rm -rf ${OBJ}/${SYS}/algebra
	@rm -f ${SRC}/algebra/axiom.sty
	@rm -f ${SRC}/algebra/*.spad
	@rm -f ${SRC}/algebra/bookvol*
	@rm -f ${SRC}/algebra/Makefile
	@rm -f ${SRC}/algebra/Makefile.dvi

\end{chunk}
\subsection{Volume 11: Axiom Browser book}
These are the pages for the Axiom Firefox browser interface.
They can be expanded in parallel since they (currently) need no
post processing. Thus the "-j 10" argument to make. We use 
``Makefile11'' so that future parallel builds don't step on each other.
\begin{chunk}{browserdir}
browserdir: ${SPD}/books/bookvol11.pamphlet
	@echo 11 making browser from bookvol11
#	@(cd ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/hypertex ; \
#	  ${BOOKS}/tanglec ${SPD}/books/bookvol11.pamphlet >Makefile11 ; \
#	  ${ENV} ${MAKE} -j 10 -f Makefile11 ; \
#	  rm -f Makefile11 )

\end{chunk}
