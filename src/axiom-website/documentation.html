<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b><p>
I come from a mathematics department and many mathematicians,
particularly those in pure math, have a strong distrust of computers
They are really not inclined to accept computer-based proofs,
although there have been some dramatic examples of those in the last
two or three decades.
</p><p>
In the early 1970s, researchers at IBM developed a symbolic algebra
system called Scratchpad. This went on inside IBM for many years.
There were lots of papers written about it. It ultimately got renamed
to Axiom and was sold by NAG, the Numerical Algorithms Group in
England, for a few years.  Then it disappeared from the market and
became unavailable.
</p><p>
People worried about this for probably about 5 years but finally NAG
was able to release it. A major decision has been taken. Axiom is
being completely reimplemented as a literate program. The reason
is that software outlives hardware, and often its own authors. The
author of Scratchpad died about 5 years ago.
</p><p>
So they feel the only way that this system can survive and be used by
future generations is to be written as a literate program so that the
reason behind the program is embedded there as part of the description
of the code. I think this is really important and could be really
quite significant for the future growth of computing and mathematics.

NO! Most programmers, most of the time, scream in horror when
they have to do something extra for reliability, dependability,
maintainability, all the good stuff. And most programmers don't
actually care. They just ship when they are told to ship. I wish
we were in a field with general professionalsim but I don't see
much sign of it. This is not good.

The nature of functional programming is to build, Russian doll-style,

something like a literate style, your efforts are quickly lost in the

you've simply dug a nice, deep tunnel that is, at the same time,
collapsing behind you. YOU may know what you've done, but how to make
others aware and get them involved? All they see is some collapsed
tunnel with a sales pitch about how you should go re-dig that very same
tunnel.

In my life as an artchitect, I find that the single thing which inhibits

good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, "Of
course not, that isn't what I am trying to do...I could never do that."

Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must be

worthwhile."

<blockquote>
<b><p>
The effect of this simple shift of emphasis can be so profound as to change
one's whole approach to programming. Under the literate programming paradigm,
the central activity of programming becomes that of conveying meaning to 
other intelligent beings rather than merely convincing the computer to behave
in a particular way. It is the difference between performing and exposing
a magic trick.

<blockquote>
<b><p>
The index to Digital Typography lists eleven pages where the importance
of stability is stressed, and I urge all maintainers of Tex and Metafont
to read them again every few years. Any object of nontrivial complexity
is non-optimum, in the sense that it can be improved in some way (while
still remaining non-optimum); therefore there's always a reason to change 
anything that isn't trivial. But one of Tex's principal advantages is
the fact that  it does not change -- except for serious flaws whose
correction is unlikely to affect more than a very tiny number of
archival documents.

Once upon a time I took great care to ensure that TeX82 would be
truly archival so that results obtainable today would produce the same
output 50 years from now but that was manifestly foolish. Let's face
it, who is going to care one whit for what I do today after even 5
years have elapsed, let alone 50. Life is too short to re-read
anything anymore in the internet age. Nothing over 30 months old is

From a November, 2011 Knuth interview:

<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b><p>
Yet to me, literate programming is certainly the most important thing
that came out of the TeX project. Not only has it enabled me to write
and maintain programs faster and more reliably than ever before, and
been one of my greatest sources of joy since the 1980s -- it has
actually been indispensable at times. Some of my major programs, such
as the MMIX meta-simulator, could not have been written with any other
methodology that I've ever heard of. The complexity was simply too
daunting for my limited brain to handle; without literate programming,
the whole enterprise would have flopped miserably.
</p>
<p>
If people discover nice ways to use the newfangled multithreaded
machines, I would expect the discovery to come from people who
routinely use literate programming. Literate programming is what you
need to rise above the ordinary level of achievement. But I don't
believe in forcing ideas on anybody.

Interview with Donald Knuth</a>

<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b><p>
An abbot of the Seven-Clawed Blind Eagle Clan was tallying the
deliverables of the temple monks, when he noticed that a monk of the
Laughing Monkey Clan had produced no design documents.
</p>
<p>
"What if a problem were discovered in our production system?" the abbot
asked the monk. "How would the cause be understood by any besides
yourself?"
</p>
<p>
"The code itself should be examined," said the monk. "The Document is a
sickly beast, easily subject to the Three Plagues of Error: omission,
obfuscation, and obsolescence."
</p>
<p>
The abbot reported this to the Java master, who said: "Have the monk
balance on one foot with his staff outstretched, every day from dusk to
midnight. If he can say a word to please me I will revoke the punishment,
but not otherwise."
</p>
<p>
"Is there such a word?" asked the abbot.
</p>
<p>
"It is difficult to be certain," reflected the master. "Yesterday I was 
pleased by the sound of a cricket chirping after the first three drops
of rain. The day before, the plashing of milk in a pail returned me to
a pleasant memory of my youth. Perhaps the answer lies in the fragrance
of a white lotus that drifted once in a pond below my window."

What do you do with undocumented legacy code? I have A LOT of this

webapps and services that are completely undocumented. No javadocs,
no comments in the source code, no flow diagrams, no written explanations,
nothing. Some of these libraries don't even have source code attached to
them, and of course there are no information about them whatsoever on the
internet, so they must have been developed internally, or even worse,
borrowed from mysterious sources. Needless to say that the original devs are
long disappeared, even before I joined the team.

<blockquote>
<b><p>
Donald Knuth, like a genius, shattered my illusions. He is so confident
in his code, that he pays bug bounties from his own pocket; for any
kind of bug. Knuth doesn't write code in small pieces. He goes six months
or so without testing his code, then he tests it all at once. When he tests,
he says, "I get into the meanest, nastiest frame of mind that I can manage,
and I write the cruelest test code I can think of; then I turn around and
embed that in even nastier constructions that are almost obscene." At
that point, he tries to test everything. Still, the question is raised,
how does Knuth keep things straight without testing for so long?
<br/><br/>
Knuth invented literate programming to keep his thoughts clear. He intertwines
the documentation with the code, like a story. Literate programming lets him
structure the code in a way that is easiest to read. He says, "The extra time
I spend in preparing additional commentary is regained because the debugging
time is reduced."

Comments as oral tradition

The best comments seem to have an aspect of oral tradition to them;
they not only explain what is going on but provide a narative as to why.

Comments live with the code but do not otherwise affect its correctness --
allowing for broad scope and artistic license.

Relevant, correct software systems will survive long past their creators;
comments are the art within the timeless machine.

Comments are how we speak to future generations

<br/>
Once a program has been developed and the developers have moved
on to other tasks it needs to be maintained. The fundamental problem
is that if you modify code you didn't write, you don't see the big
picture and you don't understand the reasons why the code is written
the way it is. Thus changing code without a larger context is almost
always going to introduce new bugs.
</p>
<p>
The only way to correctly change code is to deeply understand the
implications of the change. This requires a deep understanding of
the code and an awareness of the big picture. Yet the "why" of code
is rarely ever written down in standard programming practice.
The goal is only to elaborate the "how" so the machine can perform
the task. The programmer communicates with the machine.
</p>
<p>
Literate programming, as used in Axiom, is an attempt to communicate
with other users, developers, and researchers in addition to the
machine. The goal is to have the program read like a story so that
others can understand the rational, the theory, the choices, the
implications, and the implementation context as well as the "how".
</p>
<p>
This code is intended to live forever but it is highly probable
that you will not. Write to communicate with the next person to
pick up the torch. When you explore code, write down what you learn.
When you change code, explain why you made your choices. When you 
write new code explain what others need to know to maintain it.

  <p>
  Axiom is being reworked to use the Firefox browser as the new
  front end. <a href="hyperdoc/rootpage.xhtml">Static pages</a>
  from the new hyperdoc show some of the details. These pages 
  will be "live" in the new Axiom hyperdoc.

  <a name="buildorder"/>
  The <a href="hp.svg">Axiom build graph</a> shows the algebra
  hierarchy in required build order. Note that the edges in the
  graph only show dependence on the prior level in the hierarchy.
  There are approximate 1100 total nodes. Each node represents a
  single domain, category, or package. Graph nodes that are elliptical
  show objects that get build as part of the bootstrap process. 

  <p>
  The <a href="dotabb.html">algebra graph</a> in its current form is 
  available. You'll need a reasonably new browser to see the graph.
  This is a work in progress.

   The <a href="rosetta.html">Rosetta</a> 
   <a href="rosetta.tex">(src)</a> 
   <a href="rosetta.pdf">(pdf)</a> 
   document is a comparison of nearly equivalent commands between 
   many different computer algebra systems.
