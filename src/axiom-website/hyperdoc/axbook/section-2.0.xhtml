<p>Only recently have I begun to realize that the problem is not merely
one of technical mastery or the competent application of the rules 
...
but that there is actually something else which is guiding these
rules. It actually involves a different level of mastery. It's quite
a different process to do it right; and every single act that you 
do can be done in that sense well or badly. But even assuming that 
you have got the technical part clear, the creation of this quality
is a much more complicated process of the most utterly absorbing and
fascinating dimensions. It is in fact a major creative or artistic 
act -- every single little thing you do -- ...

<p>In this chapter we look at the key notion of <span class="italic">type</span> and its
generalization <span class="italic">mode</span>.  We show that every Axiom object has a type
that determines what you can do with the object.  In particular, we
explain how to use types to call specific functions from particular
parts of the library and how types and modes can be used to create new
objects from old.  We also look at <span class="teletype">Record</span> and <span class="teletype">Union</span> types
and the special type <span class="teletype">Any</span>.  Finally, we give you an idea of how
Axiom manipulates types and modes internally to resolve ambiguities.
