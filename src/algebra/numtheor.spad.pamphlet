\subsection{The inverse function}
The inverse function is derived from the 
{\bf Extended Euclidean Algorithm}.
If we divide one integer by another nonzero integer we get an integer
quotient plus a remainder which is, in general, a rational number. 
For instance, 
\[13/5 = 2 + 3/5\]
where 2 is the quotient and $3/5$ is the remainder.

If we multiply thru by the denominator of the remainder we get an answer
in integer terms which no longer involves division:
\[13 = 2(5) + 3\]

This gives a method of dividing integers. Specifically, if a and b are
positive integers, there exist unique non-negative integers q
and r so that
\[a = qb + r , {\rm\ where\ } 0 \le r < b\]
q is called the quotient and r the remainder.

The greatest common divisor of integers a and b, denoted by gcd(a,b),
is the largest integer that divides (without remainder) both a and
b. So, for example: gcd(15, 5) = 5, gcd(7, 9) = 1, gcd(12, 9) = 3,
gcd(81, 57) = 3.

The gcd of two integers can be found by repeated application of the
division algorithm, this is known as the Euclidean Algorithm. You
repeatedly divide the divisor by the remainder until the remainder is
0. The gcd is the last non-zero remainder in this algorithm. The
following example shows the algorithm.

Finding the gcd of 81 and 57 by the {\bf Euclidean Algorithm}:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
81 & = & 1(57) + 24\\
57 & = & 2(24) + 9\\
24 & = & 2(9) + 6\\
9 & = & 1(6) + 3\\
6 & = & 2(3) + 0
\end{array}
\]

So the greatest commmon divisor, the GCD(81,51)=3.

If the gcd(a, b) = r then there exist integers s and t so that
\[s(a) + t(b) = r\]

By back substitution in the steps in the Euclidean Algorithm, it is
possible to find these integers s and t. We shall do this with the
above example:

Starting with the next to last line, we have:
\[3 = 9 -1(6)\]
From the line before that, we see that $6 = 24 - 2(9)$, so:
\[3 = 9 - 1(24 - 2(9)) = 3(9) - 1(24)\]
From the line before that, we have $9 = 57 - 2(24)$, so:
\[3 = 3( 57 - 2(24)) - 1(24) = 3(57) - 7(24)\]
And, from the line before that $24 = 81 - 1(57)$, giving us:
\[3 = 3(57) - 7( 81 - 1(57)) = 10(57) -7(81)\]
So we have found s = -7 and t = 10.

The {\bf Extended Euclidean Algorithm} computes the GCD($a$,$b$) and 
the values for $s$ and $t$.

Suppose we were doing arithmetics modulo 26 and we needed to find the
inverse of a number mod 26. This turned out to be a difficult task
(and not always possible). We observed that a number $x$ had an inverse
mod 26 (i.e., a number $y$ so that $xy = 1 {\rm\ mod\ } 26$) 
if and only if $gcd(x,26) = 1$. 
In the general case the inverse
of $x$ exists if and only if $gcd(x, n) = 1$ and if it exists then
there exist integers $s$ and $t$ so that

\[sx + tn = 1\]

But this says that $sx = 1 + (-t)n$, or in other words, 
\[sx \equiv 1 {\rm\ mod\ } n\]  
So, s (reduced mod n if need be) is the inverse of $x {\rm\ mod\ }n$. 
The extended Euclidean algorithm calculates $s$ efficiently.

\subsubsection{Finding the inverse mod n}

We will number the steps of the Euclidean algorithm starting
with step 0. The quotient obtained at step $i$ will be denoted by $q_i$ 
and an auxillary number, $s_i$. For the first two steps, the value
of this number is given: $s_0 = 0$ and $s_1 = 1$. For the remainder of the
steps, we recursively calculate 
\[s_i = s_{i-2} - s_{i-1} q_{i-2} {\rm\ (mod\ n)}\] 

The algorithm starts by "dividing" $n$ by $x$. 
If the last non-zero remainder occurs at step $k$, 
then if this remainder is 1, $x$ has an inverse and it is $s_{k+2}$. 
If the remainder is not 1, then $x$ does not have an inverse. 

Find the inverse of 15 mod 26.
\[
\begin{array}{crcll}
Step 0: &26 &=& 1(15) + 11 &s_0 = 0\\
Step 1: &15 &=& 1(11) + 4  &s_1 = 1\\
Step 2: &11 &=& 2(4) + 3   
&s_2 = 0 - 1( 1) {\rm\ mod\ } 26 = 25\\
Step 3: &4  &=& 1(3) + 1   
&s_3 = 1 - 25( 1) {\rm\ mod\ } 26 = -24 {\rm\ mod\ } 26 = 2\\
Step 4: &3  &=& 3(1) + 0   
&s_4 = 25 - 2( 2) {\rm\ mod\ } 26 = 21\\
&&& &s_5 = 2 - 21( 1) {\rm\ mod\ } 26 = -19 {\rm\ mod\ } 26 = 7
\end{array}
\]
Notice that $15(7) = 105 = 1 + 4(26) \equiv 1 ({\rm\ mod\ } 26)$. 

Using the half extended Euclidean algorithm we compute 1/a mod b.

\subsection{The Chinese Remainder Algorithm}
\subsubsection{Chinese Remainder Theorem}
Let $m_1$,$m_2$,\ldots,$m_r$ be positive integers that are pairwise
relatively prime. Let $x_1$,$x_2$,\ldots,$x_r$ be integers with 
$0 \le x_i < m_i$. Then, there is exactly one $x$ in the interval
\[0 \le x < m_1 \cdot m_2 \cdots m_r\]
that satisfies the remainder equations
\[{\rm\ irem\ }(x,m_i) = x_i,\ \ \ i=1,2,\ldots,r\]
where {\bf irem} is the positive integer remainder function.
\subsubsection{Chinese Remainder Example}
Let $x_1 = 4$, $m_1 = 5$, $x_2 = 2$, $m_2 = 3$. We know that 
\[{\rm\ irem\ }(x,m_1) = x_1\]
\[{\rm\ irem\ }(x,m_2) = x_2\]
where $0 \le x_1 < m_1$ and $0 \le x_2 < m_2$. By the extended
Euclidean Algorithm there are integers $c$ and $d$ such that
\[c m_1 + d m_2 = 1\].
\noindent
In this case we are looking for an integer such that
\[{\rm\ irem\ }(x,5) = 4\]
\[{\rm\ irem\ }(x,3) = 2\]

The algorithm we use is to first 
compute the positive integer
remainder of $x_1$ and $m_1$ to get a new $x_1$:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
x_1 & = & {\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }(x_1,m_1)\\
4 & = & {\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }(4,5)
\end{array}
\]
Next compute the positive integer
remainder of $x_2$ and $m_2$ to get a new $x_2$:
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
x_2 & = & {\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }(x_2,m_2)\\
2 & = & {\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }(2,3)
\end{array}
\]
Then we compute
\[x_1 + m_1 \cdot {\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }
(((x_2-x_1)\cdot{\rm inverse}(m_1,m_2)),m_2)\]
or
\[4+5*{\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }(((2-4)*{\rm\ inverse\ }(5,3)),3)\]
or
\[4+5*{\rm\ positiveRemainder\ }(-2*2),3)\]
or
\[4+5*2\]
or
\[14\]
<<chineseRemainder(x1,m1,x2,m2)>>=
  chineseRemainder(x1,m1,x2,m2) ==
    m1 < 0 or m2 < 0 => error "moduli must be positive"
    x1 := positiveRemainder(x1,m1)
    x2 := positiveRemainder(x2,m2)
    x1 + m1 * positiveRemainder(((x2-x1) * inverse(m1,m2)),m2)

@
This function has a restricted signature which only allows for
computing the chinese remainder of two numbers and two moduli.

    ++ \spad{chineseRemainder(x1,m1,x2,m2)} returns w, where w is such that
    ++ \spad{w = x1 mod m1} and \spad{w = x2 mod m2}. Note: \spad{m1} and
    ++ \spad{m2} must be relatively prime.
@
We test the particular example. The result should be 14.
