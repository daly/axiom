++ Date Last Updated: 12 April 1991

++ AMS Classifications:
++ Keywords: complex zeros, roots

++  complexity, preliminary report, Univ. Tuebingen, 1982
++ Description:
++  \spadtype{ComplexRootFindingPackage} provides functions to
++  find all roots of a polynomial p over the complex number by
++  using Plesken's idea to calculate in the polynomial ring
++  modulo f and employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
++  In this first version, the precision (see \spadfunFrom{digits}{Float})
++  is not increased when this is necessary to
++  avoid rounding errors. Hence it is the user's responsibility to
++  increase the precision if necessary.
++  Note also, if this package is called with e.g. \spadtype{Fraction Integer},
++  the precise calculations could require a lot of time.
++  Also note that evaluating the zeros is not necessarily a good check
++  whether the result is correct: already evaluation can cause
++  rounding errors.

       ++ reciprocalPolynomial(p) calulates a polynomial which has exactly
       ++ the inverses of the non-zero roots of p as roots, and the same
       ++ number of 0-roots.
     rootRadius: (UP,R) -> R

     schwerpunkt: UP ->  C
       ++ schwerpunkt(p) determines the 'Schwerpunkt' of the roots of the
       ++ polynomial p of degree n, i.e. the center of gravity, which is
       ++ {\em coeffient of \spad{x**(n-1)}} divided by
       ++ {\em n times coefficient of \spad{x**n}}.
     setErrorBound : R -> R
       ++ setErrorBound(eps) changes the internal error bound,
       -- by default being {\em 10 ** (-20)} to eps, if R is
       ++ by default being {\em 10 ** (-3)} to eps, if R is
       ++ a member in the category \spadtype{QuotientFieldCategory Integer}.
       ++ The internal {\em globalDigits} is set to
       -- {\em ceiling(1/r)**2*10} being {\em 10**41} by default.
       ++ {\em ceiling(1/r)**2*10} being {\em 10**7} by default.
     startPolynomial: UP  -> Record(start: UP, factors: FR UP)
       ++ startPolynomial(p) uses the ideas of Schoenhage's
       ++ variant of Graeffe's method to construct circles which separate
       ++ roots to get a good start polynomial, i.e. one whose
       ++ image under the Chinese Remainder Isomorphism has both entries
       ++ of norm smaller and greater or equal to 1. In case the
       ++ roots are found during internal calculations.
       ++ The corresponding factors
       ++ are in {\em factors} which are otherwise 1.
