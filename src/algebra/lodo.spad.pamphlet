++ Author: Manuel Bronstein

++ Date Last Updated: 15 April 1994
++ Description:
++   \spad{LinearOrdinaryDifferentialOperatorsOps} provides symmetric
++   products and sums for linear ordinary differential operators.
-- Putting those operations here rather than defaults in LODOCAT allows
-- LODOCAT to be defined independently of the derivative used.
