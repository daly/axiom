++  GrayCode provides a function for efficiently running
++  through all subsets of a finite set, only changing one element
++  by another one.

      ++ nextSubsetGray(ww,n) returns a vector {\em vv} whose components
      ++ have the following meanings:\begin{items}
      ++ \item {\em vv.1}: a vector of length n whose entries are 0 or 1. This
      ++    can be interpreted as a code for a subset of the set 1,...,n;
      ++    {\em vv.1} differs from {\em ww.1} by exactly one entry;
      ++ \item {\em vv.2.1} is the number of the entry of {\em vv.1} which
      ++    will be changed next time;
      ++ \item {\em vv.2.1 = n+1} means that {\em vv.1} is the last subset;
      ++    trying to compute nextSubsetGray(vv) if {\em vv.2.1 = n+1}
      ++    will produce an error!
      ++ \end{items}
      ++ The other components of {\em vv.2} are needed to compute
      ++ nextSubsetGray efficiently.
      ++ Note: this is an implementation of [Williamson, Topic II, 3.54,
      ++ p. 112] for the special case {\em r1 = r2 = ... = rn = 2};
      ++ Note: nextSubsetGray produces a side-effect, i.e.
      ++ {\em nextSubsetGray(vv)} and {\em vv := nextSubsetGray(vv)}
      ++ will have the same effect.

++ Description:
++  Permanent implements the functions {\em permanent}, the 
++  permanent for square matrices.
Permanent(n : PositiveInteger, R : Ring with commutative("*")):
 public == private where
  I  ==> Integer
  L  ==> List
  V  ==> Vector
  SM  ==> SquareMatrix(n,R)
  VECTPKG1 ==> VectorPackage1(I)
  NNI ==> NonNegativeInteger
  PI ==> PositiveInteger
  GRAY ==> GrayCode
 
  public ==> with
 
    permanent:  SM  -> R
      ++ permanent(x) computes the permanent of a square matrix x.
      ++ The {\em permanent} is equivalent to 
      ++ the \spadfun{determinant} except that coefficients have 
      ++ no change of sign. This function
      ++ is much more difficult to compute than the 
      ++ {\em determinant}. The formula used is by H.J. Ryser,
      ++ improved by [Nijenhuis and Wilf, Ch. 19].
      ++ Note: permanent(x) choose one of three algorithms, depending
      ++ on the underlying ring R and on n, the number of rows (and
      ++ columns) of x:\begin{items}
      ++ \item 1. if 2 has an inverse in R we can use the algorithm of
      ++    [Nijenhuis and Wilf, ch.19,p.158]; if 2 has no inverse,
      ++    some modifications are necessary:
      ++ \item 2. if {\em n > 6} and R is an integral domain with characteristic
      ++    different from 2 (the algorithm works if and only 2 is not a
      ++    zero-divisor of R and {\em characteristic()$R ^= 2},
      ++    but how to check that for any given R ?),
      ++    the local function {\em permanent2} is called;
      ++ \item 3. else, the local function {\em permanent3} is called
      ++    (works for all commutative rings R).
      ++ \end{items}
