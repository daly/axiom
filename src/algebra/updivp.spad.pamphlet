++ Description: UnivariatePolynomialDivisionPackage provides a
++ division for non monic univarite polynomials with coefficients in
++ an \spad{IntegralDomain}.
UnivariatePolynomialDivisionPackage(R,UP): Exports == Implementation where
  R : IntegralDomain
  UP : UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R)
  N ==> NonNegativeInteger
  QR ==> Record(quotient: UP, remainder: UP)

  Exports ==> with

    divideIfCan: (UP,UP) -> Union(QR,"failed")
      ++ divideIfCan(f,g) returns quotient and remainder of the
      ++ division of f by g or "failed" if it has not succeeded.

  Implementation ==> add

    divideIfCan(p1:UP,p2:UP):Union(QR,"failed") ==
      zero? p2 => error "divideIfCan: division by zero"
--      one? (lc := leadingCoefficient p2) => monicDivide(p1,p2) 
      ((lc := leadingCoefficient p2) = 1) => monicDivide(p1,p2) 
      q: UP := 0
      while not ((e := subtractIfCan(degree(p1),degree(p2))) case "failed")
       repeat
        c := leadingCoefficient(p1) exquo lc
        c case "failed" => return "failed"
        ee := e::N
        q := q+monomial(c::R,ee)
        p1 := p1-c*mapExponents(#1+ee,p2)
      [q,p1]
