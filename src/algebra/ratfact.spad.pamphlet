++ Date last updated: December 1993
++ Factorization of extended polynomials with rational coefficients.
++ This package implements factorization of extended polynomials
++ whose coefficients are rational numbers. It does this by taking the
++ lcm of the coefficients of the polynomial and creating a polynomial
++ with integer coefficients. The algorithm in \spadtype{GaloisGroupFactorizer} is then
++ used to factor the integer polynomial. The result is normalized
++ with respect to the original lcm of the denominators.
++ Keywords: factorization, hensel, rational number
I  ==> Integer
RN ==> Fraction Integer
 
RationalFactorize(RP) : public == private where
  BP ==> SparseUnivariatePolynomial(I)
  RP : UnivariatePolynomialCategory RN
 
  public   ==> with
 
     factor           : RP ->  Factored RP
      ++ factor(p) factors an extended polynomial p over the rational numbers.
     factorSquareFree : RP -> Factored RP
      ++ factorSquareFree(p) factors an extended squareFree 
      ++ polynomial p over the rational numbers.
