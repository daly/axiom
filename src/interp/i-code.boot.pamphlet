--% Interpreter Code Generation Routines

--Modified by JHD 9/9/93 to fix a problem with coerces inside
--interpreter functions being used as mappings. They were being
--handled with $useCoerceOrCroak being NIL, and therefore internal
--coercions were not correctly handled. Fix: remove dependence
--on $useCoerceOrCroak, and test explicitly for Mapping types.
