\section{Notes}
Notes for understanding this makefile:

IMPORTANT: all source file names in this Makefile must be lowercase
This is for cross-platform compatibility and also makes getting
them into Lisp much easier at the Makefile level.

\section{The Environment}
We define 4 directories for this build. The first three are
the traditional {\bf IN}, which is where the source pamphlets are,
{\bf MID} which is where we will put the compiled intermediates and
{\bf OUT} which is where we will put the binaries.

In this case the {\bf IN} files are usually written in {\bf boot} \cite{2}.
These will be compiled in a {\bf BOOTSYS} image to translate from
{\bf boot} to Common Lisp. Since the Common Lisp code is 
system independent and machine generated code the {\bf MID} directory
is built in the {\bf \$SPAD/int} subtree. See the 
{\bf \$SPAD/Makefile.pamphlet} \cite{1} file for more details.

The Common Lisp code will be compiled from the {\bf MID} directory
into the {\bf OUT} directory. This is system-dependent,
machine-generated code and belongs in the {\bf \$SPAD/obj} subtree.

The dvi files will be generated from the pamphlet files in the
final ship doc/src/ directory. Since they are system independent 
but machine generated and part of the final ship they will exist 
in {\bf \$SPAD/mnt/sys/doc/src/interp}.

This creates all of the help files in the SPADHELP list from the
interpreter book (volume 5).

          ls *.help >spadhelp.files )

@

In order to minimize the size of the Axiom image at load time
we put some of the compiled files into a separate directory
that will be autoloaded on demand. This directory of code
will be shipped with the final system and so it belongs in
the {\bf \$SPAD/mnt} subtree.
<<environment>>=
AUTO=${MNT}/${SYS}/autoload

@

We need a raw lisp image that we can use as a base to construct
the other images. This is called {\bf LISPSYS} and is 
system-dependent and machine-generated.
It belongs in the {\bf \$SPAD/obj} subtree.
<<environment>>=
LISPSYS= ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/lisp

@

Most of the interpreter is written in {\bf boot} \cite{2}.
Thus we need a program to translate {\bf boot} to Common
Lisp. This is called the {\bf BOOTSYS} image (because the
translator is written in {\bf boot} and needs to translate
itself to bootstrap the system). This image is assumed to
have been built by a previous step in the make process.
<<environment>>=
BOOTSYS= ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/bootsys    

@

Some of the Common Lisp code we compile uses macros which
are assumed to be available at compile time. The {\bf DEPSYS}
image is created to contain the compile time environment
and saved. We pipe compile commands into this environment
to compile from Common Lisp to machine dependent code.

<<environment>>=
DEPSYS=	${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/depsys

@
The {\bf DEP} variable contains the list of files that
will be loaded into {\bf DEPSYS}. Notice that these files
are loaded in interpreted form. We are not concerned about
the compile time performance so we can use interpreted code.
We do, however, care about the macros as these will be
expanded in later compiles. All macros are assumed to be
in this list of files.
<<environment>>=
DEP= ${MID}/vmlisp.lisp    \
     ${MID}/foam_l.lisp \
     ${MID}/axext_l.lisp

@

Once we've compile all of the Common Lisp files we fire up
a clean lisp image called {\bf LOADSYS}, load all of the
final executable code and save it out as {\bf SAVESYS}.
The {\bf SAVESYS} image is copied to the [[${MNT}/${SYS}/bin]]
subdirectory and becomes the axiom executable image.
<<environment>>=
LOADSYS= ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/lisp
SAVESYS= ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/interpsys
AXIOMSYS= ${MNT}/${SYS}/bin/AXIOMsys

@
Occasionally we need to really get into the system internals.
The best way to do this is to run almost all of the lisp code
interpreted rather than compiled (note that cfuns.lisp and sockio.lisp
still need to be loaded in compiled form as they depend on the 
loader to link with lisp internals). This image is nothing more
than a load of the file src/interp/debugsys.lisp.pamphlet. If
you need to make test modifications you can add code to that
file and it will show up here.
<<environment>>=
DEBUGSYS=${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/debugsys

@

These are the files that need to be compiled (in {\bf BOOTSYS}),
loaded into a clean lisp image ({\bf LOADSYS}) and saved as
a runnable Axiom interpreter ({\bf SAVESYS}) usually named
{\bf interpsys}. Most of these files
are translated from {\bf boot} to Common Lisp and then 
compiled. There are two exceptions, {\bf bootfuns.lisp}
and {\bf setq.lisp}. The {\bf bootfuns.lisp} \cite{3} file
contains forward references for {\bf boot} code. The {\bf setq.lisp}
file contains constant initialization code which gains nothing
by being compiled.

The file http.lisp contains code to enable browser-based hyperdoc
and graphics.

Before we save the {\bf SAVESYS} image we need to run some
initialization code. These files perform initialization
for various parts of the system. The {\bf patches.lisp} \cite{5}
file contains last-minute changes to various functions and
constants.
<<environment>>=
INOBJS=	${OUT}/varini.${O}	${OUT}/parini.${O}	\
	${OUT}/intint.${O}	\
        ${OUT}/interop.${O}     ${OUT}/patches.${O}

@

Certain functions do not need to be in the running system.
If the running image never calls the compiler or does not
use the hypertex browser we will never call the functions
in these files. The code that calls these functions in the
running system will autoload the appropriate files the
first time they are called. Loading the files overwrites
the autoload function call and re-calls the function. 
Any subsequent calls will run the compiled code.

The {\bf OPOBJS} list contains files from the old parser. The use of
``old'' is something of a subtle concept as there were several
generations of ``old'' and all meaning of the term is lost.

<<environment>>=
# These are autloaded old parser files

The {\bf OCOBJS} list contains files from the old compiler. Again,
``old'' is meaningless. These files should probably be autoloaded.

browser. These files should probably be autoloaded.

	${AUTO}/br-con.${O}	\
	${AUTO}/topics.${O}     

@
The {\bf TRANOBJS} list contains files only used by the {\bf boot}
to Common Lisp translator and are probably never used by anyone
but the developers. These files should probably be autoloaded.

	  ${AUTO}/pspad2.${O} ${AUTO}/mark.${O} ${AUTO}/nspadaux.${O} 
	  
@

The {\bf NAGBROBJS} list contains files used to access the 
Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) fortran libraries. 
These files should probably be autoloaded.
Note that [[${AUTO}/nag-e02a.${O}]] is not included in this
list as it is a subset of [[${AUTO}/nag-e02.${O}]].
<<environment>>=
NAGBROBJS= ${AUTO}/nag-c02.${O}   ${AUTO}/nag-c05.${O} \

\cite{5} compiler. These files should probably be autoloaded.

The {\bf ASAUTO} list contains files used by the {\bf Aldor}
\cite{5} compiler. These files are autoloaded as needed.

Axiom versions are given as a string of the form:
"Sunday September 21, 2003 at 20:38:05 "
which describe the day, date, and time of the build.
This is used for reporting bugs. It is only partially useful
in identifying which source code was used. Ideally we could create
a tar file of all of the date/time stamps of all of the source files
and use the MD5 hash of that file as the version stamp. Ultimately
though, this would be chasing the elusive "perfect information" idea.

A new variable [[boot::*build-version*]] is set and used by the
{\tt yearweek} function to display the version number of the Axiom build.
This information is set by hand in the top level Makefile.
<<environment>>=
TIMESTAMP=${MNT}/${SYS}/timestamp
YEARWEEK=(progn (setq timestamp "${TIMESTAMP}") \
                (setq boot::*build-version* "${VERSION}") \
                (yearweek))

@
The {\bf .PRECIOUS} setting will keep make from deleting these
images if the build is stopped. Since once they are built they
are likely to be useable we don't need to redo the work if they
exist.
<<environment>>=

.PRECIOUS:	${BOOTSYS}
.PRECIOUS:	${DEPSYS}
.PRECIOUS:	${SAVESYS}

\section{Proclaim optimization}
GCL, and possibly other common lisps, can generate much better
code if the function argument types and return values are proclaimed.

In theory what we should do is scan all of the functions in the system
and create a file of proclaim definitions. These proclaim definitions
should be loaded into the image before we do any compiles so they can
allow the compiler to optimize function calling.

GCL has an approximation to this scanning which we use here. 

The first step is to build a version of GCL that includes [[gcl_collectfn]].
This file contains code that enhances the lisp compiler and creates a
hash table of structs. Each struct in the hash table describes information
that about the types of the function being compiled and the types of its
arguments. At the end of the compile-file this hash table is written out
to a ".fn" file. 

The second step is to build axiom images (depsys, interpsys, AXIOMsys)
which contain the [[gcl_collectfn]] code.

The third step is to build the system. This generates a .fn file for 
each lisp file that gets compiled.

The fourth step is to build the proclaims.lisp files. There is one
proclaims.lisp file for 
boot (boot-proclaims.lisp), 
interp (interp-proclaims.lisp), and 
algebra (algebra-proclaims.lisp).

To build the proclaims file (e.g. for interp) we:
\begin{verbatim}
(a) cd to obj/linux/interp
(b) (yourpath)/axiom/obj/linux/bin/lisp
(c) (load "sys-pkg.lsp") 
(d) (mapcar #'load (directory "*.fn"))
(e) (with-open-file 
     (out "interp-proclaims.lisp" :direction :output) 
      (compiler::make-proclaims out))
\end{verbatim}
Note that step (c) is only used for interp, not for boot.

The fifth step is to copy the newly constructed proclaims file back
into the src/interp diretory (or boot, algebra).

In order for this information to be used during compiles we define
<<environment>>=
PROCLAIMS=(progn (load "${OUT}/sys-pkg.lsp") \
                 (load "${IN}/interp-proclaims.lisp"))

@

\section{The warm.data file}
This is a file of commands that will be loaded into interpsys
at the last minute. It execute functions that will likely be
used in a running system so all of the required routines will
be in the lisp image thus minimizing their startup time.
<<warm.data.stanza>>=
${INT}/algebra/warm.data: 
	@ echo 2 building warm.data
	@ ${TANGLE} -Rwarm.data ${IN}/Makefile.pamphlet >${INT}/algebra/warm.data

\section{Building DEPSYS}
The depsys image proceeds all else. it is the compile-time environment
for all interpreter code. 

The ``:oldboot'' symbol is pushed on the features list 
because there is a function
in util.lisp that emulates the new boot parser command BOOTTOCL. since
we eventually plan to move to the new boot parser this function (and
the push) should disappear.

The load of postpar and parse (without extensions) allows the 
\verb+.${LISP}+
form to be loaded in a virgin system. However, if depsys is recreated then
the compiled form will get loaded.

This file contained the only mention of the AKCLDIR variable which
gives the path to the version of AKCL. Now that the system is running
on GCL this variable has been renamed to GCLDIR. This cannot be eliminated
entirely because the system uses this variable to look up a file 
called collectfn.lsp which is part of the GCL distribution. This
file lookup is in conditional lisp code so other lisps will not 
see the file load. The collectfn.lsp code is used by GCL to generate
the ``.fn'' files which are used to optimize function calling.

\subsection{save depsys image}
Once the appropriate commands are in the [[${OUT}/makedep.lisp]] file
we can load the file into a fresh image and save it. At least that's
how it used to work. In freebsd we cannot do this so we have to use
a much more complicated procedure.
This code used to read:
\begin{verbatim}
<<save depsys image>>=
	@ (cd ${MNT}/${SYS}/bin ; \
	   echo '(progn (load "${OUT}/makedep.lisp")' \
                '(spad-save "${DEPSYS}"))' | ${LISPSYS})
@
\end{verbatim}

Now game is much more difficult. 
\begin{verbatim}

 '(progn \

\end{verbatim}

[[si::*collect-binary-modules*]] instructs GCL to build a list of 
binary object modules loaded into the current session with (load ...)
The list will be stored in [[si::*binary-modules*]].
\begin{verbatim}

	       (setq si::*collect-binary-modules* t) \
	       (load "${OUT}/makedep.lisp") \

\end{verbatim}

[[compiler::link]] is a lisp interface to the ``ld'' C-based system linker.
The first argumet is a list of [[.o]] binary object modules to link into a
fresh gcl image. The second argument is the name of the new output
image.  The third argument is a string containing an initialization
command to run in the new image to reinitialize the heap.  The fourth
argument is a list of external C libraries, either static or dynamic,
that one wishes to link into the fresh image.  The last argument is a
flag which indicates whether GCL should initialize all of the freshly
linked in new lisp modules, or whether it should transparently
redirect load calls in the new image to initialization calls for the
already linked in module.

Some lisp systems, such as acl2, have a complex heap initialization,
in which load calls must be interspersed with other form evaluation
comprising the logic of the heap construction.  Others, such as
maxima, have no such complex initialization sequence.
\begin{verbatim}
  (compiler::link \
\end{verbatim}
[[si::*binary-modules*]] here has the list of compiled lisp binary module
.o files loaded by makedep.lsp above.
\begin{verbatim}
   (remove-duplicates si::*binary-modules* \
                      :test (quote equal)) \
\end{verbatim}

The name of the output image.
\begin{verbatim}
   "$(DEPSYS)" \
\end{verbatim}

This will be run in the newly linked sub-image.
\begin{verbatim}
    (format nil "\
\end{verbatim}

Collect loaded binary modules again to make sure that there are none,
as all should be already linked in via ld.  For error checking
purposes.
\begin{verbatim}
     (setq si::*collect-binary-modules* t) \
\end{verbatim}

We need to find [[gcl_collectfn.lsp]], so set the [[*load-path*]], and make
sure the source, not the binary, form is loaded here, as we're only
using this entire sequence on machines which cannot load binary object
modules and preserve them in saved images.
\begin{verbatim}
     (let ((si::*load-path* (cons ~S si::*load-path*))\
           (si::*load-types* ~S))\
\end{verbatim}

Turn on function analyzation and autoload thereby [[gcl_collectfn.lsp]].
\begin{verbatim}
      (compiler::emit-fn t))\
\end{verbatim}

Load the heap creation sequence again in the fresh new image, this
time transparently redirecting all calls to load of binary modules
invoked thereby into initialization calls for the already linkned in
module.

Load has code in it to recognize when a module is already linked in,
and to forgo in this case the actual load and replace with a mere
initialization call instead.
\begin{verbatim}
      (load \"$(OUT)/makedep.lisp\")\
      (gbc t)\
\end{verbatim}

It is an error to load a binary module. Calling load will not
reload them but only run initialization.
Throw an error if we've actually loaded any binary modules.
\begin{verbatim}
     (when si::*binary-modules* \
       (error si::*binary-modules*))\
\end{verbatim}

Unset the binary module collection flags.
\begin{verbatim}
    (setq si::collect-binary-modules* nil \xo
          si::*binary-modules* nil)\
    (gbc t)\
\end{verbatim}

Turn on SGC (Stratified Garbage Collection) in the final image.  This
is a optional gbc algorithm which is suitable for images which will
not grow much further.  It marks a large fraction of the heap
read-only, eliminating such pages from the time-consuming gbc
processing.  When writes are actually made to such pages, a segfault
is triggered which is handled by a function which remarks the pages
read-write and continues.
\begin{verbatim}
   (when (fboundp (quote si::sgc-on)) (si::sgc-on t))\
\end{verbatim}

This is a flag which instructs the GCL compiler to make unique
initialzation function C names.  This is necessary when using ld, as
all function names must be unique.
\begin{verbatim}
   (setq compiler::*default-system-p* t)\
\end{verbatim}
si::*system-directory* goes into the *load-path*, and .lsp in the *load-types*.
\begin{verbatim}
 " si::*system-directory* (quote (list ".lsp")))\
\end{verbatim}
No C libraries to link in here.
\begin{verbatim}
   "" \
\end{verbatim}

Do not run the initialization code for the newly linked in lisp
modules ``by hand'', but rather rely on the transparent load redirection
described above to initialize at the proper moment in the heap
initialization sequence.

\section{Building SAVESYS and AXIOMSYS}
GCL likes to tell you when it has replaced a function call by a 
tail-recursive call. This happens when the last form in a function
is a call to the same function. In general, we don't care so we set
compiler::*suppress-compiler-notes* to true in order to reduce the noise.

\subsection{debugsys.lisp \cite{14}}
The {\bf debugsys.lisp} file is used to create a {\bf debugsys} runnable image.
This image contains almost all of the lisp code that make up the axiom
interpreter in lisp form. It is useful for deep system debugging but
otherwise worthless. This file is certain to drift over time as changes
are made elsewhere to add or remove files. It is assumed that you know
what you are doing if you change this file or use debugsys.

This file is basically the same as the one created during the build of
interpsys. See the echo lines in the {\bf SAVESYS} block above. These
are echoed into a temporary file which gets loaded into the lisp image.
We simply captured that temporary file, replaced the .o files with .lisp
files (or .lsp or .clisp) and saved it here.

Note that the {\bf c-util.boot.pamphlet} file contains both the
original {\bf boot} code and a saved copy of the {\bf c-util.clisp}
code. We need to keep the translated code around so we can bootstrap
the system. In other words, we need this boot code translated so we
can build the boot translator.

{\bf note: if you change the boot code in c-util.boot.pamphlet
you must translate this code to lisp and store the resulting lisp
code back into the c-util.boot.pamphlet file. this is not automated.}

\subsection{slam.boot}
Note that the {\bf slam.boot.pamphlet} file contains both the
original {\bf boot} code and a saved copy of the {\bf slam.clisp}
code. We need to keep the translated code around so we can bootstrap
the system. In other words, we need this boot code translated so we
can build the boot translator.

{\bf note: if you change the boot code in slam.boot.pamphlet
you must translate this code to lisp and store the resulting lisp
code back into the slam.boot.pamphlet file. this is not automated.}

\section{The databases}
\subsection{autoload dependencies}
If you are adding a file which is to be autoloaded the following step
information is useful. There are 2 cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item adding files to currently autoloaded parts\\
(as of 2/92: browser old parser and old compiler)
\item adding new files
\begin{itemize}
\item case 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item [(a)] you have to add the file to the list of files currently there
(e.g. see BROBJS above)
\item [(b)] add an autolaod rule
(e.g. ${AUTO}/parsing.${O}: ${OUT}/parsing.${O})
\item [(c)] edit util.lisp to add the 'external' function (those that
should trigger the autoload
\end{itemize}
\item case 2:\\
     build-interpsys (in util.lisp) needs an extra argument for the
     new autoload things and several functions in util.lisp need hacking.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
database.date is a marker file used to force a rebuild of interpsys if the
database is rebuilt (src/algebra/Makefile).
