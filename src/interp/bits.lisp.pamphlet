;;; The types "bit" and "bit vector" are implemented differently
;;; in different variants of lisp.
;;; These lisp macros/functions will have different implementations 
;;; on different lisp systems.

;;; The operations which traverse entire vectors are given as functions
;;; since the function calling overhead will be relatively small.
;;; The operations which extract or set a single part of the vector are
;;; provided as macros.
