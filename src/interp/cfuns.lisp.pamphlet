The MYCOMBINE function causes a problem as of GCL-2.6.8pre.
Camm has rewritten it. This used to read:
\begin{verbatim}
#+(AND KCL (NOT ELF))
(Clines
"unsigned int MYCOMBINE(i,j)"
"unsigned int i,j;"
"{"
"return ( (((j & 16777215) @<< 6)+i) % 1073741789);"
"}"
)
\end{verbatim}

#+(AND KCL (NOT ELF))

"}"
