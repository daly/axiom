Abstract Syntax Trees

This file provides functions to create and examine abstract
syntax trees.  These are called pform, for short.
The definition of valid pforms see ABSTRACT BOOT.

!! This file also contains constructors for concrete syntax, although
!! they should be somewhere else.

THE PFORM DATA STRUCTURE
 Leaves: [hd, tok, pos]
 Trees:  [hd, tree, tree, ...]
 hd is either an id or (id . alist)
