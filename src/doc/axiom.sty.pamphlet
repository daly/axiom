%%% Axiom Literate Programming Chunk Support
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This document describes the {\TeX} code that supports {\tt noweave}
and {\tt noweb}. It also defines the {\TeX} support for {\tt Axiom}.
Those interested in customizing their output should
focus on Section~\ref{section:sty}.  
Hooks you can easily use (apart from those provided by
[[\noweboptions]]) are indicated by marginal notes.
This file contains both plain {\TeX} and {\LaTeX} support:

\section{Latex Chunk support}
This is the chunk environment that replaces the use of web-like tools

\begin{verbatim}
To use the command you would write
   \begin{chunk}{some random string}
   random code to be verbatim formatted
   \end{chunk}

 This version prints 
                    --- some random string ---
   random code to be verbatim formatted
                    --------------------------
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% The verbatim package quotes everything within its grasp and is used to
%%% hide and quote the source code during latex formatting. The verbatim
%%% environment is built in but the package form lets us use it in our
%%% chunk environment and it lets us change the font.

\section{Basic {\TeX} support for {\tt Axiom}}

This basic code is used for both {\TeX} and {\LaTeX}.
The first step is to define [[\codehsize]], which is the width in
which code is set, and [[\codemargin]], which is the amount by which
it is indented.\stylehook

Most code is set in an environment in which [[\setupcode]] has been
executed.
In this environment, only [[\]], [[{]], and [[}]] have their usual
categories; every other character represents itself.
Appropriate [[\chardef]]s ensure that the special characters can be
escaped with a backslash.

[[\eatline]] is used to consume newlines that should be ignored,

{\tt noweave} brackets uses of chunk names with [[\LA]] and [[\RA]], which
handle the angle brackets, font, and environment.

As it stands, chunk names can be broken across lines (or pages).  This
could result in unnecessary page breaks in code
(c.f.~p.~\pageref{sec:pagebreaking}).  [[\let\\maybehbox=\mbox]] to
\stylehook
avoid breaking them
(or to make them work in math mode); this is done in code chunks, but could be done
in general.

We have to be careful with font-changing in the presence of
different font-selection schemes.  In the \LaTeX{} New Font Selection
Scheme something like [[\it\tt]] will attempt to use an italic
typewriter font.  Thus we define new commands like [[\Tt]] which will
work with both the Plain and old and new \LaTeX{} schemes.  (Note that
NFSS will be standard in the next version of \LaTeX.)  A problem with
these definitions arises with NFSS: in math mode the won't work
unless the {\tt oldlfont} backwards-compatibility option is in effect.
For the moment, you can get round this by using [[\mbox]].

If you wanted code set in a different font, you could re-define
[[\Tt]].\stylehook{}  [\LaTeX2e actually behaves like OFSS, but the
extra [[\reset@font]] does no harm.]

\subsection{Page-breaking strategy}\label{sec:pagebreaking}

We want to insert penalties aiming for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
No page breaks in the middle of a code chunk unless necessary to avoid
an overfull vbox;
\item 
Documentation immediately preceding a code chunk should appear on
the same page as that code chunk unless doing so would violate rule 1.
\end{enumerate}
[[\filbreak]] is useful for this sort of thing (see {\em The \TeX
  book\/}) and is used to encourage breaks at the right places between
chunks.  Appropriate penalties are inserted elsewhere, between code
lines in particular.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Environments for setting code}

[[\nwbegincode]] and [[\nwendcode]] are used by {\tt noweave} to bracket
code chunks.
The [[webcode]] environment is intended for users who want to paste
{\tt noweave} output into papers.

The definition of [[\nwbegincode]] is based on the verbatim
implementation in {\tt verbatim.sty}, which will, presumably be in the
next version of \LaTeX\@.  One thing it does differently, apart from
the catcode changes is setting [[\linewidth]]; this will avoid some
overfull hboxen when the code lines are too long, but the lines won't
be broken anyhow (even within chunk names because of the
[[\maybehbox]] definition).

The [[\trivlist]] clich\'e isn't quite a clich\'e because we adjust
[[\leftskip]] for indentation by [[\codemargin]] and adjust
[[\rightskip]] to allow lines up to [[\codehsize]] long without
overfull boxen
($\mbox{[[\codehsize]]}=\mbox{[[\hsize]]}+\mbox{[[\rightskip]]}$).
Note that [[\hsize]] isn't altered.

Note the bug lurking somewhere in this code, as reported by Steven Ooms:
\begin{quote}
I have some lay-out
problems in the documentation chunks.  When using the (La)TeX commands
[[\hline]] or [[\vtop]] the right margin is always extended far beyond the page
margin after the first code chunk has been typeset.  I'm still looking for
the exact cause of it, but to me it seems that LaTeX supposes for those
commands that the line width for the documentation chunk is as large as that
for code chunks, which isn't true in reality.

{\tt noweave} uses [[\nwbegindocs{nnn}]] and [[\nwenddocs]] to bracket
documentation chunks.
If a documentation chunk does not continue the current paragraph, 
{\tt noweave} inserts [[\nwdocspar]], which uses
[[\filbreak]] in an attempt to keep the documentation chunk on the
same page as the code chunk that follows it.  (The code chunk will
have another [[\filbreak]] after it---see [[\nwbegincode]].)
[[\nwbegindocs]] doesn't start a
new paragraph if the previous chunk didn't end one, i.e.\ didn't enter
vmode; if it does start a new one, it's only indented by the use of
[[\nwdocspar]].

\subsection{Chunk cross-reference}

[[\nwalsodefined]], [[\nwused]], and [[\nwnotused]] are emitted by the {\tt
noweb} cross-referencers. (What arguments?)
If unused chunks are output chunks, a filter can slip in
[[\let\nwnotused\nwoutput]].
The style uses [[\nwcodecomment]] for all annotations that follow code
chunks.
Fiddling with it can change the appearance of the output.
Note that [[\nwcodecomment]] is used after [[\nwbegincode]], with
[[\obeylines]] in efect.  Since linebreaking can occur here, we need
to change the [[\interlinepenalty]].
A little vertical space ([[\nwcodecommentsep]]\stylehook) appears before the first
comment.

We firkled with [[\rightskip]] in [[\nwbegincode]] above; now we want to
reset it so that paragraphs are the normal width ([[\textwidth]],
possibly less [[\codemargin]]) and set ragged right.  This is done as
usuall by making [[\rightskip]] naturally zero but stretchable.

\subsection{Sub-page references}

This is the wonderful code that Dave Love provided to make page
references like 7a, 7b, and so on.

This code
provides a mechanism for defining `page
sub-references' using [[\sublabel{foo}]] referenced with
[[\subpageref{foo}]].  Sub-references will be numbered like these real
examples: \subpageref{ref:foo}, \subpageref{ref:bar},
\subpageref{ref:baz}\sublabel{ref:foo}\sublabel{ref:bar}\sublabel{ref:baz}
etc.\ unless there is only one on the page, in which case the letter
will be dropped like this: \subpageref{ref:fred}.

To be able to use [[\subpageref]] we must define the label with
[[\sublabel]], used like label.  (Using
[[\ref]] with a label defined by [[\sublabel]] will
produce the sub-reference number, by the way, and [[\pageref]]
works as expected.)  Note that
[[\subpageref]] is robust and [[\ref]] and [[\pageref]] are redefined to be
robust also, as they will be in future \LaTeX{} releases.
Incidentally, these expand to the relevant text plus [[\null]]---you
might want to strip this off, e.g.\ for sorting lists.


There are various ways we could attack this task (which is made
non-trivial by the well-known asynchrony of (La)\TeX's output
routine), but
they all must depend on hacks in the [[.aux]] file or a similar one.
Joachim Schrod's [[fnpag.sty]] does the same sort of thing differently
to this \LaTeX-specific approach.  See [[latex.tex]] for enlightenment
on the cross-referencing mechanism and the \LaTeX{} internals used
below.  [DL: The internals change in \LaTeX2e compared with
\LaTeX~2.09.  The code here still works, though.]
@
The new-style {\LaTeX} page-reference macros all work the same way: 
if the thing is undefined, barf.  Otherwise, do the specified thing.
We need to handle the fact that the expansion of the label may be two
items or five items, depending on whether hypertext is used.
Since we're only ever interested in the first two items, we use a
hack---the ``do the specified thing'' must be defined as
\mbox{[[\def\dome#1#2#3\\{...}]]} where [[...]] uses only the first two parameters.
<<axiom.sty>>=
\providecommand\nw@genericref[2]{% what to do, name of ref
  \expandafter\nw@g@nericref\csname r@#2\endcsname#1{#2}}
\providecommand\nw@g@nericref[3]{% control sequence, what to do, name
  \ifx#1\relax
    \ref{#3}% trigger the standard `undefined ref' mechanisms
  \else
    \expandafter#2#1.\\%
  \fi}
@ Much of what we want can be done by pulling out the first, second,
or first and second elements of a ref.

\def\nw@selectone#1#2#3\\{#1}
\def\nw@selecttwo#1#2#3\\{#2}
\def\nw@selectonetwo#1#2#3\\{{#1}{#2}}
@
The [[\subpageref]] macro first does a normal [[\pageref]].  If the
reference is actually defined, it then goes on to check whether the
control sequence [[2on]]\LA{}{page referenced}\RA{} is defined and sets the
[[\ref]] value to get [[a]] etc.\ if so.  The magic, of course, is in
defining the [[2on]] bit appropriately.
[[\subpageref]] also tries to include the right hyperstuff for xhdvi.

@
[[\sublabel]] is like the [[\label]] command, except that it writes
[[\newsublabel]] onto the [[.aux]] file rather than [[\newlabel]].
For hyperreferencing, all labels must be hypertext 
anchors, for which we use [[\nwblindhyperanchor]].
<<axiom.sty>>=
\providecommand{\sublabel}[1]{%
  \@bsphack
  \nwblindhyperanchor{#1}%
  \if@filesw {\let\thepage\relax

@
[[\newsublabel]] is the macro that does the important work.  It is called with the
same sort of arguments as [[\newlabel]]: the first argument is the
label name and the second is  [[{<<ref value>>}{<<page number>>}]].
(Note that the only definition here which needs to be
global is the one which is, and that [[\global]] is redefined by
[[\enddocument]], which will bite you if you use it\dots)
<<axiom.sty>>=
<<definition of [[\newsublabel]]>>
@
Before we create a [[\newsublabel]] for the first time, we set the
proper trailers.
<<definition of [[\newsublabel]]>>=
\providecommand\newsublabel{%
  \nw@settrailers
  \global\let\newsublabel\@newsublabel
  \@newsublabel}
@ First we extract the page number into [[\this@page]].
<<definition of [[\newsublabel]]>>=
\providecommand{\@newsublabel}[2]{%
  \edef\this@page{\@cdr#2\@nil}%
@
Then we see whether it's changed from the value of [[\last@page]]
which was stashed away by the last [[\newsublabel]] (or is [[\relax]] if
this is the first one).  If the page has changed, we reset the
counter [[\sub@page]] telling us how many sub-labels there have been
on the page.
<<definition of [[\newsublabel]]>>=
  \ifx\this@page\last@page\else
    \sub@page=\z@
  \fi
  \edef\last@page{\this@page}
  \advance\sub@page by \@ne
@
If we've had at least two on the page, we define the 
[[2on]]\LA{}{page no.}\RA{} macro to indicate the fact.
<<definition of [[\newsublabel]]>>=
  \ifnum\sub@page=\tw@
    \global\@namedef{2on\this@page}{}%
  \fi
@
\nextchunklabel{cl1}\nextchunklabel{cl2}
Then we write a normal [[\newlabel]] with the sub-reference as the
normal reference value in the second argument.
Unfortunately, if we want hypertext support, the second argument of
[[\newlabel]] gets complicated.
It is either
\begin{itemize}
\item
[[{<<ref value>>}{<<page number>>}]], when normal {\LaTeX} is
running, or
\item
[[{<<ref value>>}{<<page number>>}{<<text>>}}{<<hyper category>>}{<<URL>>}]],
when the \texttt{hyperref} package is running.
(We actually detect this by looking for the \texttt{nameref} package,
because that's the one that changes the use of labels.)
\end{itemize}
We unify these two things by producing
[[{<<ref value>>}{<<page number>>}\nw@labeltrailers]]

We may have pending labels in support of [[\nextchunklabel]], as defined in
chunk~\subpageref{chunklabel}. 
Because we want to define all of the ``pending sublabels'' in exactly
the same way, we do something a bit odd---we make the current label a
pending label as well.
<<definition of [[\newsublabel]]>>=
  \pendingsublabel{#1}%
  \edef\@tempa##1{\noexpand\newlabel{##1}%
    {{\number\sub@page}{\this@page}\nw@labeltrailers}}%
  \pending@sublabels
  \def\pending@sublabels{}}
@ 
We can't use [[\@ifpackageloaded]] to see if \texttt{nameref} is
loaded, because that is restricted to the preamble, and
[[\newsublabel]] goes into the [[.aux]] file, which is executed after
the whole document is processed.
We therefore test for [[\@secondoffive]].
This is lame, but what else can we do?
<<axiom.sty>>=
\providecommand\nw@settrailers{% -- won't work on first run
  \@ifpackageloaded{nameref}%
     {\gdef\nw@labeltrailers{{}{}{}}}%

     {\gdef\nw@labeltrailers{}}%
     {\gdef\nw@labeltrailers{{}{}{}}}}
@ 
Now we keep track of those pending guys.\nextchunklabel{chunklabel}
The goal here is to save them up until they're all equivalent to the
label on the next chunk.
We have to control expansion so chunks like \subpageref{cl1}
(\subpageref{cl2}) can be labelled twice.

@ 
In rare cases, there may be more than 26 chunks on a page.
In such a case, we need a sub-page numbering scheme that can go beyond
``a to z.''
The scheme I have chosen is ``a to z, then aa to zz, then aaa to zzz,
etc.''
The conversion requires a bit of thought because it is \emph{not} an
ordinary conversion of integer to string as we usually think of such
things.
The problem is that the meaning of the letters depends on the
position; the letter~a acts like a zero in some positions or a one in
others.

The solution I have implemented uses a variable [[bound]] which is
always equal to $26^k$ for some~$k$.
If we write the recurrence $B_k = B_{k-1} + 26^k$, with $B_0 = 0$, we
then use a string of~$k$ letters to represent numbers between
$B_{k-1}$~and~$B_k$.
Within that string, a's are 0's, and so on up to z's which are 25's,
and we use standard integer-conversion methods to encode $n-B_{k-1}$.

The following Icon implementation may be more perspicuous than the
{\TeX} code actually used.
Here the variable [[bound]] is $26^k$, with $k=1$ initially, and
[[n]]~is $n-B_{k-1}$.
The first loop finds the right~$k$, and the second does the usual
string conversion.
<<Icon code for subpage numbering>>=
procedure alphastring(n)
  bound := 26

  while n >= bound do {
    # invariant: bound = 26^(k+1) & n is initial n - B_k
    n -:= bound
    bound *:= 26
  }
  
  while bound > 1 do {
    bound /:= 26
    d := integer(n / bound)
    n -:= d * bound
    writes(&lcase[d+1])
  }
end
@ 
Here's {\TeX} code to achieve the same end.
The entire macro body is enclosed in braces, so that it can be used
with [[\loop]] without picking up the wrong [[\repeat]].

\subsection{Support for Prettyprinting}

The following macro can be redefined to allow custom typesetting of
identifiers in the index and mini-indices.
<<axiom.sty>>=
\let\nwixident=\relax
@ 
@
The following macros can be redefined to typeset `[[\]]', `[[{]]' and
`[[}]]' correctly in non-typewriter fonts. 
The problem is that the built-in {\LaTeX} [[\{]] tries to produce a
math symbol, which doesn't exist in the typewriter font, so we get a
brace in the wrong font and a warning.  Most unpleasant.
Noweave therefore attempts to emit [[\nwlbrace]] and [[\nwrbrace]]
wherever it believes braces should appear.
The standard noweb style is to set code in typewriter font, and so the
standard definitions just select the proper characters from that font.
 People setting code in
fonts other than typewriter are responsible for redefining those
macros to work in their environment.

\subsection{Language-dependent macros} 

Miguel Filgueiras
(DCC-FCUP \& LIACC, Universidade do Porto) provided some changes to
add multilingual support for the words Noweb uses in indexing and
cross-reference.
He inserted macros that are defined by, e.g., [[\noweboptions{english}]].
The Noweb package uses the
(apparently standard) {\LaTeX} macro [[\languagename]] to select a
language at load time.
If the \texttt{babel} package is
loaded (with the appropriate language name) before Noweb is loaded, 
the Noweb package will select language appropriately, provided the
language is one of those Noweb supports.
Mr.~Filgueiras provided support for English,
Portuguese, German, and French. 
He notes that the French is
faulty; the translations may be poort, and there are
bugs in the implementation that he could not solve.

\label{subsection:langdeps}

The language-dependent macros are defined here in each supported
language in a different subsubsection.

The choice of language depends on testing the [[\languagename]]
macro. There must be a more elegant way of coding the tests below\ldots
<<axiom.sty>>=
<<language support>>
\ifx\languagename\undefined % default is English
  \noweboptions{english}
\else
  \@ifundefined{nwopt@\languagename}
     {\noweboptions{english}}
     {\expandafter\noweboptions\expandafter{\languagename}}

\subsubsection{Support for French}

This is a tentative translation to French.
Although NR has made some corrections, it should probably be
reviewed by a native speaker.

There are problems with using accents: on the [[\@nwlangdepnvd]] macro
(which apparently is not used in the context of [[\nwcodecomment]]),
and in some other macros (\LaTeX{} complains about missing
[[\endcsname]]). This should be fixed by someone with experience in
using \TeX\ldots

\section{More Macros for Pamphlet Files}

This section defines additional macros for use in pamphlet files.
More specifically, it provides support for typesetting file names,
tool names, etc.
<<axiom.sty>>=
%% typeset e.g. and i.e.
\providecommand{\eg}{\emph{e.g.}}
\providecommand{\ie}{\emph{i.e.}}
\newdimen\xmpWidth \xmpWidth=29pc
\def\axiomType#1{{\sf #1}}
\def\spadtype{\axiomType}
\def\axiomFun#1{{\bf #1}%
\index{library!operations!#1 @\begingroup \string\bf{} #1 \endgroup}}
\def\spadfun{\axiomFun}
\long\def\texht#1#2{#1}


%% Typeset in-line code.
\providecommand{\Code}[1]{\texttt{#1}}

%% Typeset a file name
\providecommand{\File}[1]{{\itshape{#1}}}

%% Typeset a tool name, e.g. Axiom
\providecommand{\Tool}[1]{{\bfseries\sffamily{#1}}}

\section{Computer Algebra names support for CATS test suite}

We need to be able to mark the various computer algebra sections
that follow each test case. In order to do that we define our own commands.
If we were more of a tex hacker we'd generalize these to take an argument
that was the system name.
<<axiom.sty>>=
\providecommand\AXIOM{\vskip\parindent\indent{\bf AXIOM}\vskip\parindent\noindent\ignorespaces}
\providecommand\maxima{\vskip\parindent\noindent{\bf MAXIMA}\vskip\parindent\noindent\ignorespaces}
\providecommand\yacas{\vskip\parindent\noindent{\bf YACAS}\vskip\parindent\noindent\ignorespaces}
