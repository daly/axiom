\section{Executive Overview}
\section{Signals}
The system defines a set of signals that may be delivered to a process. Signal 
delivery resembles the occurrence of a hardware interrupt: the signal is 
normally blocked from further occurrence, the current process context is saved, 
and a new one is built. A process may specify a {\sl handler} to which a signal 
is delivered, or specify that a signal is to be {\sl ignored}. A process may 
also specify that a default action is to be taken by the system when a signal 
occurs. A signal may also be {\sl blocked}, in which case its delivery is 
postponed until it is {\sl unblocked}. The action to be taken on delivery is 
determined at the time of delivery. Normally, signal handlers execute on the 
current stack of the process. This may be changed, on a per-handler basis, so 
that signals are taken on a special {\sl signal stack}.

Signal routines normally execute with the signal that caused their invocation 
{\sl blocked}, but other signals may yet occur. A global {\sl signal mask} 
defines the set of signals currently blocked from delivery to a process. 
The signal mask for a process is initialized from that of its parent 
(normally empty). It may be changed with a {\bf sigprocmask(2)} call, or 
when a signal is delivered to the process.

When a signal condition arises for a process, the signal is added to a set of 
signals pending for the process. If the signal is not currently {\sl blocked} 
by the process then it is delivered to the process. Signals may be delivered 
any time a process enters the operating system (e.g., during a system call, 
page fault or trap, or clock interrupt). If muliple signals are ready to be 
delivered at the same time, any signals that could be caused by traps are 
delivered first. Additional signals may be processed at the same time, with 
each appearing to interrupt the handlers for the previous signals before 
their first instructions. The set of pending signals is retuned by the 
{\bf sigpending(2)} system call. When a caught signal is delivered, the current 
state of the process is saved, a new signal mask is calculated (as described 
below), and the signal handler is invoked. The call to the handler is arranged 
so that if the signal handling routine returns normally the process will resume 
execution in the context from before the signal's delivery. If the process 
wishes to resume in a different context, then it must arrange to restore 
the previous context itself.

When a signal is delivered to a proces a new signal mask is installed for the 
duration of the process's signal handler (or until a {\bf sigprocmask(2)} 
system call is made). This mask is formed by taking the union of the current 
signal mask set, the signal to be delivered, and the signal mask associated 
with the handler to be invoked.

The {\bf sigaction()} system call assigns an action for a signal specified by 
{\sl sig}. If {\sl act} is non-zero, it specifies an action (SIG\_DFL, SIG\_IGN, 
or a handler routine) and mask to be used when delivering the specified signal. 
If {\sl oact} is non-zero, the previous handling information for the signal is 
returned to the user.

Once a signal handler is installed, it normally  remains installed until another 
{\bf sigaction()} system call is made, or an {\sl execve(2)} is performed. A 
signal-specific default action may be reset by setting {\sl sa\_handler} to 
SIG\_DFL. The defaults are process termination, possibly with core dump; 
no action; stopping the process; or continuing the process. See the signal 
list below for each signal's default action. If {\sl sa\_handler} is SIG\_DFL, 
the default action for the signal is to discard the signal, and if a signal 
is pending, the pending signal is discarded even if the signal is masked. If 
{\sl sa\_handler} is set to SIG\_IGN current and pending instances of the signal 
are ignored and discarded.

Options may be specified by setting {\sl sa\_flags}. 
The meaning of the various bits is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf SA\_NOCLDSTOP} If this bit is set when installing a catching 
function for the SIGCHLD signal, the SIGCHLD signal will  be generated 
only when a child process exits, not when a child process stops.
\item {\bf SA\_NOCLDWAIT}
If this bit is set when calling {\sl sigaction()} for the
SIGCHLD signal, the system will not create zombie processes
when children of the calling process exit. If the calling
process subsequently issues a {\sl wait()} (or equivalent),
it blocks until all of the calling process's child processes
terminate, and then returns a value of -1 with errno set to
ECHILD.
\item {\bf SA\_ONSTACK} If this bit is set, the system will deliver the 
signal to the process on a {\sl signal stack}, specified with
{\bf sigaltstack(2)}.
\item {\bf SA\_NODEFER} If this bit is set, further occurrences of the 
delivered signal are not masked during the execution of the handler.
\item {\bf SA\_RESETHAND} If this bit is set, the handler is reset 
to SIG\_DFL at the moment the signal is delivered.
\item {\bf SA\_RESTART} See the paragraph below
\item {SA\_SIGINFO} If this bit is set, the handler function is assumed to 
be pointed to by the sa\_sigaction member of struct sigaction
and should match the prototype shown above or as below in
EXAMPLES. This bit should not be set when assigning SIG\_DFL
or SIG\_IGN
\end{itemize}
If a signal is caught during the system calls listed below, the call may be 
forced to terminate with the error EINTR, the call may return with a data 
transfer shorter than requested, or the call may be restarted. Restart of 
pending calls is requested by setting the SA\_RESTART bit in {\sl sa\_flags}. 
The affected system calls include {\bf open(2)}, {\bf read(2)}, {\bf write(2)}, 
{\bf sendto(2)}, {\bf recvfrom(2)}, {\bf sendmsg(2)} and {\bf recvmsg(2)} 
on a communications channel or a slow device (such as a terminal, but not a 
regular file) and during a {\bf wait(2)} or {\bf ioctl(2)}. However, calls 
that have already committed are not restarted, but instead return a partial 
success (for example, a short read count).

After a {\bf fork(2)} or {\bf vfork(2)} all signals, the signal mask, the 
signal stack, and the restart/interrupt flags are inherited by the child.

The {\bf execve(2)} system call reinstates the default action for all signals 
which were caught and resets all signals to be caught on the user stack. 
Ignored signals remain ignored; the signal mask remains the same; signals 
that restart pending system calls continue to do so.

The following is a list of all signals with names in the include file
{\sl $<$signal.h$>$}:

\end{tabular}

The {\sl sigaction()} function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise 
the value -1 is returned and the global variable {\sl errno} is set to indicate 
the error.

Signal handlers should have either the ANSI C prototype:
\begin{verbatim}
  void handler(int);
\end{verbatim}
or the POSIX SA\_SIGINFO prototype:
\begin{verbatim}
  void handler(int, siginfo_t *info, ucontext_t *uap);
\end{verbatim}

The handler function should match the SA\_SIGINFO prototype 
when the SA\_SIGINFO 
bit is set in flags. It then should be pointed to by the sa\_sigaction member 
of struct sigaction. Note that you should not assign SIG\_DFL or SIG\_IGN this way.

If the SA\_SIGINFO flag is not set, the handler function should match either 
the ANSI C or traditional BSD prototype and be pointed to by the sa\_handler 
member of struct sigaction. In practice, FreeBSD always sends the three 
arguments of the latter and since the ANSI C prototype is a subset, both 
will work. The sa\_handler member declaration in FreeBSD include files is 
that of ANSI C (as required by POSIX), so a function pointer of a BSD-style 
function needs to be casted to compile without warning. The traditional BSD 
style is not portable and since its capabilities are a full subset of a 
SA\_SIGNFO handler its use is deprecated.

The {\sl sig} argument is the signal number, one of the SIG\ldots values from 
{\sl <signal.h>}.

The {\sl code} argument of the BSD-style handler and the si\_code member of the
info argument to a SA\_SIGINFO handler contain a numeric code explaining the
cause of the signal, usually on of the SI\_\ldots values from {\sl <sys/signal.h>}
or codes specific to a signal, i.e. one of the FPE\_\ldots values for SIGFPE.

The {\sl uap} argument to a POSIX SA\_SIGINFO handler points to an instance of 
ucontext\_t.

The {\bf sigaction()} system call will fail and no new signal handler will be
installed if one of the following occurs:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf [EFAULT]} Either {\sl act} or {\sl oact} points to memory that 
is not a valid part of the process address space
\item {\bf [EINVAL]} The {\sl sig} argument is not a valid signal number
\item {\bf [EINVAL]} An attempt is made to ignore or supply a handler 
for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP
\end{itemize}
\section{MAC OSX and BSD platform change}

#include "bsdsignal.h"

@
The MACOSX platform is broken because no matter what you do it seems to
include files from [[/usr/include/sys]] ahead of [[/usr/include]]. On linux
systems these files include themselves which causes an infinite regression
of includes that fails. GCC gracefully steps over that problem but the
build fails anyway. On MACOSX the [[/usr/include/sys]] versions 
of files are badly broken with respect to the [[/usr/include]] versions.

We needed to change [[SIGCLD]] to [[SIGCHLD]] for the [[MAC OSX]] platform
and we need to create a new platform variable. This change is made to 
propogate that platform variable.
