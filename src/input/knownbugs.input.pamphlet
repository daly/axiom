\subsection{bug8: 325 Severe bug in normalize\$EFSTRUC}
There is a severe bug in normalize\$EFSTRUC, which affects
summation ('innersum\$SUMFS), maybe also integration.

sub\$SUMFS uses this method to check whether a function is
rational for Gosper, and thus returns completely false results,
which are difficult to detect.

This is listed as bug \#325 on IssueTracker

Although this is very nice (I tried it!), it only steps around the bug
in rischNormalize, since the latter is not called with the same
arguments: your patches make axiom simplify T/eval(T, n=n-1) right
away. Although this is a very good thing, I suspect that the bug in
rischNormalize will surface under other circumstances, too.

I will comment on your patches in a separate email tomorrow, but I'd
like to express my joy about your work on EXPR and friends. I do have
some - hopefully constructive - critisism, though.

Meanwhile I did a bit of tracing. It seems likely that the bug occurs
in expeval, possibly in goodCoef. Here is the relevant bit of the
trace:

             (%e               )              n log(t)
   [func= -------------------------, kers= [%e        ],
                         +-----+  2
             (n - 1)log(\|t + 1 )
          (%e                    )
                       +-----+
                n log(\|t + 1 )

             (n - 1)log(\|t + 1 )
           %e

Note that the expeval replaces the elements of "kers" with the
elements of "vals", but here, these are clearly not equivalent: kers
contains t^n, vals however sqrt(t+1).

Maybe this is simply an index mismatch: The length of the fourth
argument to expeval and goodCoef is four, but I have the feeling that
it is meant to refer to the elements of the second argument which are
of the form exp... or log..., and thus sqrt(t+1) should not be
counted. In other words, maybe goodCoef should rather return [index=
4, ker= log(sqrt(t+1))] or so.

Dear Waldek,

thanks for your explanations.

I meant that it is not clear what the coefficient field for
rischNormalize is: rischNormalize works over F, which is a
"FunctionSpace R".

To fix things, suppose that F is EXPR INT and the expression we
consider contains only one variable. I guess the field of constants is
the field of "numeric" elements from EXPR INT, i.e., expressions that
do not contain a variable.

Of course, this is still not a computable coefficient field. However,
in this case it is at least clear mathematically what
sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)-sqrt(6) is supposed to be.

Now, if we switch to a field of constants containing some variables,
what about sqrt(x)*sqrt(y)-sqrt(x*y)?

There are some related axioms defined in attreg.spad (namely
canonicalUnitNormal, unitsKnown and canonical). In any case, I think
that there should be a way to check whether equality is "mathematical"
or only heuristic.

By the way, are there any interesting computable coefficient fields
for rischNormalize?

Yes. In fact, I meanwhile think that it is not a problem, apart from
the fact that axiom lacks domains UnivariateExpression and
MultivariateExpression analogous to the polynomial domains.

So, does that mean that it doesn't matter what
sqrt(x)*sqrt(y)-sqrt(x*y) is, as long as it is consistent? I guess
there are two different cases, namely, one where we normalize with
respect to, say, x, i.e., y is a constant but x isn't, the other
casebeing when both x and y are constants.

Of course, Axiom doesn't have a domain for elementary
functions... Would it be difficult to implement such a domain?

What do you mean with "somewhat unstructured input"? I also do not
understand "I do not expect that the type of the argument alone can
guarantee computability". Computability of what? I'd guess that if the
argument type is computable, then rischNormalize should return a
normal form. Is this correct?

Do you mean that EXPR INT should store it's things rischNormalized? I
guess that this would make sense, however only if we keep the
unnormalized form as well, if it is "shorter". But I guess, I
misunderstood.

By the way, I stumbled over an old paper by Karl Aberer who presents a
normal form for expressions built using 1, 0, +, -, *, id and
composition. It may not be so surprising, but I think it might be
useful at some point. Furthermore, the procedure that normalizes is
absolutely simple. Notice the absence of division, though.

Is this possible?
