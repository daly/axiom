Hi Tim,

it seems that the links to "Online Book" and "Documentation" are
currently broken on http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/.

If you go onto the above site (this is probably not the site that one
would usually look for the documentation, I came there via google and
shortening the path) the link "Documentation leads to:

http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/axiom-website/documentation.html

which gives a 404 error.

Looks like a problem with relative links.
http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/ should probably not be
visible by itself.

The URL you are looking at has "axiom-website" repeated twice.

I grepped all of the axiom website. This does not occur.

Google seems broken. Go to axiom-developer.org and check the links.

The website

http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/

works fine for me; it is the page that is "home", I
suppose, starting with "What is Axiom".  Then clicking
"document" on the left frame is also fine.

http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/documentation.html

The 404 that you reported is wrong:

http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/axiom-website/documentation.html

because it repeated "axiom-website".

Maybe that is corrected already?

William,

Ralf walked down a directory, which should have worked anyway.
There was a missing CSS connection. I fixed it.
