Subject: Re: [sage-devel] Randomised testing against
	Mathematica

There are two test suites with validated results at
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/CATS/

The CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite) effort targets
the development of known-good answers that get run
against several systems. These "end result" suites test
large portions of the system. As they are tested against
published results they can be used by all systems.

The integration suite found several bugs in the published
results which are noted in the suite. It also found a bug
introduced by an improper patch to Axiom.

It would be generally useful if Sage developed known-good
test suites in other areas, say infinite sequences and series.
Perhaps such a suite would make a good GSOC effort with
several moderators from different systems.

I have done some more work toward a trigonometric test
suite. So far I have found that Mathematica and Maxima
tend to agree on branch cuts and Axiom and Maple tend
to agree on branch cuts. The choice is arbitrary but
it affects answers. I am having an internal debate about
whether to choose MMA/Maxima compatible answers just to
"regularize" the expected results users will see.

Standardized test suites give our users confidence that
we are generating known-good results for some (small)
range of expected inputs.

An academic-based effort (which Axiom is not) could
approach NIST for funding an effort to develop such
suites. NIST has a website (http://dlmf.nist.gov/)
Digital Library of Mathematical Functions. I proposed
developing Computer Algebra test suites for their
website but NIST does not fund independent open source
projects. Sage, however, could probably get continuous
funding to develop such suites which would benefit all
of the existing CAS efforts.

NSF might also be convinced since such test suites raise
the level of expected quality of answers without directly
competing against commercial efforts. I'd like to see a
CAS testing research lab that published standardized
answers to a lot of things we all end up debating, such
as branch cuts, sqrt-of-squares, foo^0, etc.

In my original email I had forgotten to mention that I had executed
both of these lines multiple times:

  echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
  echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield


However, I was using just make instead of

 make clean
 make NOISE=

when I used these, the build proceeded past the point where the error
was encountered with no problems.

Ted,

My guess is that something fails earlier.
Look backward for "[make]: *" which should be the error.

Subject: Testing if (72*a^3*b^5)^(1/2) is equivalent to
	6*a*b^2*(2*a*b)^(1/2)

I have been experimenting with Axiom to see how it compares to other
computer algebra systems.

One of the things I tried testing was if Axiom could determine if
(72*a^3*b^5)^(1/2) was equivalent to 6*a*b^2*(2*a*b)^(1/2):

(2) -> (72*a^3*b^5)^(1/2) - 6*a*b^2*(2*a*b)^(1/2)

         +------+
         |   3 5        2 +----+
 (2)  \|72a b   - 6a b \|2a b


When I entered this expression into Wolfram Alpha, it returned 0 as a result.

Is Axiom capable of determining if (72*a^3*b^5)^(1/2) is equivalent to
6*a*b^2*(2*a*b)^(1/2) ?

Thanks,

Ted

Every "number" has two square roots. The expression may be 
zero and may not be zero, depending on which of the four 
possible interpretations you put on the square root.

An expression like the one given can be interpreted at 
various levels in Axiom. Each "square root" can be 
interpreted as an algebraic element in an extension of the 
field Q(a,b) , where a, b are two algebraically 
independent element over the field of rational numbers Q 
(defined by a minimal polynomial) and the difference would 
be another algebraic element. Or, one can view a,b as 
standing for two elements in some ordered ring R, and the 
square root is always taken to be the positive square 
root, in which case, (a^2)^(1/2) = a in R only when a > 0 
in R.

There is also a difference (no pun intended) between 
testing x = y and testing x-y=0. If x = sqrt(72a^3b^5) and 
y = 6ab^2sqrt(2ab), then the minimal polynomials of x and 
of y over say Q(a,b) are the same and as algebraic 
elements over Q(a,b), x and y may be considered "equal". 
However, if I am not mistaken, x-y will be algebraic of 
degree 4 and not equal to 0.

It should be.  At least FriCAS is:

(1) -> (72*a^3*b^5)^(1/2) - 6*a*b^2*(2*a*b)^(1/2)

         +------+
         |   3 5        2 +----+
   (1)  \|72a b   - 6a b \|2a b
                                                    Type: Expression(Integer)
(2) -> normalize %

   (2)  0
                                                    Type: Expression(Integer)

Of course, you have to be careful interpreting this result, see

                Parallel Symbolic Computation 2010 (PASCO 2010)

                    July 21-23, 2010 -- Grenoble, France

                         http://pasco2010.imag.fr/

                          Second Announcement and

                       C A L L   f o r   P A P E R S

News:
  - PASCO 2010 Programming contest
  - PASCO 2010 in cooperation with ACM

Overview:

    The International Workshop on Parallel and Symbolic Computation (PASCO)
    is a series of workshops dedicated to the promotion and advancement of
    parallel algorithms and software in all areas of symbolic mathematical
    computation. The pervasive ubiquity of parallel architectures and
    memory hierarchy has led to  the emergence of a new quest for parallel
    mathematical algorithms and software capable of exploiting the various
    levels of parallelism: from hardware acceleration technologies (multi-
    core and multi-processor system on chip, GPGPU, FPGA) to cluster and
    global computing platforms. To  push up the limits of symbolic and
    algebraic computations, beyond the optimization of the application
    itself, the effective use of a large number of  resources  --memory
    and general or specialized computing units-- is expected to enhance
    the performance multi-criteria objectives: time, energy consumption,
    resource usage, reliability. In this context, the design and the
    implementation of mathematical algorithms with  provable and adaptive
    performances is a major challenge.

    Earlier meetings in the PASCO series include PASCO'94 (Linz, Austria),
    PASCO'97 (Maui, U.S.A.), PASCO'07 (London, Canada).
    PASCO 2010 is affiliated with the  2010 International Symposium on
    Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) in Munich, Germany.
    Immediately prior to the ISSAC 2010 meeting, PASCO will be held in
    Grenoble, France.

    The  workshop  PASCO 2010 will be a three-day event  including  invited
    presentations and tutorials, contributed research papers and posters,
    and a programming contest.
    Specific topics include, but are not limited to:
    * Design and analysis of parallel algorithms for computer algebra
    * Practical parallel implementation of symbolic or symbolic-numeric
      algorithms
    * High-performance software tools and libraries for computer algebra
    * Applications of high-performance computer algebra
    * Distributed data-structures for computer algebra
    * Hardware acceleration technologies (multi-cores, GPUs, FPGAs) applied
      to computer algebra
    * Cache complexity and cache-oblivious algorithms for computer algebra
    * Compile-time and run-time techniques for automating optimization and
      platform adaptation of computer algebra algorithms

Call for Papers:

    The  conference  invites submission of papers presenting original
    research, either in the form of extended abstracts (2 pages) or
    full papers (up to 10 pages) in ACM format. As in previous years,
    PASCO 2010 will publish formal proceedings of the accepted papers.

    The PASCO 2010 Conference proceedings will be published by the
    Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) http://www.acm.org/ and
    will be made available in the ACM Digital Library.

Programming Contest:

    A programming contest will be organized during the PASCO 2010 meeting.
    Each participating team will be competing on one or more programming
    challenges proposed by the organizing committee and by the participants.
    Details can be found at the PASCO 2010 web site.

[Apologies for possible multiple postings.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                        CALL FOR PAPERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  In co-operation with ACM SIGSAM, the International Workshop on

  Programming Languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems
  (PLMMS 2010)

  Part of CICM-2010, in CNAM, Paris, France; 8th of July 2010
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Important Dates
---------------

 * Abstract submission:        Fri 26 March 2010
 * Paper submission:           Fri 9 April 2010
 * Reviews sent to authors:    Mon 10 May 2010
 * Author's response deadline: Mon 17 May 2010
 * Notification of acceptance: Mon 24 May 2010
 * Camera ready copy due:      Mon 7 June 2010
 * Workshop:                   Thu 8 July 2010


Invited Speaker: Jacques Carette (McMaster University, Canada)


PLMMS Scope
-----------

The program committee welcomes submissions on programming language
issues related to all aspects of mechanised mathematics systems
(MMS). In particular:

 - Mathematical algorithms
 - Tactics and proof search
 - Proofs
 - Mathematical notation

Of particular interest are the dimensions of:

 - Expressiveness
 - Efficiency
 - Correctness
 - Understandability and Usability
 - Modularity and Extensibility
 - Design and implementation

Mechanised mathematics systems, whether stand-alone or embedded in
larger systems, include but are not limited to:

 - Dependent typed programming languages
 - Proof assistants
 - Computer algebra systems
 - Proof planning systems
 - Theorem proving systems
 - Theory formation systems

These issues have a very colourful history. Why are all the languages
of mainstream computer algebra systems untyped? (Not for lack of
trying: Axiom and Magma both enjoy type systems, although they have
not (yet) become mainstream.) Why are the (strongly typed) proof
assistants so much harder to use than a typical computer algebra
systems?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?  What forms
of dependent types may be used in mathematical modelling?  How can MMS
regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and "modularity"?
What are the biggest barriers when using more mainstream languages for
computer algebra systems, proof assistants or theorems provers?

Many programming language innovations appeared in either computer
algebra or proof systems first, before migrating into more mainstream
programming languages.  This workshop is an opportunity to present the
latest innovations in the design of MMS that may be relevant to future
programming languages, or conversely novel programming language
principles that improve upon the implementation and deployment of MMS.


Submission Details
------------------

Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library.

Papers should be submitted via the PLMMS 2010 easychair website:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2010

Submissions must describe original unpublished work which is not been
submitted for publication elsewhere. At least one author of each
accepted paper is expected to attend PLMMS 2010 and present her or his
paper. Papers should be no more than 8 pages in length and are to be
submitted in PDF format. They must conform to the ACM SIGPLAN style
guidelines using 9-point font size (see
http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm - this also
provides latex templates). Each submission must also adhere to
SIGPLAN's republication policy
(http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm). Papers will be
reviewed by at least three reviewers and the authors will have an
opportunity for rebuttal by the response deadline.

I have no idea what might be failing.
Did you set your PATH variable correctly?

cd axiom
export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
make clean
make NOISE=

(note that the `pwd` is using backquotes, not single-quotes)

If it still fails, send me the console log.

MathPiper (http://mathpiper.org) is the CAS which is used by GeoGebra
(http://geogebra.org) and GeoGebra was recently accepted as a Google
Summer of Code project.  The GeoGebra project has invited the
MathPiper project (which I lead) to participate in their GSoC effort
and I immediately thought that your idea of a CAS-neutral test suite
would be a good project candidate.

Would you be interested in helping to locate and mentor a GSoC student
to work on a CAS-neutral test suite which is based on the ideas you
discussed in the above email?

Yes.


A trigonometry test suite would be interesting. I'm a member of
the Numerical Mathematics Consortium
(http://www.nmconsortium.org/index.aspx)
and they recently published a technical specification for trig functions.
(http://math.mit.edu/~numericalmath/nmc/index.php/Technical_Specification)

If you look at Appendix A you can see the table of branch-cut choices.
Since this consortium also includes companies such as Maple it would be
a good place to devote some "system independent" effort. It is on my "todo"
list to make a test suite based on this standard so I'd be happy to help
guide a student, even if someone else is the public lead.

In particular, just developing a test suite that would highlight the
branch cut choices made by a variety of systems would be very valuable.
I know that MMA and Maxima tend to agree and Axiom and Maple tend to
agree but we both make different choices.

In addition, we could poll the NMC for students. There are people in
the consortium with wide-ranging contacts, like Inria, Maplesoft,
National Instruments, etc.




Alternatively I think a test suite of sequences and series might be useful.
Or contact William Kahan about numerical library standards (e.g. BLAS? 
ATLAS?)
that might need standards. Richard Fateman is also a good contact as he is
one of the Maxima authors and well versed in things like floating point 
formats.
Stephen Watt is also another source of potential standards. James Davenport
is a lead on the OpenMath standards committee and could suggest potential
cross-platform standards.

Note that there is also the HyperSpec for common lisp.

I did a tiny bit of work in that direction: look into
elemnum.input.pamphlet in fricas/src/input/.

http://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fricas/trunk/src/input/elemnum.input.pamphlet

This was done using the fricas testing framework, but I'm sure it won't
be difficult to translate to any other framework.

I talked with the GeoGebra developers and they very much liked the
idea of having one of their alloted GSoC student positions used for
working on a system independent CAS test suite (which MathPiper could
also use).  They were grateful that you agreed to participate in this
project as a mentor because of the exceptional amount of CAS
development experience you have.  GeoGebra has well over 100,000 users
and their website has around half a million visitors a month.
Therefore, they understand that a significant number of users will
benefit from this CAS test suite work. (As a side note, in the past
the GeoGebra developers have indicated that at some point in time they
will probably be interested in making a more capable open source CAS
than MathPiper available to their advanced users and I think Axiom
would be a good candidate for this).


Here is a link to the GeoGebra GSoC project idea page (the CAS test
suite project is listed at the bottom):

http://www.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/Gsoc2010


Here is a link to the GSoC website (which contains all of the
information about the GSoC program):

http://code.google.com/soc/


and here is a link to advice for mentors:

http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/AdviceforMentors


If you are still interested in being an official mentor for this
project, let me know and I will send you instructions which describe
how to apply as a mentor.


Here is the GSoC timeline:

http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/timeline


Since the addition of this CAS test suite project to the GeoGebra
project list was a last-minute occurrence, we are on a tight schedule
for locating potential students and inviting other potential mentors
and/or advisors to participate.  The student application period begins
March 9th and ends April 9th and so we do not have very much time to
locate potential students.  The student stipend for this project is
$5000.  Google defines a student as "an individual enrolled in or
accepted into an accredited institution including (but not necessarily
limited to) colleges, universities, masters programs, PhD programs and
undergraduate programs."


Since I do not have very much experience in CAS test suite
development, what I would like to see happen is for you to take the
technical lead position in this project and for me to serve as your
assistant.  Here are the kind of tasks I see myself doing in this
project:

- Handle most of the GSoC paperwork.
- Act as a coordinator for other CAS projects which may want to
participate in this project.
- Maintain a project website.
- Help with developing the code which will be needed to communicate
with a wide range of computer algebra systems.
- etc.



Here are some project areas I see you being responsible for:

- Determining the requirements and scope of the project.
- Using your contacts in the CAS community to locate potential
students for this project.
- Using your contacts in the CAS community to locate people who may be
interested in participating in this project as a mentor or an advisor.
- Identifying other CAS projects that may be interested in
participating in this project that I can contact.



Anyway, these are my current thoughts on the project.  Feel free to
modify them as you see fit.

               Parallel Symbolic Computation 2010 (PASCO 2010)

                   July 21-23, 2010 -- Grenoble, France

                        http://pasco2010.imag.fr/

                          Third Announcement and 

                      C A L L   f o r   P A P E R S

               *** Submission date extended to April 18 ***

Overview:

   The International Workshop on Parallel and Symbolic Computation (PASCO) 
   is a series of workshops dedicated to the promotion and advancement of
   parallel algorithms and software in all areas of symbolic mathematical 
   computation. The pervasive ubiquity of parallel architectures and 
   memory hierarchy has led to  the emergence of a new quest for parallel 
   mathematical algorithms and software capable of exploiting the various 
   levels of parallelism: from hardware acceleration technologies (multi-
   core and multi-processor system on chip, GPGPU, FPGA) to cluster and
   global computing platforms. To  push up the limits of symbolic and
   algebraic computations, beyond the optimization of the application
   itself, the effective use of a large number of  resources  --memory
   and general or specialized computing units-- is expected to enhance
   the performance multi-criteria objectives: time, energy consumption,
   resource usage, reliability. In this context, the design and the 
   implementation of mathematical algorithms with  provable and adaptive 
   performances is a major challenge.

   Earlier meetings in the PASCO series include PASCO'94 (Linz, Austria),
   PASCO'97 (Maui, U.S.A.), PASCO'07 (London, Canada).
   PASCO 2010 is affiliated with the  2010 International Symposium on 
   Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) in Munich, Germany.  
   Immediately prior to the ISSAC 2010 meeting, PASCO will be held in 
   Grenoble, France.

   The  workshop  PASCO 2010 will be a three-day event  including  invited
   presentations and tutorials, contributed research papers and posters,
   and a programming contest.
   Specific topics include, but are not limited to:
   * Design and analysis of parallel algorithms for computer algebra
   * Practical parallel implementation of symbolic or symbolic-numeric 
     algorithms
   * High-performance software tools and libraries for computer algebra
   * Applications of high-performance computer algebra
   * Distributed data-structures for computer algebra
   * Hardware acceleration technologies (multi-cores, GPUs, FPGAs) applied
     to computer algebra
   * Cache complexity and cache-oblivious algorithms for computer algebra
   * Compile-time and run-time techniques for automating optimization and
     platform adaptation of computer algebra algorithms

Call for Papers:

   The  conference  invites submission of papers presenting original 
   research, either in the form of extended abstracts (2 pages) or 
   full papers (up to 10 pages) in ACM format. As in previous years, 
   PASCO 2010 will publish formal proceedings of the accepted papers.
 
   The PASCO 2010 Conference proceedings will be published by the 
   Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) http://www.acm.org/ and
   will be made available in the ACM Digital Library.  The proceedings
   will also be distributed on CDs to the participants of the workshop.

Programming Contest:

   A programming contest will be organized during the PASCO 2010 meeting.
   Each participating team will be competing on one or more programming
   challenges proposed by the organizing committee and by the participants.
   Details can be found at the PASCO 2010 web site.

Subject: Axiom release - March 2010

Axiom has been released for March, 2010.

The source is at:
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html
as well as the Ubuntu binary. Other binaries are being built
and will be made available as they complete.

=======================================================================


March 2010 Release

This release concentrated on treeshaking more code into the Interpreter
volume. Support for )set break quit was added. Additional documentation
was added for branch cuts and clifford algebras. The first draft of a
new volume (10.5) on Numerics was added. An example of unicode was tested
to fulfill the long-term goal of unicode I/O support.

This release is an interim step in the process of merging the interpreter
source code into a single volume. Due to the size and complexity of the
task it will take several releases.

Three people were added to the credits list:
   John P. Fletcher <J.P.Fletcher@aston.ac.uk>
   Nathaniel Daly <nathaniel.daly@gmail.com
   Ted Kosan

The Axiom website was completely rewritten based on a new style css
provided by Nate. This change was also made to axiom-developer.com.

There is a new set option ")set break quit" per Ralf Hemmecke.
This will cause the interpreter to quit on failure. Documentation
was added to the books.
