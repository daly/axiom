I see. I had always thought that was the main axiom-developer page.

Since this is your personal page, it would be up to you to decide
whether to delete it or redirect it. But as far as the Axiom public is
concerned, it would be less confusing if the headers of those pages say
clearly it is your personal home page and that you provide links to the
"official" Wiki site. Then if someone stumbles onto your page through
searches, they would be directed to the right info place.

Non-historic and obsolete stuff should be deleted, even on your personal
page (IMHO).

At least he shows his picture with his big name prominent. So everyone
knows it is a personal web site.

Yes, but it should be clear it is a personal page.

There are two aspects: the portal main page is public and I don't mind
editing it. But the personal pages of its members are personal, and
better be left to the individual member who owns it. However, on the
main page, it should be clear what the purpose of the portal is, and why
each member owns a personal page. If I recall correctly, you mentioned
that very few members actually use the portal (that includes me, sorry).
I don't know why I would want to maintain my own portal page!

I will do what I can, once I learn what the purpose of the portal is.
But if editing involves more, like programming in zope or plone, then
I'm afraid I am not the right person.

I've built a debian box.
The default setup does not include latex or x11 support.
I eventually figured out that you need to do

  apt-get install latex
  apt-get install xlib-dev

and the command line reads:

  make AWK=nawk

The build is in process.

Most of the compile farm (non-linus) hosts offered by SF display
similar setting: either they don't have latex or they don't have svn.
I eventually gave up using them as testing platforms.

Axiom requires latex for build. If the environment does not have
latex, I cannot build Axiom, therefore I cannot test it on that
platform.

true. but i'd hope that configure would give a clue about what failed
and how to correct the problem.

i spent only 1 minute fixing the latex problem
but it took a good half-hour to figure out how to fix the X problems.
(of course, learning dselect took an hour but...)

can't configure on debian output messages like:

   Error: no latex.... try apt-get install latex
   Error: no X.h.... try apt-get install xlib-dev

there are a limited number of missing packages.

I realised that

make clean

does not remove

build-improvements/lsp/stamp-gcldir

Interestingly, looking at lsp/Makefile.pamphlet, it even seems that the 
target "clean" in the lsp directory is never called. It would fail since 
there is no ccl directory.

clean:
	@echo 17 cleaning ${LSP}/ccl
	@( cd ccl ; ${ENV} ${MAKE} clean )

On Debian of course the usual method of building Axom would be
from the Debian sources... :)

  apt-get source axiom

and the build-deps are also easy to satisfy.

I would be surprise to learn that latex was not available for
any computer system in use today. If latex is not installed,
then (usually) installing it is straight-forward. For example,
there are several different latex versions available for Windows
systems (miktex being perhap the most common free version).

Anyway, I do not see why the Axiom build should be designed to
require latex. The only really essential tool here is noweb.

Bill Page.

It does; configure.ac.pamphlet from build-improvements says:

   AC_CHECK_PROG([LATEX], [latex],
		 [latex], [AC_MSG_ERROR([Axiom needs a latex program.])])


However, my point was different: I cannot use the SF compile farm
hosts at the moment because basic Axiom requirements are nto met.

I don't think I want to fix the problems on the SF machines...

We also latex the document; that is part of the basic requirements --
we had a discussion on that issue last week or so with Tim.  If you
want to convince him, good luck.  Otherwise, I'll continue my work on
the sane machines I have access to.  If there are problems somewhere,
I'm very willing to fix them, but I decline to fix the build
environments.

Hello,

I just want to tell you that getting a fresh copy of patch-50 compiled 
fine on my Debian Sarge box.

BTW, this time I got a new copy of the tla archive, but would

make clean
tla update
./configure
make

be enough?

I am somehow missing a "distclean" target.
Or is the current "clean" target producing a directory content as it 
would be after a fresh checkout?

Ralf

And I'm missing a mostlyclean target -- so that I don't have to
rebuild some parts (e.g. gcl, bootstrap algebra, etc.)  over and over
again.

the current least surprising method I've found the hard way is just to
rm -rf the entire build directory.  Notice that by using the lndir
trick you can make the build directory different from the source
directory so that you can still keep the source in separate
directories.  Axiom golden and sylver don't support non-in-source
build (which is is a realy bummer), but I have a local experimental
copy of build-improvements where you use the standard practice of
building in a directory different from the source directory, without
the lndir trick.

> Axiom golden and sylver don't support non-in-source

they don't? the source tree is read-only (or is intended to be).

src is all of the original (human-generated) source.
int is a cache of (machine-independent, machine-generated) source
obj is a cache of (machine-dependent, machine-generated) binary
mnt is the ship system and should be the only thing needed to run

if you want the other directories to show up elsewhere just use
a symbolic link.

I do not recall that discussion. I do not agree that latex should be
part of the basic requirements. LaTeX plays no essential role in
compiling Axiom from source. Of course LaTeX (or an equivalent like
Lyx or TeXmacs etc.) would be a requirement if one intended to actually
modify the source since Axiom is coded in a literate style, but that
is another issue.

I thought the point of Silver was that we didn't have to try to
convince Tim of anything anymore ... ;)  (... meant to be funny).

Goood plan.

I think "fix" is too strong a word for the SF compile farm since
these machines serve many different purposes.

Bill Page.

It turns out that the recursive 'make clean' cannot recover from
certain badly formed partial builds. The actual clean stanza that
is now executed is in the top level Makefile and reads:

	@ echo 7 making a ${SYS} system, PART=${PART} SUBPART=${SUBPART}
	@ echo 8 Environment ${ENV}
	@ rm -f lsp/Makefile.dvi
	@ rm -f lsp/Makefile
	@ rm -rf lsp/gcl*
	@ rm -f noweb 
	@ rm -f trace
	@ rm -f Makefile.${SYS}
	@ rm -f Makefile.dvi
	@ rm -rf int
	@ rm -rf obj
	@ rm -rf mnt
	@ for i in `find . -name "*~"` ; do rm -f $$i ; done
	@ for i in `find src -name "Makefile"` ; do rm -f $$i ; done
	@ for i in `find src -name "Makefile.dvi"` ; do rm -f $$i ; done

This should reset the system back to its initial state.

I'll clean up the Makefile.pamphlets to reflect this.

cmpinclude.h is from GCL.
apparently the compile-file lisp call cannot find this include file.

did you build GCL or are you trying to use a pre-installed copy?

in some sense, yes. the SVN branch is a place where such "wild"
ideas (such as axiom without latex) can be explored. it's the
'Linux Torvolds' vs 'Andrew Morton' organization used in Linux
(not that i'm claiming to be linus...)

Andrew maintains a -mm version of Linux that includes many 
patches/changes/extensions/breakage that is not accepted into
the mainline distribution if/until Linus is convinced. some
ideas (such as the kernel debugger) never get included in the
main distribution (see http://kwn.net/2000/0914/a/lt-debugger.php3)

i can see from his post that Linus is a 'primitivist' like myself :-)

latex does not need to be globally installed.

No, they don't.  I just repeated this for illustration.  Try it on
your machine.

  % cd src/axiom.trunk-tla
  % tla update
  [...]
  % cd ~/build/
  % mkdir trunk-tla
  % ~/src/axiom.trunk-tla/configure --prefix=$HOME
  Linux


  ===================================================
  You must set your AXIOM and PATH variables. Type:

  To build the rest of the system type:

  export AXIOM=/home/gdr/build/mnt/linux
  export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
  make

  configure finished.

  % export AXIOM=/home/gdr/build/mnt/linux
  % export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
  % make
  make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.


| the source tree is read-only (or is intended to be).

That is the _intent_, but NOT the actual reality.
Compare with this

% cd build
% mkdir b-i && cd b-i
% /media/usbdisk_2/cas/axiom/2006-08-30.b-i/configure --prefix=$HOME
[...]
% make
AXIOM=/home/gdr/build/b-i/mnt/linux; export AXIOM; PATH=/home/gdr/build/b-i/mnt/linux/bin:${PATH}; make do-all

[... so on...]

The sources live in a different place and the build happens
elsewhere.  The objects for the build, host and target are separated.

| src is all of the original (human-generated) source.
| int is a cache of (machine-independent, machine-generated) source
| obj is a cache of (machine-dependent, machine-generated) binary
| mnt is the ship system and should be the only thing needed to run

I understand that division but it is setting up a very non-standard build
process that does not even match the intents.

| if you want the other directories to show up elsewhere just use
| a symbolic link.

A simple symbolic link does NOT work.  You have to do something
equivalent to the lndir trick I documented. 

Axiom would gain lot by not building a ghetto around itself.

See

  http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00571.html


The executive summary is a bug (I believe) in the option GCL uses to
compile the generated C codes.  GCL should include the patch to cmpinclude.h

A fix for Axiom would be to have GCL include that path evertime, for
example by modifying *CC* -- by I have not tested that yet.

So, for the moment I have successful builds with

   ./configure --without-gcl

I should probably make that default -- but it kinds of negates the
whole purpose of the patch.  If I don't have time to fix the GCL issue
today, I'll make --without-gcl the default.

I did not build GCL by hand, of course. Just said

./configure
make

But I have an seemingly old gcl installed.

Use (help) to get some basic information on how to use GCL.

How do I find out whether Axiom has built gcl or not?
At least the config.log says

configure:3030: checking for gcl
configure:3046: found /usr/bin/gcl

And this is 2.6.6. Hmmmm....

I do not have enough patience to wait the long time needed to lookup
mails from the axiom-developer archive, it was mostly a ping-pong
between Tim and me on the list.

I do believe that there out to be a mode of compiling Axiom without
having to latex the pamphlet files, because there are situations where
those latexing are pure plain waste of valuable time.

well, when I asked for machines where I could test Axiom on, you kindly
reminded me that SF offers compile farm machines.  I find the idea great!
Then I proceeded to registered myself and test Axiom.  Only to find
that Axiom build requirements are met only on linux-based platforms. 
If we restrict ourselves sufficiently enough we should not have any
problem.  We could even build a wonderful black-hole ghetto for Axiom.  

Now, if I must spend valuable time to install tools on each of those
systems and watchout for my user configuration files to pick the right
binaries and whatnot, then I rather spend it on my research and teaching.
Axiom requirements are excellent in the abstract.  Its approach to the
real software world makes it a good candidate for the contest of most
frustrating open source software to contribute to.

You have also to realize that it is good to provide people way to test
wild ideas and provide incentive to people.  Can you give me any
reason why people would spend their valuable time Axiom-without-latex
when it is for from the outset that it is wasted time?

No, at the moment it is not.  Rather, I'm beginning to view it as way
of trapping people :-)

that is beside the point.

To build axiom on 2.6.6 you need to set the GCLVERSION variable.
The required patches are in the zips subdirectory and will 
automatically be picked up.

Unfortunately you'll have to reach into the tla archives to pick up
gcl-2.6.6.tgz

Axiom will certainly not build on a pre-installed GCL version 2.6.6

As of today, when you say that, Axiom will look the build environment
to see whether GCL is present and try to use it.

I should probably put a version cut of on it -- say GCL 2.6.7.

But, even with that, there is a bug in GCL that needs to be fixed:
currently it does not seemt to the set the -I include directory switch
so that GCC can find its internal include file.

I'll try to work around that by modifying *CC*.

[...]

| How do I find out whether Axiom has built gcl or not?

Normaly, the message output by configure on the standard output should
tell you that Axiom will use the installed GCL.  You should have seen
something like

    checking for gcl... gcl

Say 

  ./configure --without-gcl

to force Axiom to build its own copy of GCL.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't this be simply addressed by
having a ./configure --nobuild-latex option in the build improvements
branch, with the reasonable expectation that this option becomes
"mainstream" when the build-improvements branch does?  The default can
be to build the LaTeX files, but a quick check for functionality
outside of the latex system can also be done for those who aren't
testing the latex build ability at that time.

I understand the desire to make literate programming part of the
process and I agree with that goal, but in cases like the sourceforge
compile farm I can certainly see checking the non-latex parts of the
build on those platforms.  We aren't in the business (so far as I know)
of testing latex functionality on different platforms - we assume if
people want latex built they have latex available, just like gcl
assumes a working gcc available.  If people don't have latex available
and can't install it, then I can see a minimalist build option. 
Editing the files in pamphlet style doesn't mean you need to check that
the latex part works then and there - if the code part and the notangle
part work there then latex can be debugged later on a machine/platform
where it does exist.

In the very long term, something like an improved cl-typesetting might
enable us to actually remove the need for a working TeX installation as
a requirement for creating the literate files, but since we can't
currently provide our own solution and a serious LaTeX installation is
sometimes a lot to assume I would favor making the LaTeX build a
configure time option.  The default should still be to build it, but I
would support giving the user the choice to disable it because there
are circumstances (the SF compile farm being a good example) where
there is a valid reason not to use it.

Cheers,
CY

I don't think there is a desire to restrict where Axiom builds -
this is only due to allocation of the scarce resource of people
motivated to solve problems on other platforms.

Understood. I would prefer to reduce the requirements (e.g. remove
the requirement for latex).

I agree. How can we fix that?

The compilation of the build-improvements succeeded with

./configure --without-gcl
make

After that I said

export AXIOM=/my/path/to/mnt/linux
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
axiom

After the welcome message I read

(1) ->

and hyperdoc flashes up and dies.

Interestingly, I don't see that share directory under 
build-improvements. The file could be found here.

Interesting, I did not make any work in that directory.  
I suspect there must be an issue related to this reported in the axiom
tracker, but for a different Axiom flavour (not build-improvements).

\begin{rant}

We part company on this one.
I guess I'm alone in understanding that the Latex IS THE SOURCE.

Latex is not optional, it is not overhead, it is not waste.
If latex is not installed then axiom SHOULD NOT BUILD.

If you just want a system without source code that's fine.
But that has nothing much to do with the design and testing of
the axiom configure/make process.

I get the distinct impression that no-one has really made the
transition to literate programming. 

Do you write the documentation before and during program development 
or are you coding and then "adding the documentation"? 

Do you always notangle or do you write code and embed it later?

Are you writing for the end user and future developers
or are you programming and then explaining?

Do you create the .dvi file and xdvi it on every change
or do you call gcc/lisp directly and only look at the .dvi later?

Do you rewrite paragraphs so they flow easier, have index entries,
and are placed where they logically belong in the explanation or
do you write paragraphs around where the compiler wants the code?
(hint: if your code is in compiler order in the file you are most
likely NOT doing literate programming. Humans don't understand
design issues in compiler order)



Literate programming has almost nothing to do with latex.
It is a change in MINDSET and a change in development methodology.



Few people have had the opportunity to get their own code returned
to them after 15 years. Believe me, your "deep understanding" of
the makefiles, algebra code, etc. will be lost on you when you are
asked to explain or maintain it 15 years from now.

Code that you need to explain (and which you are no longer around
to explain) is DEAD CODE. Code written for the machine rather than
people is DEAD CODE. Don't believe me? Show me code you wrote 15
years ago that is still used and maintained by others.

Since we are only in the first 50 years of computer science and
most code dies when the company kills it or the company dies we
have not had the issue of creating live code. LIVE CODE is code
that will survive many GENERATIONS of programmers. Few examples
exist because most code dies.

Axiom cannot afford to add more dead code. It will not survive.
Open source will NOT do it. I've already had one of my open
source projects die (pinger, an SNMP client/server in Java), 
even sourceforge removed it.



After much pondering on the subject I believe that literate
programming is the only technology that promises to make code live.
It can do that because it changes the MINDSET so that programmers
write for PEOPLE, not machines.



The new makefiles should be 3/4 documentation. They should discuss
the design decisions (like separate build trees) based on today's
understanding so that when the trends change (and they will) the
next generation knows the why and how of the design. Why is it ok
to require the user to install GCL but not Latex? Why is it important
to have automatically generated makefiles? Why is it important to
use automake? How is non-linux portability addressed? What linux
assumptions are made so I know what to change for BSD? What about
getting it to run on a MAC? Windows?

We SHOULD be reading the literate makefiles like you would
peer-review a paper. That way we could correct design mistakes
and debate wording of explanations that affect code.

Unreasonable? Hardly. I've gotten a fair amount of grief over the
design of the current Makefile tree. I've been told that it is
unclear (even though the first paragraph of the top level Makefile
starts explaining the design points). I've been told it is not
'standard' even though it preceeds automake by 10 years. I've been
told that it doesn't support 'standard stanzas' (like distclean,
whatever that does). I've been told that it should use special
GNU-make features (whereas it used to use standard make and used
to build on Suns which it won't do now). I've been told that it
is a complete mess even though it follows a very small number of
design principles everywhere (stanza per file, makefile per 
subdirectory, unique echo per stanza, $SRC/$INT/$OBJ/$MNT variables,
etc.

Believe me, you're going to catch grief from the next person to
touch the makefile process. At least explain why the new process
does what it does so that you can point out where changes go against
design principles (such as the src/int/obj/mnt principles).



Above all, please try to make the transition to a literate mindset,
at least while working on Axiom code. The future demands it.

The logical consequence is that Axiom would probably stay in its black
hole ghetto and you continue ranting alone here wondering why nobody
recognizes the value of Axiom, and why you have so few people
contributing to Axiom.  The 30-years horizons might just be 30-years
night.

I strongly suspect you get a VERY WRONG impression.

The question is not whether we understand the value of literate
programming.  The issue is more about how we leverage on existing
tools to bring literate programming mainstream.  Until you appreciate
that that you can NOT take over the world overnight, you will
unknowingly be harming Axiom.

[...]

How true!  Now get down, and concrete.  Axiom requires latex to
build.  That requirement should be losened until you take over the
world.  Latex isn't needed for running and testing Axiom.  Refusing to
build Axiom on a system where latex does not exist is not just
non-sensical.  It does active harm to the project itself.

Nobody has proposed that Axiom be non-literate -- if that is what
you're arguing.

No, that cannot be. ;-)

Since fixes in Gold should appear *BEFORE* in Silver, that fix cannot be 
in Gold, since it is not in Silver.

If it is in Gold, then someone is hiding the good stuff from people 
working on the Silver branch.

Tim, you should not just add improvements without telling others. That 
makes frustrated developers who will soon get away from Axiom or fork a 
new project. Do you want that?

I must say, I don't understand that. If you type "make" that will build 
the whole system. Why cannot there be some targets like "make binaries", 
"make doc" to split that process?

Suppose you are an axiom-developer (and you can build everything of 
Axiom on your local machine). Now person A is posting a message that 
Axiom does not build on machine X for this or that reason. Let's say the 
reason is that the binaries don't compile. You have access to a similar 
machine X' and you have the feeling that you could solve the problem.
You checkout Axiom on X' start compilation and... the compilation stops 
just after trying to latex the first Makefile.pamphlet, because 
unfortunately, LaTeX is not installed on that machine and you don't have 
root access to install it.

In any case it simply would cost you too much time to look for a bugfix 
and so you just say

rm -rf $AXIOMTREE

and don't even post on axiom-developer that you had tried to solve the 
issue.

A build system that builds parts of Axiom with fewer requirements (like 
building binaries and no .dvi files) is just a PLUS for Axiom. That has 
NOTHING to do with Tim's wish that Axiom should not (fully) build if 
LaTeX is not available. It's just support for Axiom developers.

I also think so. Tim, it was basically you and all that Axiom stuff that 
made me try LP. And although I think I've understood the change in 
mindset, I must admit that it is not completely trivial to change my 
previous way of programming to an LP style. You can see that from all my 
code in ALLPROSE and aldor-combinat 
svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk/combinat
But I will never go back to non-LP.

Ralf

If we take that approach, then it is just as important to bundle TeX in
some form along with Axiom as it is to bundle GCL.  Particularly on
Windows, where an installation of TeX probably does not already exist.

That may be true, in some sense - if you mean going from "making a
document that describes a design and then integrating the code into
that design" to writing a document which happens to have some passages
in source code.  I liken it to writing a document containing both
English and Ancient Egyptian - if you don't speak Ancient Egyptian
fluently, you're going to wind up either writing out the Egyptian and
then going back and writing the English paper (because they require
different types of concentration) or writing the English paper and then
creating the Ancient Egyptian to support what you need  (the latter
approach is the one I am planning for the units package).  Obviously it
is iterative for both languages but eventually you arrive at something
reasonable.

I think, Tim, you are capable of writing fluently in both English and
programming languages - in both cases they are merely ways in which you
"speak" your ideas.  To me at least it is not (yet) this natural - if
I'm translating an idea into code I have to stop and figure out how to
do it, with a lot of trial and error.  I can't do that and write at the
same time, as yet - for me it is two different kinds of concentration.
 
> Do you write the documentation before and during program development 
> or are you coding and then "adding the documentation"? 

The former, more or less, although I will likely change both code and
document significantly before this process is done.  If I hit a sticky
point of coding that requires an hour of banging my head into new
shapes I don't bother writing latex until I can say something
intelligent.  This may be because I am not a skilled coder - when it
comes more "naturally" to me perhaps I will become better at the "write
a document some of which happens to be in the Aldor language" style of
working.

> Do you always notangle or do you write code and embed it later?

The latter, or as I build a document I will notangle it to get the
support structure, and then fool around with the next piece until it
makes sense, then go back and embed it to have it become part of the
"support" structure and main document.

> Are you writing for the end user and future developers
> or are you programming and then explaining?

Hopefully the two are not mutually exclusive.  I am in the somewhat
precarious position of trying to write a high quality literate program
without having at the beginning of the process either the academic
knowledge or the programming knowledge to achieve the goal at the
outset.  Ralf and William have both been an immeasurable help in
improving that situation, but many of the issues I have to figure out
are due to my not yet being "fluent" in the subjects of Aldor, Axiom,
and units/dimensions/types.  It would be like including someone
learning English for the first time in a document attempting to do a
literary review of a book - you want the review to be about the book,
not about the author of the review learning how to write the review.

Heh - I guess since my pamphlet file is so far all latex code it's a
bit of a moot point.  On the Emacs mode pamphlet, it was sort of a mix.

That part I do understand.  I order the ideas for humans and then put
things in the correct order at the end.

I agree.  That methodology, however, requires a fluency level in
programming which will require some time for me to achieve.

:-).  Oh, no question there.  But before I consider myself qualified to
write a document about a program, I want to have something that works. 
If I don't have running code for an idea I will usually describe the
idea, and then grab the programming tools and beat my head against it
until something works.  THEN I (might) be qualified to start talking
about the how and why of making the idea into a coded algorithm.  

I may change some of this once I am comfortable enough to do "real
work" in Aldor.

I wasn't programming 15 years ago, but I agree this is true.

Definitely agree.  We have reinvented so many wheels so many times it

OK.  I don't want to hammer too hard on this point Tim, but for things
like the lisp and boot code in the interperter I think there is already
so little understanding of that code that the changes required to make
it run on ANSI, documented or not, are going to do very little to
change the "live" status of that code in a literate sense.  Your work
on bookvol5 is what WILL change it, and eventually a re-write which
cleans up and makes known the issues involved with the interperter
design, but the practical benefits of ANSI compatible changes are
mostly orthogonal to the goal of a comprehensible literate interperter.
 Obviously the BEST idea is to make the interperter into a literate
program, but my one run at that pretty much convinced me that we should
just start at an ideas level, design what the interperter SHOULD be,
and then use the existing code where applicable as either a guide or
copied over to create the new interperter.  Since that task is down the
road on the current plan, I would like to see a minimal ANSI compatible
subset change made (with or without comments, since the codebase is
already too dense for many of us to understand at the moment anyway and
thus we don't DECREASE comprehensibility any) to allow us to make use
of tools being created for Lisp today.  

I understand this doesn't advance the goal of making Axiom truly
literate and so may be counter to the goals of the project, I'm just
presenting (as well as I can) the argument for a few short term, quick,
and immediate steps to improve immediate problems like being able to
run only on GCL, which doesn't support things like McCLIM, cffi, Slime
(maybe?), and other tools used by most modern lisp programmers today. 
If they are not convincing then that's OK too.

But we don't require the user to install GCL - Axiom deliberately
includes it in the tree as of now.  We DO require an external install
of LaTeX - is the plan to bundle some subset of TeX and LaTeX as well? 
(I can see this if we have a cl-typesetting type solution since that
typesetting logic can also be used in GUI situations as well as
literate coding, but I don't think TeX was designed for this type of
situation.)

OK.  But for those of us who are not qualified to comment on issues
related to those particular questions (which are quite non-trivial as I
understand it, but that's about all I know about it) how much
background should be documented in Axiom?  The idea of building
software itself from human readable languages into binaries?  The
reasons for platform differences?  The issues of compiling expressions
to Ultrasparc vs AMD64 binary code, and the consequences of the design
differences?

Personally, I think those types of questions (indeed most related to
building code) should be documented at a system-wide level as literate
programs (literate autoconf and automake) rather than be the
responsibility of Axiom.  I find this an attractive idea (which is why
things like the literate lisp implementation and things like
Movitz/CADR lisp machine code interest me) but personally I think there
has to be a point beyond which Axiom shouldn't have to go because Axiom
is a CAS, not an operating system.  I don't know for sure what the line
is, but (for example) I would rather leave the extremely messy issues
of building on different platforms to the autoconf/automake experts. 
Would it be nice of autoconf and automake were literate programs,
describing all the issues and how to deal with them?  Yes.  Is this
Axiom's responsibility?  I don't know.

Standards are themselves a moving target, (hopefully) improved by
increasing knowledge and skill on the part of the people creating them.

It is extremely unfortunate that these platform specific issues are
there to cause us trouble.  I think the idea of autoconf and automake
is to isolate programs from the lower level cross-platform issues, and
instead allow the program to focus on writing their own code, but I
confess I don't know enough about it to know for sure.  Gaby?

That's reasonable.

I have been and am, but I make one final observation:

"To write literature with a language one must first be fluent in it."

Fluency in programming languages, like human languages, takes time and
practice.  Perhaps I should not be attempting any serious Axiom work
until I first achieve fluency.

CY

Hi everyone,

I know that probably I am the person of least programming experience
in the list, but I felt like commenting on this issue.

Axiom should only provide the packages that are "must have" and that the
user cannot install in their system by themselves. I do not think you
should convert your make process into a package manager.

If a special version of GCL is required for Axiom, then it should be
provided.
But if it falls under the criteria of Noweb, Latex, X, etc, ... that the
user can
install by themselves, then GCL and every other package should be also a
dependency. If their are not present then AXIOM is not compiled and the
error is shown to the user telling them what is needed.

Then you move to another level of providing packages for the different
distros
(at least the mayor ones) and use their respective package managers to
handle
the dependencies (yum, apt-get, emerge, pacman, (insert your favorite here).

ummm, the patch was posted to the list and i applied it.
it is hardly a secret fix.
see CHANGELOG item 20060814


i was working on the todo-list posted in the --patch-50 announce which read:

      update CVS on sourceforge
      update CVS on savannah
      diff -Naur Gold Silver and post patches
      ....

of which i've completed the first two and was working on the third
when the news arrived that --patch-50 fails on debian. so i balr'd
off ot build a debian box to debug the problem. debian had some
default setup issues (latex, xdev) which i had to solve. now debian
build stops in the algebra compile and i'm trying to debug the problem
as we speak. 

the plan is to diff Gold and Silver.... soon.

it's a holiday weekend here in the states which means i get an
extra day of axiom hacking.

But that is the wrong order. Silver should have the patches before.
As I said I strongly believe that Silver trunk SHOULD be ALWAYS in sync 
with what you have in your tla archive.

Otherwise you are developing silver and the svn/trunk is gold.

BTW, when will there be the next official release of Gold. I haven't 
heard of any Axiom release recently. Or are you saying that --patch-50 
was a Gold-release? To be honest, I am still completely confused about 
all that. Am I alone?

Anyway, when Gold is released there should not be need to move patches 
from Gold to Silver/trunk. If that must happen then I think something is 
wrong.

Honestly? No. I did not check very carefully, but it seems 
all you did was adding a front page as your personal web 
page (which is good). But anyone reaching, say the page 
for Axiom portal (link given on the new page) would still 
be led to obsolete info like the Download link there. This 
is because as far as other users are concerned, these link 
are external to your personal page, and can be accessed 
either via your provided link or through say Google 
search.

I would suggest that we (you?) do a Google search on 
Axiom, and remove or update those pages (especially those 
on the top in the search results) if they are under our 
(your) control. The fewer past/obsolete pages appearing in 
the Google search results, the better (or if they do 
appear, users will have to use a cached copy, indicating 
possibly out-of-date material, and the direct link 
provided by Google should fail).

If you set me up to be able to edit or delete pages no 
longer needed, I'll spend some time to clean things up.

William

Here is where the change in MINDSET kicks in. 

The source code is [latex vs gcc] and someone posts a bug in a
program. You try to build the program and it fails in the [noweb-latex
vs gcc compile] step so you give up. Or you argue that you could take
the intermediate code [spad/lisp vs AST-RTL] and debug with that. (GCC
can generate intermediate files of abstract syntax trees (AST) or
register transfer language (RTL) which are system-independent.)
You can certainly build/debug with that.

So if [noweb-latex vs gcc] is not installed you give up?
You don't need root access to install latex. It's just a program.
Latex can be installed locally with no problems. (perhaps we should
consider including it in zips :-) (joke, joke, ok?))

The point I'm trying to make is that not have latex is like not
having GCC. Axiom compiles code on the fly so you must have GCC.
If your development platform did not include GCC you can't build 
Axiom.

The second point is that just because something is technically
possible it is not a requirement that we support it. You CAN run
the final RTL-machine stage of GCC without running anything else
but nobody expects you to build from RTL.



It is perfectly reasonable to have a -nosource option. Many people
don't care about the source.

But not having source is just using a binary. It's not a build
environment.




It is not reasonable to build on a non-latex machine because in the
near future (assuming I have a creative burst that gets me over the
hump) we should be able to just drag-and-drop sources onto our 
browser-based hyperdoc. The whole process will fail without latex.
Future plans require it. Systems without latex will be like systems
without X11. Many useful features of Axiom won't be supported.

If a developer in a source forest gives up does the CVS tree hear it?

Ummm, I can take your argument further. Bill really wants us to work
on APT-GET installed programs like noweb (and latex). Suppose a
developer does not have root access. Can they APT-GET noweb? If not,
they could build a system version directly from the INT subdirectory
since this does not require the SRC subdirectory, latex, or noweb.

However we don't ship INT (which, if we did, would seriously speed
up the build process since it caches a lot of work). This elides
both the noweb and latex requirements. Is this a plus?




> But I will never go back to non-LP.

It would be hard for me to make the case that you are not
doing literate programming :-). 

I was trying to make the point that for any programmer it is as
hard to change to literate programming in a proper way as it is
to change to functional programming, parallel programming,
object-oriented programming or any other major sub-genre. 

True object-oriented programming uses strict message passing
(ala Smalltalk) and it is hard to learn. Using C++ to write
C programs is not object-oriented programming. From my point
of view using non-latex builds is extracting the post-C++
C code in order to compile. You still dress the king but
only in underwear. :-)




If build speed is the ONLY issue then just don't 'rm' anything.
There is NO reason to rebuild the system from scratch or make clean.
In theory you can change anything in the source tree, type
'make' and it SHOULD do the right thing. Otherwise make is broken.
One of the current design principles is that this should 'just work'.

My original plan -- as I tried to communicate to Tim last week -- was
pricesely that we should make the process modula so that we have the
kind you subdivision you are proposing even if "make" just ends up
doing the whole.  I have seen *successful lagre projects* (much larger
and complex than Axiom) work that way.  Axiom is painting itself in a

Autoconf and Automake are now "standard" tools that insulate software
developers from lots of platform variabilities.  Tim claims he has
been told many things; as far as I'm concerned, those "things" were
most of the time backed with facts.

In April, I approched two friends of mine involved in linu
distributions (RH and SUSE) hoping to have them make Axiom part of
their distribution.  They said they won't touch this stuff if it does
not support cross-compilation.  We have two choices: ignore them, and
improve Axiom so that it becomes easy to build, therefore easier to
dsitrbute.  I suspect the later choice can only be beneficial to the
project.  That is why I set up to improve the build process.
Using Autoconf for example, it is a very simple matter to resolve the
X11 issue -- because people have hitted that problem many times and
Autoconf solved it once for all.  However, I've gotten the distinct
feeling that Axiom likes to build its own ghetto and solve problems
with known solution its own way.

Yesterday, I've gotten a student who is very exceited about what I
said about Axiom and he would like to work on provisos for example.
But, I'm very hesitant to launch him on the Axiom sources, because it
would take him inordinate amount of wasted time -- on distracting
build issue -- just to get to a point where he could be productive.

i refer you to prior emails... 

point 1 is that until recently i did not have a working svn client and
could not patch silver. thus, i didn't.

point 2 is that silver was intended as a testing ground for ideas
whereas gold is a place where official system builds reside.

point 3 is that i don't have the time to maintain silver with the
very latest patches in any reliable way. unseen behind the gold
curtain is that a lot of testing occurs for each patch on many
systems so it 'just works'. this testing occurs in batches every
two months or so. i can't apply silver patches and not test them
and i don't have the time to test them as they are posted.

point 4 is that bug fixes don't necessarily change anything interesting
in the 'mission' of silver which is to allow developers a place to make
major system changes in public.

point 5 is that i promised to bring silver up-to-date as of this
gold release and then apply patches there at the same time as i
apply patches to my local copy of gold, regardless of breakage.
thus silver will appear to lead the official gold releases in 
the future.

gold (--patch-50) went out on 8/29. look in the email archives for a
subject of '--patch-50' or look at the CHANGELOG in the root of the
axiom--main--1--patch-50 for a list of changes.

each --patch-NN level is a 'gold release' and they are supposed to
occur at 2 month intervals (see the email archives) since 2 months
is short enough to wait for an official fix but long enough that
i don't spend all my time testing.

True.  But is latex *really* required to install and run axiom.  The
answer is no.  Are all people' times best spent in installing latex on
all machines when the real issue is to test for *axiom*
functionnalities?  You have to ask yourself how you can best benefit
from people's limited time.

If you believe that latex is required for Axiom, I must delcare that
you have not understood literate programming.  And I'm not joking;

Please explain what you mean by cross-compilation.

You can NFS mount SRC, set the AXIOM variable for the current system,
type 'make' and it will cross-compile. We've been able to do this 
since 1985 or so. I used it to build on Suns, Symbolics, AIX, and
several other systems on a daily basis. If you also NFS mount INT
you can used the cached work on a cross-platform build.

What does that mean?

Yes. Because from the description of the build failure posted I had some
feeling what is going wrong. But I cannot reproduce it. Since my build
doesn't come to that point.

I don't even have "intermediate code".

I really don't understand why you insist on preventing people from
contributing to Axiom. It is all community work. If someone understands
what is going on and posts a fix. That is much quicker than having to
wait for someone how has the right environment, understands the problem,
is able to fix it. Note that I could even post a patch that fixes a
problem without having latex on machine X'. Note that I have
(deliberately) included a phrase in parentheses in my first sentence
above. I either do it on my local machine and testing the latex build
there and the binary build on X'. Then I could send a fully documented
patch and everyone would be happy. No?

And even if I submit a patch that does contain a latex error. The guy
who posted the problem could check the binary build and fix the latex
stuff and post a correction patch. That is distributed development! You
need not have just one person knowledgable in everything.

I fully understand that for the enduser you want latex, noweb and
everything, but what does that have to do with developers doing
distributed development to produce proper pamphlets?

Of course, I could install it. But why should I invest my precious time
with installng LaTeX (or anything else) if it is actually not needed for
what I am trying to achieve.

Really? If I write a paper, I don't care whether gcc is installed. LaTeX
is what counts. It all depends on what I want to achieve.

There are simply different use cases for Axiom. Some people USE
mathematical theorems but are unable to prove them or even to invent new
ones. What you are saying is: I consider those people not as my target
audience for application of mathematics.

Right. But if I don't have latex and change a pamphlet, I am lost.

Wasn't there someone who said that --patch-50 does not build on debian?

There was. I'm debugging it now.

I have RH7.2, RH9, FC4, FC5, Ubuntu, FreeBSD (not working yet), MAC OSX
(not working yet), XP2 (partial), Red Flag Linux, Knoppix and Doyen running 
on various machines.  I've tried to build a SUSE machine and a Solaris x86
machine without success so far. I've tested Axiom on the working machines.

I just built a new Debian machine to extend testing to that platform
which has not been a problem in the past. Future releases will be tested.

It should 'just work' but I keep finding new 'features' in new versions
of operating systems that require me to extend my local compile farm
(thus extending the effort to create gold). For instance, FC5 broke the
X portion of the system. Renaud pointed this out to me in July at ISSAC
so I built an FC5 system to test it. (A motherboard failure (since fixed)
delayed the release of gold).

I can't claim that it does 'just work' but I do try hard to make it so.

Benjamin Kosnik tried to explain that in April on this list.
Imagine I'm running on x86-based machine, and I must build binaries
for a PowerPC-based systems.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-compiling
http://www.airs.com/ian/configure/configure_5.html

and if you want an example of what I'm talking about

http://www.mozilla.org/build/cross-compiling.html

| You can NFS mount SRC, set the AXIOM variable for the current system,

Sorry to say, but that is way, far way insufficient to provide
cross-compilation. Furthermore, as I demonstrated earlier, the current
scheme just does NOT work.  I've tried it!

if we allow build of Axiom without requiring latex, Axiom might be in

everybody is trying hard.  You have to admit that if you open the door
for more testing, you might have more hands to help you.  Maybe you

Next time before you release gold, just make an announcement. Then 
people (like me for example) could download silver/trunk (which should 
be the upcoming release) and test it. That way some burden of testing is 
released from you and nobody on the axiom-developer mailing list could 
say after the gold release that it doesn't build on his system.

What about that suggestion? Or do you really want to test everything 
alone and wait for complaints after the release?

If we restrict ourselves sufficiently enough, we would find that 
Earth is flat -- we just have to check our office or bedroom.

It is a fundamental mistake to believe that people can or have the
right install things; and even if they technically can, they would do
so.  Axiom should minimize that dependency.

LaTeX is not fundamental to build Axiom.  
Similarly, Axiom needs not run under X11.
Axiom needs GCL and a working C compiler. Those are different stories.
You can expect a C compiler from the build environment.
GCL you can't expect, so it makes sense to put a copy of it in Axiom
-- though ideally, we would like not to.

Someone, peopel seems to interpret allowing Axiom to be built if latex
is not present as making Axiom non-literate.  I highly suspect that is
a religiously mis-representation of what literate programming is.
Furthermore, we have to face the reality and ask ourselves what we can
do to gradually make Axiom a computing platform of choice.  I don't
believe we will get there by being rigid about the build environment.
The minimum requirements should not include latex nor X.

Three days ago, I had my copy of Mathematica and sadly look over the
bill.  Yet, I'm happy with the product (and very unhappy about what it
costs).  The reason being that I can have students' limited time best
spent there.  I certainly don't want them get swamped in rigid
approach to literate programming, when they have valuable contribution
to make.  I must confess that, however enthusiastic I'm about Axiom.

I don't think people ask you to maintain silver -- that is why I

I believe this discussion started because I suggested using the 
sourceforge compile farm for testing. You eventually replied that
since the sourceforge farm didn't supply latex on certain platforms
you were not going to test them. But you can install latex.

I want testing, especially for the build mechanism.

Ralf, Gaby,

Are these reasonable statements?

Axiom source code is available on 3 platforms. All posted patches have
been applied. On my private server many users have personal userids;
22 people have read/write access to the Arch repository. There are
over half-a-dozen 'private' arch branches created for users, Camm has
a private userid for assisting Axiom/GCL testing, I set up the initial
SVN repository and gave Gaby Administrator access to do anything he
wants on the sourceforge site.  I've done many off-list handholding
efforts for people who are starting with the system. I've encouraged
major changes like using ALLPROSE everywhere. I've helped with private
development of Aldor. Six people have admin access on savannah (Me,
David, Camm, Juergen, Bill, and Dylan) and three people have admin access
on sourceforge (Me, Bill, Gaby). All have the right and ability to
change Axiom any way they want. In all nearly 30 people can completely
rewrite the system, including the golden sources.

In what way are people being prevented from contributing?

Axiom used to build directly from non-latex sources. These sources
still exist in Arch and CVS. There are more Axiom users now than
there were prior to the latex builds. There is nothing to prevent
you from creating a non-latex SVN branch that uses these sources.

So far only the Debian default system does not include Latex.
Latex can be built for a single user. In what way does using
latex cause the world to turn away?



I admit to having strongly religious views of the way I believe Axiom
should be built but that doesn't mean you have to agree.  It doesn't
mean you can't change things. In fact I encourage you to try.  If you
really believe latex is a blocking condition then build the system
without it.  This is, after all, open source and there is nothing

As I said earlier, I do want to do the testing -- I don't think I've
proposed anything amounting to do merge on silver without testing on
enough platforms.  I've called for help for testing earlier.

I just don't want to go and install "random" tools on all the SF

a different platform my PATH pick the right binaries.

Ralf,

I just got SVN access 2 weeks ago. 
Until that time I was unable to change silver.

To some extent, they reflect the frustration grown out of what I see
as unreasonable rigid requirements.  I apologize if you feel bad about
it, but they reflect some reality and I would encourage you to take
them into account.

[...]

I suspect that what we are saying is that, instead of telling users grab
yet that another branch somewhere else, make the mainstream ones
sufficiently "accessible" in the sense that they don't require too
much dependencies.  Those are not unreasonable statements.

I may not have looked sufficiently, but I was not under the impression
that we have so much reousrce that we can afford unfocused branches
multiplied ad infinitum, and wasted efforts.

| There are more Axiom users now than

I suspect that is the part you don't want to aapreciate.  I'm not
interested in working on any branch on something that is not
mainline.  And I certainly don't have the desire to spend time on
a branch of Axiom when I do know from the outset that it is wasted
time.  So the question: is there sufficient value in allwoing Axiom to
build in an environment lacking latex.  The answer is yes.  You say no
with the emphasis that if latex is missing then the build must fail.
When, you hold that view so strongly, how do you really believe you
encourage people to make contributions to Axiom?  Apparently, I have
machines I can help testing Axiom functionalities if Axiom is allowed
to build if latex is missing.

| So far only the Debian default system does not include Latex.

the SF compile farm hosts where latex is missing are not just debian
systems.  Please check.

| Latex can be built for a single user. In what way does using
| latex cause the world to turn away?

It does prevent people from effectively testing Axiom, when in
fact latex is not necessary to test Axiom's functionnalities.

| I admit to having strongly religious views of the way I believe Axiom

Good!  The question is whether you guarantee NOT to give the work
consideration.

X-List-Received-Date: Sat, 02 Sep 2006 02:51:03 -0000

If I may, I have a couple questions/observations:

1)  If there is functionality developed in a branch, what are the
mechanisms for deciding if this functionality will become part of the
"main" branch?  This is not clear currently.

2)  One view of having large numbers of divergent branches is that it
splits project resources across many uncoordinated efforts, diluting
the effect each branch can achieve - the "many-branches" development
model is a lot like forking, which open source has an adversion too
except under extreme circumstances (like XFree86 vs. X.org).  The
reason for this is simple - development in isolation increases the risk
that a significant development effort will result in work that is not
accepted by the large community as part of the "official" distribution,
and dilutes effort which could have made the original project better. 
Marketing dictates that users, with understandably limited attention
spans, will not wish to expend the effort to understand many similar
forks of software.  When competiting for that attention, focus is
critical.  How do many individual divergent branches impact the user
perception of Axiom as a focused product likely to deliver results?

3)  If we are going to require TeX/LaTeX as a core component, what is
the minimal subset of (say) TeTeX and MikTeX that will provide us with
the functionality we need to create pamphlet file builds?  We include
GCL because it prevents issues with GCL as a separate program, and now
the evidence suggests that this procedure might also be needed if LaTeX
is never to be an issue on any platform.

I understand the desire to have full functionality with minimal
requirements from the system - on Windows it is almost essential.  But
with automake/autoconf we should be able to have our cake and eat it
too.  If the only way to resolve this is to have either an
external-latex or internal-latex build option and build whatever subset
of TeX is actually required for Axiom, how difficult would that be to
achieve?

A good open source project always requires some compromise, so if I may
let me suggest we see if there is some solution that can be found which
lets us move forward.  As I understand it:

a)  One side of this argument is that any build options which encourage
the use of non-literate programming styles of development should be
discouraged in order to promote the usage of literate programming as a
style.

b)  Another side is that minimal testing of machine-program
functionality on systems without LaTeX is a valid check on the
portability of Axiom to the new platform.

What about this?  If we accept that LaTeX is an indespensible part of
the build process, we treat it like GCL and provide enough of TeX and
LaTeX internally to produce what we need.  However, we also create a
config option which will check only the machine level code, including
the building of TeX itself.  (If TeX doesn't build on a platform this
will be held a bug Axiom must deal with, the same as a GCL bug.)  This
will accomidate work styles different from that of the fully literate
program writer (which is a rare breed both in terms of training and the
skill level needed), and ultimately any patches submitted back to Axiom
(from whatever source) must be quality vetted by the core team anyway
in order to ensure the standards have been met.  The default settings
will not neglect the LaTeX build - a developer would have to
specifically seak out a way to not build the LaTeX based components of
the system.  Similar to the "--without-X" option in some software - you
don't go looking for it unless there is a reason you want it.  We can
argue about whether there SHOULD be a reason to want it, but the tool
is there for those who want to use it.  Coversion to literate
programming is a gradual process, I think, and making it smoother/more
gradual for those new to it is most likely a good idea - in the end,
those who might have given up early can be eased onto the hook ;-)

The drawback, of course, is that this would be one more bundled package
in Axiom.  However, the autoconf work should make this ultimately an
optional choice - download only Axiom and try to build using only
externals (GCL, LaTeX) or download a much larger system that requires
only the most rudimentary bootstrapping binaries conceivable.  There
are two philosophies at work here, and I would rather see both
accomidated to some degree and allow us to keep our coherence as a
project.  But that's just me.

Cheers,
CY

Well, after much discussion with a friend....

Are you all concerned that the new makefile won't get into gold?
Because I have philosophical problems with the idea of non-latex builds?
Have I ever said that I wouldn't accept it? 
Have I even said it's up to me?

It appears that the src/algebra/Makefile fails.
This Makefile is dynamically created by the findAlgebraFiles script.

The awk script attached to the BOOTSTRAP routine in findAlgebraFiles
does not created the required .lsp files.

The script reads:

egrep '<<.*BOOTSTRAP>>=' *.spad.pamphlet | sort | uniq | \
awk -F: '{
  chunk=substr($2,3,length($2)-5);
  split(chunk,part," ");
  lspfile="\${MID}/"part[1];
  print lspfile": \${IN}/"$1;
  print "\t@\${TANGLE} -R\""chunk"\" \${IN}/"$1">"lspfile;
  print "";
}'


Does anyone see anything in this script that might fail on debian
systems but work on other linux systems?

I don''t really understand, what you mean here. In Makefile.pamphlet I 
read in section

\subsection{Write the Makefile stanzas for the bootstrap files}

the following text:

Finally we output two lines:
\begin{verbatim}
${MID}/vector.spad.pamphlet: ${IN}/vector.spad.pamphlet
	${TANGLE} -R"VECTOR.lsp BOOTSTRAP" ${IN}/vector.spad.pamphlet 
 >${MID}/VECTOR.lsp
\end{verbatim}

So findAlgebraFiles does NOT write any .lsp file. It writes Makefile 
stanzas to stdout. If you want .lsp files you must say

make ${MID}/vector.lsp

BTW. If you carefully compare the generated lines in the Makefile and 
the above verbatim text then you realize that the target is something like

${MID}/vector.lsp

and not

${MID}/vector.spad.pamphlet

so the script does better than the documentation.

I found it.

On most lisp systems the egrep/awk script creates stanzas that look like:

${MID}/ABELGRP.lsp: ${IN}/catdef.spad.pamphlet
	@${TANGLE} -R"ABELGRP.lsp BOOTSTRAP" ${IN}/catdef.spad.pamphlet>${MID}/ABELGRP.lsp


but on Debian the lines look like:

\${MID}/ABELGRP.lsp: \${IN}/catdef.spad.pamphlet
	@\${TANGLE} -R"ABELGRP.lsp BOOTSTRAP" \${IN}/catdef.spad.pamphlet>\${MID}/ABELGRP.lsp


It looks like debian's awk uses a different convention of escape characters.
I'll have to write a special case version for debian in the morning.

Hi Tim,

Interesting. The two lines from my src/algebra/Makefile look like

${MID}/VECTOR.lsp: ${IN}/vector.spad.pamphlet
	@${TANGLE} -R"VECTOR.lsp BOOTSTRAP" 
${IN}/vector.spad.pamphlet>${MID}/VECTOR.lsp

No \ there.

I am using debian.

awk --version
GNU Awk 3.1.4

But I also heard that there is some issue with \ in awk.

Ralf

You are the one who decides what goes into gold.  When you say

In April 2006, I think Ralf asked similar question and I tried to
answer as best as I could.  From my perspective, a functionnality
developed on a branch needs to 

   1) be well-tested,
   2) have a well-documented patch (e.g. following the accepted
      programming methodogy),
   3) be reviewed by the "core" developers, (e.g. Tim), for acceptance
      or rejection.

I would like to comment; it's more correct to change this option to something like
X Window System Version 7.0.0
I believe that this x11 version moved the lib, thus a compile test like
Xorg -version
is more in line with reality than selecting fedora5.  All of the other distributions (and perhaps
individuals upgrading) will (or should) track this.  IMHO things like this have to be folded in, in
a systematic manner; this type of change is not going away.

I keep hoping for stability but it's not happening.

Alfredo,
	Oh, please please; what good is "literate programing" if nobody understands what is said.  Known
error outs should automatically tell the user (typically inexperienced) what to do.

I would argue the contrary, that this doesn't always happen. Windows systems
are the best example. What in the world do I do if I get a window saying:

"unknown error".
"error: c456cpetht..."
"the system has recovered from a serious error"

That doesn't have to do anything with LP. And type of error messages like
this are written by world top programmers.

My point was that I see now two camps in the mailing list. I could be a
regular user of Axiom, so my hope will be always to just say "apt-get
install axiom" or any other package manager. If I am trying to compile it
and I am missing something, then this should be clear. Who has not spent
time trying to figure out some dependency because it was not clear what
broke at compilation time. (maybe only me, nooby :-) ).

In a perfect world Axiom would not have any dependency, but if it must have
it then let the
user install it in the system. How hard is to have latex on a system
nowdays. I am with Tim in this, regarding that future projects will require
latex (browser hyperdoc...). Axiom is  in LP style, Latex/Noweb is the
current tool in Axiom to achieve this, how can Latex not be a requirement?

I understand that it makes it harder for the testing purposes on other
systems, but I think is not that much of a problem as it sounds in this
thread. Of course I could be totally wrong, with everybody more experienced
than me actually doing the work (easy to talk in the bench) .

I hope that was the problem you were talking about, and not my English.
Sorry if I am not clear in my writting (I have only 4 years living in US.
Funny enough 4 years ago I was not able to ask for coffee in a restaurant,
much less think that I would be able to write suggestions for such a  great
project like Axiom).

I have no idea, and that was the point I was trying to make.

There are some people that would argue that, but I won't go there:)

yes

It must unless we are going to reinvent the universe; the point is to make it clear and explicit.

It's a challenge, but one that must be met for wide usage; at least until "The Operating System"is
finally developed.

Absolutely nothing to do with you or your writing; I was just making a plea for know errors to give
guidance about how to fix things.

Enjoy, it's 63 in Maine, that's the high.  The New England weather forecast a couple of weeks ago:
prepare for early frost; after all, summer is almost 2/3 over.

Here is a concrete proposal for you:  get subscribed at SF (if you're

and do the testings on all of those hosts, send the build log back to me.

Gaby,

 I knew this part was going to be taken in another context, and by no means
 I tried to underestimate the work you are doing. Plus, I do recall your
email
 explaining that you did not want waste time testing on systems, when you
 could focus on your research or teaching.

Here is a concrete proposal for you:  get subscribed at SF (if you're
> not already) and install latex on all the non-linux systems they have
> and do the testings on all of those hosts, send the build log back to me.


  I guess your point with this assignment is to show me how difficult it is.
By no
  means I wanted to say this was trivial. But if that helps with the great
work you are
  doing, I would be more than glad. But I am curious, couldn't be latex be
avoided for
  testing purposes, and then have it as a requirement later on??? (do latex
to build the
  documentation).

   But again what do I know. But if you read the thread again it looked like
developers
   clashing over ideas, which is normal until it gets to point similar to
Matthew Garrett
   resignation from Debian.

   I apologize if my comment was wrongly interpreted.

   Regards,

   Jose Alfredo Perez

(Some "if"s, I know.)
If being built refers to being built by people who might make changes
(others will eventually use pre-built binaries, I would guess) and if
part of literate programming is being able to produce nice typeset
documentation, wouldn't building without typesetting encourage
literate bit-rot?

What is it, then?

I think you misread what I said. I do not want to waste my time
"fixing" build environments -- I for sure know how to find my way
through, I just don't believe it is a good use of my time.  Fixing
Axiom is already a full-time job.  I *do want to do the testing* -- or
accept help from others to do the testing.  Testing is important.

[...]

Not really.  I just do not buy the stance "it is not difficult to
install X Y tool on systems, _therefore_ people should do it and by the
way we are not going to make it easy for people to contribute the
little they can."

That is essentially what I have been saying since the begining.  We
are not in the business of testing latex on all pltaforms.  We are
primarily interested in testing Axiom.  Consequently, I believe we
should make it possible to allow people to test Axiom on system
lacking latex.  I don't see how that harms Axiom.

Jay,

  Why don't you register at SF and fix the build environment so that
you can report on testings if you believe that Axiom should not be
allowed in build environement without latex?  That way we can
meaningfully reject any help amounting to test Axiom in an environment
without latex.

I am registered at SF; I'm belanger there.

I don't know what that would involve, but I'd be happy to look into
it.

I don't have any beliefs in the matter.  I was asking what I thought
was an important question which I didn't see addressed in this thread.

  Gaby,

  Why don't you register at SF and fix the build environment so that
> you can report on testings if you believe that Axiom should not be
> allowed in build environement without latex?  That way we can
> meaningfully reject any help amounting to test Axiom in an environment
> without latex.


  I think what Jay is trying to say is that regular users will use binaries
or
  PM to install axiom. However the case you are referring is to people who
  would like to contribute, but shouldnt any code to be contributed to
  Axiom be in LP form also? I know this is not the standard, but I think
  that would be the final goal? How can this be accomplished without Latex?

   However, I think a compromise could be to have something like
--without-latex
   (extreme case), but knowing that documentation, and other possible future
features
   will not be available. I am sure you have already said this on this
thread.

    Regards,

    Jose Alfredo Perez

Gaby, in order to stop the whole debate... You've heard Tim. He is not 
preventing people to do anything good or bad. What I understood this 
morning was that when Tim speaks of Axiom he refers to the gold release.
If you (and I) think that it is good for Axiom to modify the Makefiles 
that (a part of) Axiom builds even if latex is not present, then we are 
allowed to do that. Tim might not want it moved into gold, but even if 
these modified Makefiles stay in silver, it would speed up the build 
process and allow other people testing at least a part of Axiom.

I think the simplest way would be to ask configure to generate a 
variable LATEX that expands to 'latex' if LaTeX is installed on the 
system and no "--without-latex" switch is given or it expands to 'echo'.

Then in each place where latex is used it should read ${LATEX}.
These are the only files that refer to latex as a command.

Hi Tim,

Do these lines help you?

 >echo Hello | awk '{print "\${MID}"}'
awk: warning: escape sequence `\$' treated as plain `$'
${MID}

 >echo Hello | awk '{print "${MID}"}'
${MID}

Unfortunately I have no idea whether $ should be escaped or not. I was 
unable to find an appropriate line in the gawk info pages.

Ralf

I suspect people are simplifying too much here.  I don't believe the
world divides so nicely into mutually exclusive  "regular users" and
"contributors"; and regular users will have binaries or PM to install
axiom.  I know of reasonable people who hate PM (with the automatic
dependency hell that comes with it).  So positing the above would make
a lot of sense only if we restrict our world sufficiently enough.

testing, testing, testing, I said.
Not contributing unbuilt or untested patches.

Building Axiom can be done without latex.

Latex is required only to "type check" the pamphlet files.  If you see
someone contruting something without having latexed it, please arrest him.
And if you look carefully you would arrest many of the key contributors.

Again, I'M NOT PROPOSING TO ACCEPT CHANGES TO PAMPHLET FILES THAT
HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY LATEXED.

Now, do you believe that we have enough resources and testers on
all platforms we want to support, so that we should refuse building
Axiom without latex?  That is NOT a rhetorical question.

-- Gaby

| Gaby, in order to stop the whole debate... You've heard Tim. He is not
| preventing people to do anything good or bad. What I understood this
| morning was that when Tim speaks of Axiom he refers to the gold release.
| If you (and I) think that it is good for Axiom to modify the Makefiles
| that (a part of) Axiom builds even if latex is not present, then we are
| allowed to do that. Tim might not want it moved into gold, but even if
| these modified Makefiles stay in silver, it would speed up the build
| process and allow other people testing at least a part of Axiom.
|
| I think the simplest way would be to ask configure to generate a
| variable LATEX that expands to 'latex' if LaTeX is installed on the
| system and no "--without-latex" switch is given or it expands to 'echo'.

that is indeed one way to do it.

| Then in each place where latex is used it should read ${LATEX}.
| These are the only files that refer to latex as a command.
|
| src/interp/bookvol5.pamphlet
| src/doc/Makefile.pamphlet
| src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet
| src/script/document

document does many things, including latexing input files.  And it is
used at many places.

I would like to divide the make rules so that we have "make dvi" that
does the latexing, separated from the rest.  Of course, for releases
"make all" will compile codes and "make dvi".

Hello,

In the page http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources, it is
written : "the stable release is avaiblable either via a direct source
tarball or via access to CVS or TLA archives. You find more details at
AxiomGoldBranch" but where is/are the source tarball(s)? It could be a
good idea to allow user to download a source tarball either from
SourceForge or savannah, they offer this type of service (from
wiki.axiom-developer is a good idea too).

Greg

Every attempt I make to check out the silver branch fails with
svn: Can't open file '...random file name...'

There appears to be no way to recover and continue.
Each failure complains that axiom/trunk/axiom is locked.
svn cleanup axiom fails

Is anyone able to check out the silver branch?

Upon receiving your mail, I tested

  % svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk/axiom axiom.silver

It just finished with

   A    axiom.silver/lsp/ChangeLog
   Checked out revision 113.

I believe there was a discussion yesterday about awk and escapes
involving $, \ and debian.  While working on the makefiles for
something unrelated, I happen to notice that on a non-debian system I
have the following warnings 

  awk: cmd. line:3: warning: escape sequence `\$' treated as plain `$'

and so on.  So, if you fix this; make sure you don't fix it "just" for
debian.

I think anyone who suggests that Axiom should/could be built
this way does not understand how lisp works. What sense does
it make to try to do a lisp save-system to some other hardware
platform?

Or do I misunderstand what you mean?

For data points, Emacs is lisp-based and can be cross-compiled.  Maybe
Stallman and friends don't understand how lisp works, however they made
Emacs cross-compilable.  But, since that is from the real world, it
probably does not count.

Properly distinguish build, host and target specific tools and files.
Make sure that, for example, when GCL tries to compile a function,
it invokes the adequate C compiler; that GCL is itself compiled with
the adequate C compiler etc.

| Or do I misunderstand what you mean?

I don't know; however, you're most certainly welcome to explain why you
believe people suggesting cross-compilation of Axiom don't know how
lisp works.

How can we separate that?

Please, explain carefully why you believe that people suggesting
cross-compilation of Axiom don't know what how lisp works.  Once
you've given your justifications, we should be able to work out where
the confusions are.

I don't know who doesn't know what doesn't work. I just
asked how can this be done with gcl?

The issue is not who doesn't know, but why you believe that anyone
suggesting cross-compilation of Axiom does not know how lisp works, as
you suggested in earlier message.  That would help clarify confusions.

| I just asked how can this be done with gcl?

There are numerous poins to work out; and I've listed the most obvious
that immediately came to my mind.

The idea is to be able to use platform A to build Axiom, or minimal part
of it, so that the built Axiom can run on platform B.

Most distributors work that way, because they usually have faster
build machines.  Again, refer to Benjamin Kosnik's message from April
2006.

Sorry, I did not intend to offend anyone. All I meant was I do not
believe that cross-pile is possible using a lisp like GCL. And it
is unclear to me how this can be done with any lisp - but you say
emacs lisp is cross-compiled and I believe you. But I don't see
how that can help the cross-compile issue with Axiom.

In fact, so far your replies have been distinctly unhelpful... :(

I don't see how any of these points apply to gcl. gcl is based
on gcc. That is a "adequate C compiler" isn't it?

I have no idea how that would be possible except perhaps through
some virtual machine technology - but then that is not really
cross-compilation is it?

I can not find any reference by Benjamin Kosnik to lisp in the
axiom-developer archive. I did find however David Mentre's
explanation of why cross-compilation might be difficult/impossible
for Axiom.

You don't have to believe me.  The source code is out there and you
can walk yourself through it and see how it is done.

Emacs was offered a data point of a lisp-base system that can be
cross-compiled, in response to your original statement.

First you have to make sure that core GCL is compiled with a C
compiler targetting the host.  Next, you have to make sure that GCL
uses the host C compiler for its internal purposes.  Furthermore, you
have to make sure that the rest of GCL (that really needs to run on
the host) is compiled in a host-like enrivonment.  Notice here that
you have a "seed" that is cross-compiled so that further compilation
can be done.   This is basically the way Emacs is compiled.

Again, read carefuuly what I wrote.  What I wrote is an explanation of
the way most distributors work.  Not to a mention to a specific lisp.

Now, if you hold it is impossible to cross-compile Axiom; then, that
is fine.  Let's move to another topic, and come back when I've
finished my work on cross-compilation.  Let's not just tell people
that they don't understand how lisp work.

Gaby, just for my own information:

Is this issue similar to (say) compiling CMUCL or SBCL for a new
platform, working from a current one?

I always understood cross-compiliation to be the production of a binary
for a platform that does not currently have any existing binary, using
a running binary on a second system.  This means, in general, that the
software on the second system must understand how to write a valid
binary for the first, and also that the software itself not depend
explicitly on behavior not exhibited by the second system.  

More specificly, does distribution cross-compilation imply that for
some machine types/targets, the target machine type is never actually
used to build any software - instead, an existing machine of a
different type is used to create the binaries for the targeted arch? 
And unless a distribution can compile binaries for machines completely
different from the one the software is actually being built on, then
they can't distribute a particular package (the logic being it is too
much work to have N machines for N archs, some of which might be
substantually less powerful than the build machines?)

I would have thought if GCL was able to do this then Axiom probably
would be able to too, give or take the non-lisp parts of the system -
am I missing something?  Or is GCL in fact not able to be distributed
for similar reasons?  I would be interested to know how Maxima fairs in
this situation.

Cheers, and thanks again for all your hard work.

CY,

Axiom was ported to the Zaurus handheld using cross-compilation.
Camm does it in the Debian setup.

There are two methods generally used, CROSS-COMPILATION and
CROSS-MOUNTING. 



CROSS-COMPILATION involves two systems, B -- the build system and
T -- the target system. You compile on B but tell GCC that the
target is T. 

GCC is designed in layers. The source code eventually gets compiled to
RTL (Register Transfer Language) which is a target independent
lisp-like assembler language. Since this is system-independent you
can use the RTL anywhere.

The final stage of GCC compiles RTL to the target platform. GCC
currently targets about 20 platforms.  This is useful for targets like
the Zaurus (an ARM (i386-ish) processor) that do not have the
horsepower to be a compile platform. It is also useful for embedded
systems.




CROSS-MOUNTING is easier if the target system has the tools and horsepower
to host GCC. For instance, to build on a Sun system it is easier to use
NFS (Network File System). Here we talk about S -- the source system
and T -- the target system.

On S, which contains the source tree, you 'export' the filesystem using
NFS. This allows anyone to mount the filesystem remotely. On T you 
NFS-mount the sources. They now appear to be on the target system
and you can just type 'make'

Axiom can use this system. First you build on S so that you have a 
full build tree (SRC, INT, OBJ, MNT). Notice that these are defined as

  SRC -- Human created, read-only
  INT -- Machine-generated, Machine-independent
  OBJ -- Machine-generated, Machine-dependent
  MNT -- Final distribution tree


SRC contains the source tree. NFS export on B it so it can be mounted on T.
INT contains a 'cache' of extracted code that is system-independent so it
also can be NFS exported on B and NFS-mounted on T. This saves having to
redo a lot of work.

On B you export SRC & INT.
On T you NFS-mount SRC & INT.
On T you set the AXIOM variable to the local machine 
  (e.g. export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/sun)
On T you type 'make' and it builds a Sun version.

In parallel, other systems can also do NFS-mount and make.
The only change is the AXIOM variable (e.g. `pwd`/mnt/macox)





The advantage of CROSS-COMPILATION is that you can build for systems
that don't support a build environment. The disadvantage is that you
need a cross-compiled environment (e.g. libraries need to be cross
compiled, .h files need to reflect the target, etc.). Since Axiom
needs the X11 libraries for a full build you need to have X11
libraries that are cross-compiled for the target (e.g. Zaurus)


The advantage of CROSS-MOUNTING is that you are building on the 
final target and can use all of the libraries, includes, and tools.
The disadvantage is that you can't do this if the target does not
have the horsepower.


Which method you use is determined by the resources of the target.

No, I don't think that is true. At least I know it isn't true
for the version of Axiom that I run on my Zaurus. Axiom is built
on Debian like all other packages that I know of on Debian - on
a machine that is hardware-compatible with the target.

http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi

I think the binary that I use on my Zaurus was compiled on Debian
running on such an Arm host. (Camm can confirm.)

http://www.debian.org/ports/arm

These machines have the same type of processor as the Zaurus
(although of course these are probably not handheld devices :)
having faster processors, more memory and faster mass storage.

In order to run Axiom, I must also configure my Zaurus to run
a similar Debian distribution. On my Zaurus the arm Debian
distribution runs in a chroot.

In fact I have built Axiom from source on my Zaurus, but I do not
recommend it. Since there is not enough main memory you must
configure a swap disk and swapping to SD ram is *slow*. It took
about two days to complete.

Perhaps it is possible to cross-compile programs written in C to
arm using gcc. For example, here is an ambitious project of that
type:

http://scratchbox.org/wiki/Crocodile

But I am quite sure that this is *not* how Camm compiles Axiom for
Arm and the other Debian architectures.

Tim, that sounds like nonsense. Anyone can mount source directories
located on another machine running another operating system. You can
use NFS, or Samba or whatever. This has nothing to do with cross-
compilation.

Maybe this strategy was interesting once-upon-a-time but with
the machines that we have available today I doubt that there is
much advantage to this. It seems to me that all you might save
is the BOOT-to-Lisp and SPAD-to-Lisp compile times. The only code
in Axiom that is (approximately) machine independent is the lisp
source code and the generated lisp code. To get anywhere else
with that you still need a lisp interpreter/compiler on the target
environment. And it seems to me that that is the hard part.

The version of Zaurus that I have (which still runs the Sharp
supplied embedded Linux) does not support X11 natively. That is
one reason why you need the Debian arm port. There may be a
version of OpenZaurus Linux that does have X11.

But I still do not understand how you can talk about cross-
compilation and GCL. When GCL compiles some lisp source code
it produces intermediate C code which, yes could in principle
be compiled for another architecture, but then it immediately
attempts to link the generated object code into the running
GCL image. If you are attempting cross-compilation this is
not possible because the running GCL image is not compatible
with the object code produced by gcc.

What am I missing?

As far as I can see, this is irrelevant to the issue of cross-
compilation.

>=20

If you build the binaries on the target this is not cross-
compilation.

With regards to cross-compilation and Maxima see for example:

I believe you're confusing "cross-compiling GCL" and "building a
GCL cross-compiler".  In my Axiom work, I'm interested in the former.

Bill,

I was giving a tutorial on the difference between two different
obscure techniques that could be used to get Axiom running on a new
system. I'm not advocating either technique.




> > Axiom was ported to the Zaurus handheld using cross-compilation.

You're right. I'm wrong.





> There are two methods generally used, CROSS-COMPILATION and
> CROSS-MOUNTING. 
>
> I have never heard of "cross-mounting" used in this context.

Cross-mounting was the primary way to build axiom. A Zaurus
handheld contains more processor speed and memory than the 
systems we used to use. Storing the SRC and INT directories
on the target machine would cause them to run out of disk space.

ummm, that's why I put it in a separate paragraph named CROSS-MOUNTING.
yes, it has nothing to do with CROSS-COMPILATION.




> Maybe this strategy was interesting once-upon-a-time but with

Quite true. Which is why I now copy the sources to the target machine.

I'm pointing out that historically Axiom built on many target
systems which had the speed of your toaster and the disk space of
your credit card using this technique. It explains why Axiom is
structured the way it is. A full, from-scratch Axiom build used
to take 3 weeks. Two days on a Zaurus would have been a miracle.

Not much that I can see. Yes, you could build a cross-compiled
image of Axiom and you could set the system so it does not try
to compile things but you couldn't use it for algebra development
without a lot of hand-manipulation (e.g. running the debugsys
image in which everything is interpreted, hand-loading the
interpreted form of the compiled algebra, etc).

I'm at a loss about why the cross-compilation issue was raised.

Historically it wasn't. On systems with 10 gig hard drives
and 4 Meg of memory (a VERY big system then) you didn't need
to do this. But on systems with 10 meg hard drives and 640k
of memory it was a challenge.

The compilers did not include a cross-compile target so it
was not possible to build on anything but the target systems.

Now it's completely worthless, as you point out.

ummm, again, I don't believe I said it was....
I was just giving a tutorial about the two techniques.
I don't recommend either one.

Distributors have environments set up so that they can cross-compile
programs to targets.  You can wonder why they do this, but that is the
way they do it.

Cross-compiling Axiom here, does not mean that the Axiom compilers or
interpreter is itself a cross-compiler (to get there, you would have
compiled Axiom as a Canadian cross which is pointless in this specific
case).  The cross-compiled tools or programs just act natively when
run on the host.  I suspect that is the part Bill is confused about.

Sourceforge SVN trunk/axiom is up to date with the Gold version

There are 390 changes. 

Apparently the automatic conversion from CVS to SVN is broken
with respect to binary files. They have been fixed.

In the trunk/axiom directory there is a directory called PATCH49-50
that contains a file called PATCHES which lists all of the commands
used to make the changes. It also contains *.patch files which are
the diff -Naur changes to each file.

In essence, it is similar.

I never looked at SBCL before you mentioned it in this thread.
I briefly browsed their website and the description of their build
process.  They claim cross-compilation of SBCL is straghtforward

      http://www.sbcl.org/porting.html

I rest my case.  (Or maybe they don't know how Lisp works :-)

I don't think you are missing anything.  I don't believe the current
build of GCL can be subjbect to cross-compilation -- from reading its
makefile.

For the type of work I'm doing, we don't need the Axiom compiler as a
cross-compiler -- it would remain native.  We want it to be
cross-compiled.

I don't know; Camm may have more answers here.
It certainly does not come with the linux version I use.

maxima does not come with the distro I used -- I don't know for RH.
But, isn't Maxima capable of using a lisp implementation other than GCL?

You're welcoome.  Thanks!

Perhaps it is just me but SVN is very frustrating to use.
It gets itself into this 'locked' state and cannot escape.
The only method I've found so far is to completely rm the whole tree
and fetch it fresh. 
  svn cleanup . 
is a worthless command.

Am I the only one with this problem?

OK, I give up with SVN.

Apparently all of the effort I put into the system yesterday and last
night is broken.

I copied correct versions of the jpg files (which were broken).
I marked several hundred files as 'binary', including these jpg files.
I committed all of the changes.
The commit succeeded.

Due to a lock problem here I removed all of the svn directory.
Then I did an svn checkout to re-fetch the tree.
It appears that the work I did was lost even though the commit succeeded.
For example, try 
  firefox axiom30yr.jpg
which should be a picture of a bayou. The picture is broken. Still.
Even though I explicitly copied a correct version, marked the new
version with svn tags, and had a confirmed commit.

SVN is clearly not ready for prime time.

Hi Tim,

I don't know on which system you work, but I had no problem with the svn 
on debian that I installed via

apt-get -i subversion

Just use

svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk
svn update
-- change something
svn commit

I have no idea why you needed "svn tags". That is basically like copying 
a directory. Completely irrelevant to commit the Gold patches to 
silver/trunk. "svn tags" is definitely not the same as "cvs tag".

Ralf

I have svn installed.

to see the problem do an svn checkout and then do:
  firefox axiom30yr.jpg

svn tries to guess which files are binary.
sometimes it fails.
you can mark the files with svn keyword tags (yes, not CVS tags)
that tell svn that the file is binary. or so they claim. but it failed.

my major problem is that svn appears to have lost my work.
the WHOLE point of version control is NEVER to lose work.
thus SVN appears to miss the main reason it exists.

clearly this must be something i'm doing wrong
but after twice reading the docs and much frustration
i give up.

I've never lost anything with SVN for over a year of heavy usewith
other major projects. 

I'll try to look into your issues later tonight.

Why don't you ask for help at the axiom-developer mailing list?
If you tell what you want to achieve, maybe someone is giving you the 
right commands and you could save your time instead of reading the 
svn-book several times. You probably only need 3 or 4 commands with any 
SCM. But it's always better if someone tells you what and how to use it.

And I believe you are wrong. It's not svn that gets the binary wrong.
I did the following, and the picture was ok. I would have been very much 
surprised if the Subversion people made such a big mistake for a .jpg 
file that very much looks binary.
svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs /home/hemmecke/scratch/SVNMYTEST 

cd ~/scratch
mkdir axiom
cd axiom
cp ~/OTHER/Axiom/axiom--main--1--patch-50/axiom* .
svn import . file:///home/hemmecke/scratch/SVNMYTEST/AXIOM
Adding  (bin)  axiomicon.png
Adding  (bin)  axiom30yr.jpg
Adding  (bin)  axiomsml.png

Anyway the difference of the pictures from Gold and Silver/trunk is a 
translation of 0x0d to 0x0a in several places.

Maybe the picture is already broken in CVS and was wrongly moved from 
CVS to SVN?

I have had no problems at all with svn on linux, but on Windows
using TortoiseSVN I have not yet succeeded in getting a complete
checkout. The symptoms are identical to what you describe: the
download fails, the tree gets locked and although instructed to
use the 'svn cleanup' command to correct the problem, this has
no effect.

When I get serious about using svn on windows I will probably
be forced to use the cygwin version.

I had similar problems with arch (tla) on Windows. The only
source code system that has worked reliably for me on both Linux
and Windows has been darcs.

Bill Page.

Yes, there are still some files in the Axiom CVS that are not
properly marked as binary. When using just CVS this doesn't
matter because CVS does not mangle text file contents. At least
on SourceForge when moving a file from CVS to SVN the binary or
text attribute from CVS is retained. SVN does mangle text files,
recreating what it thinks are proper line endings. I recall that
we discussed this a few months ago when we first set up the SVN
repository.

However Tim did write:

> I marked several hundred files as 'binary', including these
> jpg files.

I am not sure if he was referring to CVS or SVN but obviously
these files should be marked correctly in both places. And your
test shows that this is done automatically by 'svn import' without
having to "mark" them. But I presume that Tim was trying to change
the binary attribute of files that were already in SVN with the
wrong attribute (having been copied from CVS). Perhaps to correct
this problem it is necessary to remove these files first and then
re-import them? Or to mark them properly in CVS and move them
again?

Bill Page.

The CVS manual says

    The `-kb' option available with some CVS commands insures that
neither line ending conversion nor keyword expansion will be done.

    Here is an example of how you can create a new file using the `-kb'
flag:

      $ echo '$Id$' > kotest
      $ cvs add -kb -m"A test file" kotest
      $ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest

    If a file accidentally gets added without `-kb', one can use the
`cvs admin' command to recover.  For example:

      $ echo '$Id$' > kotest
      $ cvs add -m"A test file" kotest
      $ cvs ci -m"First checkin; contains a keyword" kotest
      $ cvs admin -kb kotest
      $ cvs update -A kotest
      # For non-unix systems:
      # Copy in a good copy of the file from outside CVS
      $ cvs commit -m "make it binary" kotest

Let's hope that one can trust that.

> Maybe the picture is already broken in CVS and was wrongly moved from 
> CVS to SVN?

The picture is fine in CVS. I found a site online that said that the
automatic conversion function fails to properly classify binaries.
The SVN site was created automatically from CVS by Sourceforge.
I suspect the binary problem started there.

If you look in PATCH49-50/PATCHES you can see the commands I used
to mark the files. (PATCHES contains all the commands I executed
that modified the repository).

I did an Arch checkout (to axiom) and an SVN checkout (to silver).
Then I did:
   diff -r --brief axiom silver
and found that the axiom30yr.jpg was different because of newlines.
(Why a source code control system changes a file is beyond me.)

So I copied a corrected version, check that it was correct with
   firefox axiom30yr.jpg
and used the recommended command (see the PATCHES file).

Eventually I did
  svn commit
which said it worked. Then it sent email to the list saying
that a commit happened. Thus, my files are now safe (since
commit is supposed to be a transaction, either fully succeeding
or fully failing).

A clean, new checkout shows that the file is still mangled.

And the problem is not only .jpg files. 

If you look at the zips directory some of the patch files 
do not compare. Patch files are straight ascii text. They
are designed to survive being sent by email which traditionally
mangles data.





If you want a silver branch that contains the latest patches
I'm willing to maintain that. But SVN is not a good place to
do that it seems. Since people don't like Arch or CVS perhaps
we could consider darcs which Bill seems to love (and which is
the only system we haven't yet tried).

Failing that I'd be happy to set up a silver Arch branch.

Tim, I think your conclusion is still to "hasty". Yes, SVN has
problems, but like the other systems I am confident that it can
be made to work.

I am sure that we could find ways to screw-up darcs also. :) There
are quite a few projects do use darcs, including Sage and it seems
to be popular with lisp projects:

  http://www.cliki.net/admin/search?words=darcs

But I would *not* recommend that we switch to darcs now - even
though I do think it is a better source code control system.

I think we need to resolve the problems Tim is having with SVN
and then get on with what we have been planning for the last
few months with Axiom Silver on SVN.

Bill Page.

Fully agreed.

The trouble is I don't what his settings are.  All colleagues I work
with here and outside have not reported the same kind of troubles he
is having.  You seem to know the symptoms...  Tim are you indeed using
a windows-based system?  Bill, how did you "solve" the problems?

I'm using Fedora Core 5. There aren't any 'settings' that I'm aware of.
I just did

   svn checkout
   modify files
   svn commit

Under what conditions would you expect to check in a file,
check it out again, and have it not compare? 

Try checking out the Arch golden source and do a 
  diff -r --brief golden silver

At the time I did the silver commit these two source trees were identical.
Following the commit I did an svn checkout and the trees differ radically.

Although the answer is irrelevant to Tim's situation, I do not
have a solution to the problems on Windows yet. Most recently
I upgraded my version of TortioseSVN but the problem did not
go away. My next attempt will be to install the cygwin version
of SVN and try it that way. Of course since we don't build
Axiom under cygwin on Windows, that is less than desirable.
Perhaps there is another native Windows version of SVN besides
Tortoise?

I believe that this would happen if the files you are modifying

I expect this would happen for example to .jpg and .zip files
already in the repository that are not properly labelled as
'binary'. You need to change this attribute in SVN for these
files before doing the commit.

I tried to use windows but the disk is formatted for FAT32.
For some reason the filenames fail to match under windows.
For instance, in the license subdirectory there is (on linux)
an uppercase filename 'LICENSE.AXIOM' which stays uppercase
on the FAT32 disk. But there is an uppercase 'LICENSE.CC'
in the same directory on the same disk which gets stored as
'license.cc' (lowercase). I can't figure out the pattern.
And the system considers 'license.cc' and 'LICENSE.CC' equivalent
names but diff doesn't agree which seriously complicates the compare.

True. Apparently SVN likes to rewrite end-of-line characters.
I don't know why.

Well, it's not quite that simple as there is no 'binary' attribute
in SVN. But I did find the equivalent command, at least I think I
did, and changed it for the files. See PATCH49-50/PATCHES.

And it is not simply 'binary' vs 'text' apparently. SOME of the
.patch files (not all, which puzzles) in zips have been changed
by SVN. The .patch files are clearly text.

Or maybe they don't even know what cross-compilation is? ;) Did you
read the description of the SBCL "cross-compilation" process?

http://sbcl-internals.cliki.net/Build

Even the first line on the page Gaby quoted above says:

"Unlike most free software, SBCL can't bootstrap itself directly
from the gcc suite."

So all the rest that follows is related to this feature of SBCL. In
contrast, GCL *can* be built directly given gcc and continues to
depend on gcc even after it is built. In that sense GCL is just an
extension of gcc. So if the SBCL definition of cross-compile is
allowed, then of course both GCL and Axiom can be "cross-compiled".
All we have to do is first cross-compile gcc for the target system.
Then we just proceed to build GCL on the target system as we would
any other system (as is done on Debian for example).

Notice the steps under "Cross-Compiling" on the SBCL page look more
like Tim's description of "Cross-Mounting" than cross-compiling.
The final SBCL binary is built on the target system through a
standard lisp 'save-system' command - *not* on the host.

http://sbcl-internals.cliki.net/make-target-2

So it is clear that SBCL can not be cross-compiled in the sense
of simply specifying a target different from the host system on
the ./configure command.

Most of GCL is written in C. It does not require an existing ANSI
Common Lisp executable as a host for initial bootstrapping the way
SBCL does. So "cross-compiling" GCL is actually easier than in the
case of SBCL.

If what SBCL does is cross-compiling than it seems that we have
simply been arguing over semantics (the same words used differently)
and not a real problem. :(

On the other hand I would prefer to use the term 'cross-compile"
in a more standard manner, to refer to the case where the final
target code is created on the host system.

Since the Axiom compiler is written in Lisp and BOOT, and BOOT
compiles to Lisp, and GCL compiles Lisp to C, and GCL is
written in C and is compiled with gcc, and gcc can be cross-
compiled ... what is the problem?

These days Maxima is usually built using Clisp, but GCL is still
an option of the configure. Clisp is at included in the Fedora
Linux distribution (extras). Debian includes both Clisp and GCL.

Clisp uses a byte-code interpreter. It does not compile to object
code on the target machine, so cross-compilation should not be
much of an issue, but I was not able to find anything in the Clisp
documentation that suggests that ./configure actually supports
cross-compilation, i.e. creating a binary for target system
different than the host.

It is also not clear to me from the maxima ./configure options
if the Maxima build can compile Clisp byte-code intended for
use on a target system different from the host. Has anyone tried
this? E.g. Successfully building a version of Maxima for Sparc
hardware on an i386 Linux system?

Bill Page.

What you did looks ok to me except that I notice you did not remove
the eol-style property on the jpg files. I think you need:

   svn propdel svn:eol-style *.jpg

Could this be the problem?

Yes, see:

http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#binary-files

I think you might need to check/set the properties

  svn proplist *.jpg

  svn propset svn:mime-type image/jpeg filename.jpg

  svn propdel svn:eol-style filename.jpg

  cd zips

  svn proplist *.tgz

  svn propget svn:mime-type *.tgz

  svn propget svn:eol-style *.patch

  svn propset svn:mime-type application/octet-stream filename.tgz

  svn propset svn:eol-style native filename.patch

etc.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Huh?!?

| Did you
| read the description of the SBCL "cross-compilation" process?

*Yes*.

| http://sbcl-internals.cliki.net/Build
|
| Even the first line on the page Gaby quoted above says:
|
| "Unlike most free software, SBCL can't bootstrap itself directly
| from the gcc suite."

Yes, that does not preclude cross-compilation.

You see, GCC for example, can no longuer be bootstrapped with a K&R C
compiler.  You need an ANSI C compiler to bootstrap GCC, just like you
need a LISP compiler to bootstrap SBCL.

The (in)ability of bootstrapping from GCC does not constitute a
criteria of cross-compilation.  However, it may be an issue in the
context of GNU toolchain.

| So all the rest that follows is related to this feature of SBCL. In
| contrast, GCL *can* be built directly given gcc and continues to
| depend on gcc even after it is built.

The question is not whether GCL can be built directly given gcc, but
whether GCL can be cross-compiled in the context of GNU toolchain.  If
GCL claims to be the official GNU implementation of Common Lisp, then
we better find a way to get there.

Exactly what are you disputing now?  That Lisp cannot be
cross-compiled?  Or that SBCL cannot be cross-compiled or that that
cross-compilation must consist of ./configure --target=...?

That is important to know, because it is no longer clear to me what
you're driving at.

Take GCC for example, you CANNOT cross-compile it if you do not have
the binutils binaries for the target system.   That is a pretty much a
basic requirement -- similar to SBSL requiring a sufficiently
ANSI-compliant Lisp to start up.

Furthermore, if you want to bootstrap GCC on a platform (say HPUX)
lacking an ANSI C compiler, you need at least a binary of GCC
for that platform.   I don't see that situation different from SBCL
requiring a LISP compiler to start up bootstrap.


| In that sense GCL is just an extension of gcc.

LOL.  In that sense, the whole world is an extension of GCC.
But, again, being an extension of GCC is not the issue at hand.
Many software are extension of GCC (in your sense), still fare better
with cross-compilation.  I suspect being an extension of GCC is not a
sufficient condition.

| So if the SBCL definition of cross-compile is
| allowed, then of course both GCL and Axiom can be "cross-compiled".
| All we have to do is first cross-compile gcc for the target system.

Yes, but that is still insufficient.  We need to do more work to get
to cross-compilation with the GNU toolchain -- that is all that counts
if we ever want Axiom (based on GCL) shipped with linux distros.

| Then we just proceed to build GCL on the target system as we would
| any other system (as is done on Debian for example).

Yes, we *just*.  Except that at the moment, we don't make sure that
will work in a cross-compilation context with the GNU toolchain.  I
tried yesterday afternoon with no luck :-(

| Notice the steps under "Cross-Compiling" on the SBCL page look more
| like Tim's description of "Cross-Mounting" than cross-compiling.
| The final SBCL binary is built on the target system through a
| standard lisp 'save-system' command - *not* on the host.

yes; who asked you to save GCL image on the host?

This is situation is no different from what we (speaking of GCC) are
used to when we have to regression-test GCC on different architecture
(which include *bootstrapping* a cross-compiled compiler and *use* it)
when we don't have access to the target.

      http://gcc.gnu.org/simtest-howto.html

My question is very simple: Can I set up an environment like that that
let cross-compile GCL?  The asnwer at the moment is NO.  Can it be
done. The answer is YES.  Do I need cross-mounting?  I think NO.
No matter how much you deny cross-compilation of Lisp.

|
| Most of GCL is written in C. It does not require an existing ANSI
| Common Lisp executable as a host for initial bootstrapping the way
| SBCL does. So "cross-compiling" GCL is actually easier than in the
| case of SBCL.

Huh?!?

| If what SBCL does is cross-compiling than it seems that we have
| simply been arguing over semantics (the same words used differently)
| and not a real problem. :(

what SBCL does is cross-compilation.  I don't believe I have been
arguing over semantics.  I do have a fundamental issue.  How do I get
Axiom (and therefore GCL) to support cross-compilation in the context
of GNU toolchain.  First, you have suggested that anyone thinking of
cross-compiling GCL does not understand Lsip.  When offered compeling
Lisp-based system supporting cross-compilation, you are that


| On the other hand I would prefer to use the term 'cross-compile"
| in a more standard manner, to refer to the case where the final
| target code is created on the host system.

*which* final code?

|
| Since the Axiom compiler is written in Lisp and BOOT, and BOOT

| written in C and is compiled with gcc, and gcc can be cross-

is that supposed to be an existential proof?

Sorry, I've little time for quibbling.  If you believe Axiom in its
current form supports cross-compilation in the GNU toolchain context,
please work out precisely th details for me.  That would sve me lot of
work.  Otherwise, help me with more constructive proofs.

Here is an idea of what it takes to cross-compile GCC, for example

     http://linux.bytesex.org/cross-compiler.html

(or course, I could have given you the link to Dan Kegel's more
elaborated and complete crosstool suite, but I prefer the above link
for its simplicity at exposing the core issues.

Please, again have a look at the description of how SBCL achieves
cross-compilation.

Done. Because, I saw terribly wrong properties set, I simply removed the 
files from SVN/trunk and added the correct versions. Now we have.

Properties on 'axiom/axiom30yr.jpg':
   svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
Properties on 'axiom/axiomicon.png':
   svn:executable : *
   svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
Properties on 'axiom/axiomlogo.jpg':
   svn:executable : *
   svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
Properties on 'axiom/axiomsml.png':
   svn:executable : *
   svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream

The executable property probably comes from the fact that my fresh 
checkout of Gold has the executable bit set.

But I have the impression that those files are not the only once that 
cause trouble.

For example,

Properties on 'axiom/src/hyper/viewports/ugGraphTwoDOptionsPage7.VIEW/data':
   svn:keywords : Author Date Id Revision
   svn:eol-style : native
Properties on 
'axiom/src/hyper/viewports/ugGraphTwoDOptionsPage7.VIEW/graph0':
   svn:keywords : Author Date Id Revision
   svn:eol-style : native
Properties on 
'axiom/src/hyper/viewports/ugGraphTwoDOptionsPage7.VIEW/image.bm.Z':
   svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
   svn:keywords : Author Date Id Revision
   svn:eol-style : native
Properties on 
'axiom/src/hyper/viewports/ugGraphTwoDOptionsPage7.VIEW/image.xpm.Z':
   svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
   svn:keywords : Author Date Id Revision
   svn:eol-style : native

There are also other .Z files that have svn:keywords and svn:eol-style set.

The whole axiom/src/hyper/bitmaps directory contains files with

   svn:keywords : Author Date Id Revision
   svn:eol-style : native

I don't think that the conversion CVS-->SVN was the best idea. It should 
have been "svn import" from the tla archive. Tim, is there something 
like a "tla export" which gives the files without the tla status files 
(like that .arch-ids directory)?

Gaby, since we want Silver/trunk to be in sync with Tim's Gold-to-be 
branch, would it make sense to remove the archive and just import from 
--patch-50 anew? I have no idea however, how to merge then with the 
build-improvements branch. Or do you have more experience with SVN to 
cure the problem?

Ralf

I do agree that "import" would have been a better setup.  Oh well,

Interesting.  We do definetly want silver to be in sync with gold
wherever possible.  The only issue with respect to restarting again is
indeed what happens to  work done on branches made on silver.  I
suspect that at the moment, we have two branches where people have
"actively" put work: the one by Antoine and the build-improvements.

I'm not familiar with Antoine's branch to comment.

As of the build-improvements, we have some work there that might not
cleanly apply to a fresh tree from gold -- I really don't know, that
is just a first approximation thought.  I have more work in the
pipeline waiting for testing and fixes; this is done against current
silver.

Do you believe we cannot fix the other "binary" type files without
restarting afresh (would have been much simpler if we did not have other
branches)?

Tim, would you release --patch-50 as a new version of Axiom?

I would like to tell people, go and pick that tarball -- it is
official release -- and build and install it.  

I would rather avoid "get CVS, tla, svn", and then figure out whether
you make something out of it.

I am sure Antoine comments on it.

Well, my problem is that I don't know what happens if I simply remove 
the svn:eol-style and svn:keywords properties. We should certainly 
remove the svn:keywords property from ALL files. The svn:eol-style would 
probably not do any harm since internally svn stores the files with a 
Unix line end marker. The problem is that all binaries that are in SVN 
might be corrupt inside the archive, since if the svn:eol-style property 
is set, then svn translates 0x0D to 0x0A (Mac -> Unix) while putting the 
file into the svn repository. So no matter whether I delete the property 
now, the file is corrupt. (My guess, I haven't actually checked it.)

So basically, the procedure would be.

1) Remove the svn:keywords property from ALL files.
2) Remove the svn:eol-style property from binary files (maybe even ALL
    would be OK???)
3) Checkout a fresh copy of silver/trunk.
4) Copy all source files from --patch-50 to silver/trunk.
5) Commit the change.
    My wild guess is that svn only commits the files that actually differ
    from the repository. I hope that svn does not take the copy date into
    account.

I don't know whether the property change can be merged with the 
build-improvements. Any experience?

See question above. Does anybody have experience with merging properties 
from one branch to another?

Before any change to the trunk is done. We should make clear that it 
would be the right procedure.

There have been doubts here wether Lisp systems can be croos- 
compiled. Let me mention here a simple method which is used
by some Lisp-like system -- this method shows that cross-
compiling Lisp has no fundamental problems (only usual
problems).

First, why croos-compiling Lisp looks difficult? The reason
is dynamic nature of Lisp: freshly compiled code is loaded
into hast system and used in subsequent compilations. Moreover,
compiling Lisp means building apropriate data structures
which mix ordinary data with machine code. There seem to
be difficulty here: we want data stuctures containg target
machine code as a final result, but during compilation we
need host machine code.

One method which can solve this difficulty is: compile
everything twice, one version for host machine to be
used in further compilation, the second one for target.
In particular, for GCL one can probably just run the
C compiler twice to get object files for target machine.

If done naively this process still requires loading
object files into target Lisp to build the final image.
With such a method to do full build on host one has to
provide cross-Lisp capable just of loading object files
and saving image. While non-trivial (since some code is
executed at load time) such limited cross-Lisp should be
much simpler than full compiler. Alternatively, since
final loading of object files and dumping image is
unlikely to be time critical one can build the final
image at install time.

Of course there are usual cross-compilation problems, for
example (in GCL case) one must make sure that generated
C code works both on host and target machine.

Yes.  That is tricky too since GCL uses some "non-standard" aspects of C.

No, that is just what SBCL does and of course it can be done
with GCL as well without the bootstrapping issue. GCL already
runs on all of the Debian architectures. That is better than
an existential proof, it is proof by construction.

You originally raised the issue, claiming that this prevents
the inclusion of Axiom in major Linux distributions. If this
is just a "quibble", then that is quite unfortunate for Axiom.

I find your non-analytic, confrontational manner about this
issue to be rather surprising, given that you obviously
understand and are contributing to the solution of a lot of
other more important issues. I suppose this prompts me to
reply in a like manner. I am sorry for that. :(

But really I am not so sure this is such an important issue.
After all, we do have Axiom available on Debian and Ubantu via

  apt-get install axiom*

Installing Axiom on other major platforms is quite straight
forward. Maybe that is enough. None of Mathematica, Maple,
Maxima nor Sage are include any of the "major" Linux
distributions.

No, GCL (and therefore Axiom) does *not* support cross-
compilation.

Could you remind me why you want to do this, again?

I repeat: What is the problem?

I thought you said you did not want the Axiom compiler to be a
cross-compiler, but only that you wish to cross-compile Axiom.
If by cross-compile, what you really mean is to port Axiom then
(in principle) all that you need to do to do this is to cross-
compile gcc. Of course there are some "sticky issues" concerning
memory management and interface to native operating systems.
This is what prevents for example an easy port of GCL (and Axiom)
from Linux to Windows.

I read it in detail. SBCL does *not* achieve cross-compilation.
You (and they) are confusing porting an application with cross-
compilation. There is nothing in the SBCL build process that
cannot already be done using GCL - already is done on Debian.

Bill Page.

I'm quite disappointed by the very manner you approach this issue.

I've bee made aware the Axiom build issue and started work on it.
With the goal of eventually having a system that can be cross-compiled.

You started out a few days ago claiming that anybody who speaks of
cross-compilation of Axiom does not understand who Lisp works.
If your assertion were true, it would effectively stop fruitless work
in early stage and save reousrces.

Therefore, I very politely requested that you elaborate in a
comprehensive manner why you believe that.  You very have consistently
refused to explain yourself.  I've offered examples.  You either
dismiss them, or turn around.  And now, you complain I'm
non-analytical and confrontational.  That IS disppointing.

Please either explain yourself or let's stop this nonsense.

Just so I can see if I'm successfully following this or not, can I try
and list a few points and see if I am understanding them correctly?

We want to use gcc and the GNU tools to create a binary targeted for HP
Unix Debian Linux on a Sparc, or Windows on an x86 Linux host, that can
be copied from Linux to the target system with ftp or a USB stick and
run with no further compiling.  The target system is in no way required
for anything except running the final binary. Is this what Linux
distributors want to be able to do?  And is the issue that GCL cannot
currently build using the non-host-system binutils and include files
that are required for this to work?  Or will Axiom also have trouble
even if we get GCL itself to do this?

Things We Can Do:

1.  Camm and the Debian team can build GCL and Axiom on a wide variety
of target platforms, but it is not clear if they are doing this using
the "normal" way Linux distributions want to or have some special
provisions like having at least one machine of every target type
available.  Based on Gaby's comments I take it the Debian solution is
not general enough to meet everyone's needs, however they are doing it.

2.  We can build on Linux and sometimes Windows using existing tools on
those platforms, but we cannot build a Linux binary on Windows or a
Windows binary on Linux.  (Correct?)

Moving to other platforms, our options are:

1.  Produce a working GCL for a platform, then build Axiom on that
platform using the GCL made for it

2.  Produce a working GCL and a working Axiom binary for a platform,
with no compiling work done on the target system.

Is that the distinction here Gaby?  Doing 1 is NOT cross-compiling,
while #2 is?  And #2 is the one we currently cannot do?

Cheers,
Cliff

That is not true.

I have explained and so had David Mentre and a few other people

I have explained in detail why I dismiss them. In each case they
do not satisfy even your own definition of cross-compilation
when earlier you quoted:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-compiling

in a response to Tim.

"Compiling a program takes place by running a compiler on the
build platform. The compiled program will run on the host platform.
Usually these two are the same; if they are different, the process
is called cross-compilation."

In the SBCL example, the program compilation is not complete until
after extensive initialization and the final 'save-system' which must
be done on the target system. The target is integrally involved in
the process. This is not cross-compilation. At best it attempts to
save a little time by doing *some* of the intermediate compilation
on the host. This is the same thing that Tim described as "cross-
mounting". In that case, the time required to compile SPAD and BOOT
to Lisp is saved by doing this only once on the host.

> And now, you complain I'm non-analytical and confrontational.
> That IS disappointing.

I said that because you have never answered any of my questions
in this thread. You have only been issuing "challenges". I've
numbered the questions 1) and 2) in this email just so you don't
miss them again. :)

> 
> Please either explain yourself or let's stop this nonsense.

When Axiom is built using GCL, gcc becomes an integral part of
Axiom. Axiom cannot run without it. gcc is called every time you
define a function. So to run Axiom you must provide the gcc
environment. If you have the gcc environment, then GCL and Axiom
can be built on the target environment. 2) What is the point of
"jumping-through-hoops" to try to arrange that some part of the
build can take place on a host environment separate from the
target when in the end the target must have the same environment,
must be sufficiently powerful to run Axiom and must in any case
be involved in the creation of the resulting program?

Bill Page.

I'm not familiar enough with the way the Debian people do it.  My

understood, we need to do a bit more and then we can take on.
But, I suspect that the linux distros are familiar with the way debian
people do it. Apart from that and other reasons I alluded to I don't
know more about why they do it the way they prefer to do it.

#2 is the one we cannot currently do.

Elaborating on your #1, if we can produce #1 plus a "cheap" simulator
to build Axiom, then we would be in a very good shape.  Simulators
already exist in the GNU tools chain (see the link I gave earlier
about the way we test GCC on targets we don't have access to).  We
need to convince Axiom to work with GNU toolchains -- that is what
I've been spending time on so far.

Because I believe that making Axiom more accessible is a very

One way of making Axiom accessible is by "convincing" popular

I however agree there are other important issues to address. At the

you follow a cross-compilation of GCC step by step, you'll notice

noticeable.  The "save image" step in the SBCL case, corresponds to
the "linking step" of GCC and its dependence on libgcc (except that
the linker does not run the executable but in needs to be a cross).
The save image step can be made by a simple "loader-n-saver" that
indeed need to run on the target but that loader-n-saver does not need
to be a full-implementation (therefore small) and get to run in a
simulator.  That is cheap.  You would have done all the work on the
host and the tiny tricky on the simulated target.  You would have
produced the whole suite without having access to the target.  That is
cross-compilation.

The compile farm is a really nice thing for sourceforge to offer, but
nonetheless seems to have problems.  I was unable to compile Axiom on
any of the compile farm machines.  The problem was either:
  * misconfigured subversion
  * no subversion installed
  * no latex installed

Apparently apt-get works on at least 2 of the 10 major distributions.
And the rpms created via alien from the Debian binaries seem work
on at least Fedora and SuSe but of course you have to satisfy any
dependencies manually.

Debian and Ubuntu seem to be pretty widely used to me. They are both
listed here with the "top 10":

http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=3Dmajor

There does not seem to be any easy way to get statistics on the
actual number of installed Linux systems. But I think we have
received reports of successful installation of Axiom on all of
these "major" systems.

During August (which was a pretty typical month) the Linux binaries
for Axiom were downloaded 120 times while the Windows binaries for
Axom where downloaded 521 times (not counting BitTorrent downloads).

> One way of making Axiom accessible is by "convincing" popular
> Linux distros to bundle it with their packages.

1) For how many people would that make Axiom significantly more
   accessible than it is already? Ok, having it on your "extras"
   CD might be convenient but does that really make such a
   difference?

2) Since Maxima is not currently included any "popular Linux
   distros" and it has been in line much longer than Axiom, what
   chance does Axiom have of being included? As far as I know no
   computer algebra package is included in any "major" Linux
   distribution except Debian.

I really doubt that "accessibility" of Axiom is a problem. We
have Axiom on Knoppix and other Knoppix-based LiveCD's, we have
Axiom on the DoyenCD (Fedora 3), and even have Axiom directly
accessible over the web.

I think simply including the DoyenCD with the Axiom Tutorial
book (which is already available to university book stores
through standard channels like Amazon) would have a bigger
impact than anything we do through the Linux distributions.

I am all for exposing Axiom to a larger number of people, but
adding Axiom to the 10,000 other packages that are included in
the typical Linux distribution doesn't seem like such a great
strategy to me.

3) Do you think Mathematica and Maple have been successful at
   getting their products "to the masses"?

4) Is that the kind of goal that you would like to set for Axiom?

>From my point of view, even though both companies spend quite a
lot on advertising in the academic and scientific communities, they
still seem to have serious problems achieving wider acceptance of
computer algebra as "tool for the masses". It seems to me the
reasons are much deeper than just accessibility.

Yes, that is just my belief but I will try to cite some statistics
to make it seem more plausible. On http://popcon.debian.org Axiom
is currently ranked 9964 out of 23688 while Maxima is at 3694.
The popularity graphs show that the number of Axiom installations
appears to be still rising (although not quickly) while Maxima
installations have (more or less) leveled off. Both Axiom and
Maxima are equally accessible to Debian users. So accessibility
does not seem to be a factor in the observed difference.

Of course since participation on Debian popcon is optional,
it is easy to dispute the actual meaning of these numbers.

I don't count that as any sort of credible "answer".

6) In what sense could this be called a "common requirement"? Which
   Linux distributions requre that all packages be cross-compilable?
   What other packages like Axiom are cross-compilable?

That is certainly not a direct quote from me. But I do think that
anyone who suggests that cross-compilation of Axiom is desirable
must have some basic misunderstanding of how Axiom is built on
Lisp or (maybe) are using the term "cross-compilation" in some
non-standard way. And I do believe there are better ways of spending
time on Axiom then trying to satisfy artificial requirements that
have such dubious benefits.

I am afraid you no longer qualify. But I still have some hope that
continuing this discussion might help to convince you not to spend
much time on what seems to me is obviously a "fool's errand".

Of course this is just my "arm chair" opinion. I am sorry if the
expression of my opinion annoys you or seems to waste your time.
But this is an open source project, so I am sure that you will
continue with your contributions to Axiom or not, as you see fit.

What you wrote above sounds self-contradictory.

Axiom uses GCL to compile functions and SPAD code. Or more precisely:
since Axiom is a Lisp application, Axiom *includes* GCL as an integral
part of the program. Axiom/GCL compiles function definitions and SPAD
code to C. GCL does require a GCC environment to compile the generated
C code to object code and to link the object code into the Axiom image.

For example on Windows, the necessary parts of the GCC environment
(including the GCC compiler) must be copied from MSYS/MinGW and these
are included in the self-install binary distribution file for Windows.

No.

I did not intend to ask a question containing a mischaracterization.
I believe that the presumptions of the question are accurate.

7) Why do you say: "you know that is not the case"? What part of
   what I wrote above do you think is not true?

Bill Page.

I am very interested in this subject. As you might know, we
do already have some support for SAGE on the Axiom wiki
website:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSage

This not based on the SAGE notebook concept, but rather on sage
/examples/latex_embed methods created by Gonzalo Tornaria and
Joe Wetherell et al.

Adapting the Sage notebook to be used by Axiom sounds very
interesting. Of course I am also interested in providing a more
general interface to Axiom from Sage in the same manner as the
existing Maxima interface.

Because of firewall restrictions I have problems accessing non-
standard HTTP ports like 9001 from my usual place of work. Is
there anyway you can make the NotebookWiki page accessible
through port 80 or 443? Or would you mind if I proxied your
site via the Apache web server at axiom-developer.org?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Recently, we've been discussing adapting the notebook to be used by Axiom and other languages.  I commented that I've been contemplating a fusion of the SAGE notebook, and the wiki idiom.  I thought I'd have gotten around to this sooner, but I've finally posted my ideas to the SAGE wiki.  This is by no means complete, but I want to get other people into the discussion early on.

I've started working on this some.  I got distracted by a bunch of travel  
though,
which just came to an end.  Probably what will happen is that I'll make a  
first
version that works, but for which some standard things in Axiom are hard  
to do,
or some things are too slow, and we'll work to make the interface more  
usable.

I haven't only because of laziness.   If you could give me instructions
how to do this (sage.math is an ubuntu linux box running apache2), I
could do it.

Please do and let me know the address.

Thanks!

Have you seen my axiom/tiddlywiki demo?
    http://bob.mcelrath.org/moz-axiom.tar.gz

I have gotten more heavily involved in the TiddlyWiki project, which is
a CLIENT-side wiki, and as such I think it is much more appropriate as a
basis of personal mathematical computation.  In the above example each
wiki node is a logical unit of computation that can be mixed & matched.
I think this idiom may be quite powerful and we should continue to try
ideas along these lines.

Whether or not you like tiddlywiki, I think the web browser as an
interface is extremely powerful, due to firefox's knowledge of MathML,
and straightforward UI interaction that can be done with css,
javascript, and AJAX.  This nicely abstracts the interface from the
axiom server.

What ever happened with embedding a web server in axiom a la axiomui?
If someone can point me to a build of axiom which contains a web server,
I can whip up the equivalent to the above using a newer axiom and
TiddlyWiki version, where the interface would use AJAX to communicate
with the axiom server.  This would all be local, no web hosting needed.
(I'd very much like to do this...but have been unable to find the
axiomui code, and just building it would cost me a week of pain...)

I've tried various ideas using netcat, and similar tools to pipe command
line interfaces over HTTP, but to no success (so far).  But, perhaps it
can still be done...

Yes. I agree that the client-side wiki concept has a great deal of
merit.

The Sage NoteBook of course uses these methods and communicates
with Sage running a web server embedded in Python. I expect that
what Tom is suggesting would require a similar interface to Axiom.

AxiomUI

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomUI

uses a separate webserver called 'araneida' written in common lisp
that runs in as a process separate from Axiom and communicates
with Axiom via two-way-stream: See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--GUI--1/src/web-gui/AxiomHubLisp

With a little help from those-more-knowledgeable-in-Lisp-than-I,
It should be possible to resurrect at least this part of AxiomUI.

I am very encouraged that you are motivated to continue this
work. For the AxiomUI source code see the links above, but if
you haven't used Lisp before, you might be right about the
"week of pain". :-) I hope we can attract some Lisp helpers...

Camm Maguire also provided some very simple web server code in
Lisp that can be run from inside Axiom:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-04/msg00141.html

Kai Kaminski did not use this approach for AxiomUI because it
required a version 2.6.7 of GCL that was not yet in common use
in Axiom.

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-06/msg00201.ht
ml

Plus he may have had some concerns about the desire to make sure
that calls to Axiom could be made "non-blocking", e.g. in the case
that Axiom goes into a loop or extremely long calculation. But if
you would like to attempt something this way, I would be glad to
help you get started. I did go so far as to verify that this
mini-webserver in Lisp does work. To complete the interface to
Axiom, we also need to be able to issue Axiom commands from Lisp
and to return Axiom output as a string to be parsed in a manner
similar to what is done in AxiomHubLisp above. Tim Daly provided
some key code in Axiom/Lisp for doing this about the same time as
the start of the AxiomUI project. I think this is in the axiom-
developer email list archives. If you want, I can take a look for
it.

I definitely would not want to go that route.

Hi,

This may be a very stupid question.  Does Axiom support OS X (Intel) in  
any way,
either building from source or from pre-compiled binaries?   Or is Axiom  
Windows and
Linux only?  For at least the next few weeks, I'm using OS X full time for  
working
on SAGE, and the first step toward writing an Axiom interface is to  
install Axiom.
However, when I search the Axiom web site and the download links, I can't  
find
anything about using it with OS X.  Morever, the tarball (the "gold"  
version from Sept 05)
says it doesn't know anything about Darwin:

   "Finished extraction
   Darwin
   Your system name is Darwin
   We do not know how to build for this kind of system
   Send a note to axiom-developer@nongnu.org about it"

Should I get a certain recent cvs snapshot?

Note -- if Axiom is Linux only this isn't a show stopper, since I can just
write the interface under Linux.  I just want to know.

Great. I took a look at the Maxima interface, but it was a bit
overwelming as a place start for me as a novice Sage developer
(although I must admit I learnt somethings about using Pexpect
that I am already planning to duplicate on Axiom Wiki :). If you
can give me even a basic shell that calls Axiom with some command
and returns a result to Sage, plus some hints as to how to install
and test it in my Sage installation, then I would be glad to try
to help.

You will need to add something like the following to your Apache
configuration file:

LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
...
<VirtualHost 209.135.140.38>
  ServerName   sage-notebook.axiom-developer.org
  ErrorLog     /home/page/sage-logs/error_log
  CustomLog    /home/page/sage-logs/access_log common
  ProxyPass    / http://sage.math.washington.edu:8100/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://sage.math.washington.edu:8100/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost 209.135.140.38>
  ServerName   sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org
  ErrorLog     /home/page/sage-logs/error_log
  CustomLog    /home/page/sage-logs/access_log common
  ProxyPass    / http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://sage.math.washington.edu:9001/
</VirtualHost>

These are the actual configuration options used on the
axiom-developer server. Of course you must change the ip
address and directories as appropriate for your system.

If you get stuck or if this is very unclear, let me know and
I can give you more explicit instructions.

Here is the axiom-developer proxy address for your wiki:

http://sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org

Here also is an axiom-developer proxy for the prototype
NotebookWiki at http://sage.math.washington.edu:8100

http://sage-notebook.axiom-developer.org

Both of these work fine through my firewall.

The problem is that I've been unable to get the port to work.
I've narrowed it down to the fact that I probably installed Fink wrong.
I'm not a MAC user by trade so it's hard for me. There is no fundamental
reason why it won't work it's just that the MAC environment is so foreign
to me that I keep getting tripped up.

I am the same.  Getting SAGE to build on OS X was much harder for me than
even getting it to build on Cygwin.   I'm forcing myself to learn OS X
right now (by using it), partly since so many potential end users are
using it these days.   By the way, Justin Walker (justin@mac.com) is often
extremely helpful and sorting out compilation issues on OS X.

Why do you need fink for building axiom?  Probably you just need the latest
Xcode install (it's a very good idea to get the latest version, since there
were very annoying bugs in earlier versions).

While I am certainly not the expert here, I do know that Debian in
particular has given considerable thought to portability.
Traditionally, it has supported synchronous releases on 11 different
architectures -- a truly massive feat, especially when considering the
size of the archive.

As time has progressed, the spread between the fastest and slowest
machines has widened, and this has sparked some dicussion on the
development mailing lists regarding a possible  two-tier
classification system for supported arches into 'main' and 'scc'
("second-class citizen").  Some such moves are inevitable I suppose at
some point, but I just want to emphasize how many bugs have been shaken
out of gcl supporting all these different machines, how much bloat had
to be remmoved to make it feasible, and how much remarkable support
has been offered from the respective supporters of the particular
architectures.  The m68k crowd (aka former amiga users) is
particularly amazing.

In this discussion, some consideration was given to constructing
cross-compiling auto-builders.  While I did not follow it to the end,
the consensus appeared to be that the technology was not yet
sufficiently fool-proof.  You can dig this up on the debian-devel
archives if interested.

Nothing AFAICT in the existing build framework.  I just want to
mention that GCL unlike some other lisp systems supports both an
interpreter and a compiler.  This is primarily to aid in developing
and debugging the compiler, but also provides some means for platform
independent work.  The whole Axiom system should load and run
interpreted if desired, and if one has a massive amount of time on
one's hands :-).  The same holds for the GCL lisp files -- check out
the saved_pre_gcl image.

One item of medium term interest in GCL development is a just-in-time
byte-code compiler/interpreter for faster platform-independent
(i.e. non-native code) execution.  Few have expressed an interest in
this thus far.

I think one can reduce the problem down to cross-compiling C code
produced by gcl/axiom running interpreted.

Yes, but that version will be out of date.  For example, the XCode
that came with my Macbook Pro DVD compiles PARI incorrectly (the unit
tests fail).  But the tests are fine with the latest version of XCode.

Yes, I've done this and it worked well for me.  Note that the download
is nearly 1GB.

I just checked and the current version is indeed "XCode 2.4", and the
website says "The Xcode 2.4 release provides overall stability improvement
and adds support for 64-bit Intel based Mac computers. It is recommended
that all Xcode users install this update."

Note that I think you have to have OS X 10.4.x to install the new version
of XCode.

You might consider "turning off" fink when doing the Axiom port to
avoid confusion, e.g., move /sw to /sw.orig, at least assuming that
Axiom doesn't depend on packages you only get via fink.

If you have a Mac, it "comes with".  It is not installed by default,  
but you can install it from the CD/DVD that came with your system.

Failing that, go to <http://developer.apple.com>, and sign up as an  
"on-line" developer (gratis).  Then you should be able to download  
Xcode corresponding to the version of the system you have (assuming  
it's a 10.4 system, get Xcode 2.4): it's in the Developer Tools area  
of the Downloads page.

Of course, since you are already building, you must have it installed  
(the Xcode package has the compiler tool chain in it) :-}

One issue with Fink (or DarwinPorts, for that matter) is that the  
setup includes all dependencies, so the potential for duplication is  
significant.  The problem both projects are solving by doing this is  
to keep dependencies out of the mix, so it's hard to fault them; it's  
just that the disk space used can get large.

Thanks for bringing that up; I neglected to go into that detail :-}

Depending on what version of things you have (Mac OS X, Xcode),  
William is correct: you should upgrade to the latest compatible  
version of the developer tools (earlier versions are available for  
download on Apple's developer site).  It's a fact of life that for  
SAGE to work well, being up to date with the latest available  
compiler revs is generally required.

Yup; the developer site should provide guidance on compatibility  
issues; if there are questions, ask here.

Absolutely.  If you are developing something to put into SAGE, you  
*must* turn off both Fink ("/sw") and DarwinPorts (usually in "/opt/ 
local").  Since most users of SAGE will be missing at least one of  
these, the dependencies will cause SAGE to break on Mac OS X.

Axiom already does this. I use it for deep debugging.
The debugsys image is automatically created in the OBJ/SYS directory.

CCL (part of the axiom pile) and CLISP both provide this ability.
Both are portable but slow relative to GCL which was chosen for speed.
There is also a byte-coded lisp that uses the Java VM. This is a solved
problem so I wouldn't spend too much time on it.

CLISP provides a portable ANSI platform and is the one I'm using to test
the ANSI port for Axiom. I'm unlikely to release Axiom on that platform
but will wait use a compiled lisp (hopefully GCL when it is ready).

Instead of a byte-code effort I'd much rather see the ability to 
portably construct a window in which I can draw colored lines from lisp.
Such an effort will make it possible for the graphics to be ported.
There is a lot of work going on in this area and I think it is important.

In general I'd take direction from the Java crowd about new functionality.
Java is interesting only because you can portably do networking, graphics,
database, etc. Lisp is missing the fundamental support hooks to build
these libraries.

Just my opinion.

William,

So SAGE is using Xcode and not Fink? Thus it would help future
compatibility if I used Xcode?

Indeed.  While I was messing myself with src/interp, I stumbled over it
two days ago and I find it useful.

There is a terminological speed-bump here: Fink (as is DarwinPorts)  
is a "community" project whose aim, roughly, is to make a lot of open- 
source software easily available on Mac OS X, in a way that minimizes  
the hassle for the user.  There have been long, heated, discussions  
on the pros and cons, but the essential point is that these are "add- 
ins" that many users may be unaware of, unwilling to install, or  
actively hostile to, Fink.

Xcode is two things: it's a package of tools for development on Mac  
OS X; and it's an IDE for working on programming/debugging/editing  
tasks.

What you really want are the tools: the compiler(s) and link/loader.   
These are packaged with Xcode, but aren't Xcode.

So: you need to have Xcode (the package) installed, but you don't  
need to "use Xcode".

I hope that is both clearer, and not too pedantic.

Regards,

Justin

Correct.  Building all of SAGE from source has 0 dependency on Fink or  
Darwin Ports.
All it requires is a few of the compiler tools in XCode.

Weren't we looking at gcltk last time?  I cleaned this up specifically
for this purpose.

If you can live with X emulation on Windows, etc., you should be able
to try xgcl now.  I.e. you should be able to remove --disable-xgcl
from the compile flags with current 2.6.8pre.  Just do (xgcl-demo) at
the prompt.

Likewise there was the browser/gcl http server idea.

Otherwise, I am at a loss as to what would constitute a good solution
here.  We could get an interface to wxwindows pretty easily, but what
will be definitive and stand the test of time?

Alas, that boat has already sailed.  I don't think it will ever be
possible to revise the ansi lisp standard to include graphics and
networking.  My own opinion is to bring lisp as close to C as possible
in regard to these missing items -- then we will be assured of some
longevity.  And I don't think we need to fret about the lack of
standardization here -- as long as we have one good open-source
compiler that will never go away and can be bent to our needs, that's
all we should ever want.  If I had to design all the C code I write to
work on gcc, icc, portland, .... my productivity would be destroyed --
gcc is good enough, and is not going away in my lifetime.  As far as
axiom goes, I'm far more interested in fixing math bugs and adding
math functionality, though clearly I haven't been contributing in this
area (yet).  I don't particularly care about SPAD vs. Aldor either --
as long as we have one language under our control that is open and
forever, I'm grateful.

Speaking of networking -- a Debian user just found a bug in our socket
code which has now been fixed in cvs, in case you want to update.

Take care,

>=20

I think it's very clear, thank you.

So, how can I tell of Xcode is installed? In particular, how
can I tell of Xcode is installed on the OS X system in the
SourceForge compile farm? The server is accessed via ssh command
line. The compile farm docs

http://sourceforge.net/docs/compile_farm

seem to be a little out of date since the

* ppc-osx1: Apple Mac OS X 10.1 Server with Fink running on an Mac G4
* ppc-osx2: Apple Mac OS X 10.2 Server with Fink running on an Mac G4

are no longer available but there is a system named ppc-osx3 running
OS X 10.3.

If both Xcope and Fink are installed, since this is a shared server
with no root access can you recommend a procedure that will ensure
that I do not inherit any Fink dependencies?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Xcode (the IDE and friends) is installed in "/Developer", so check  
for that directory.  However, as I said, Xcode is also the tool chain  
(gcc, dyld, ...), and those are what you want.  Especially when  
viewed from an ssh perspective, it should look, more or less, like  
any Unix system:
    gcc -v
will tell you what version of the compiler you have.

You can the version of the OS with "sw_version" (command-line).

The most straight-forward is to check your environment variables  
('env').  You don't want anything like "/sw/..." in any of them  
(e.g., PATH).

If the 10.3 system is not 10.3.9, then you may have some build  
problems with SAGE; ask here for help if things go sour.  I can try  
building things for you on my 10.4 systems if you want to verify that  
they work on a more recent system.

Hope that helps.

I think you want (null (pathname-name (truename filearg)))
or
(and (directory filearg) (not (probe-file filearg)))

Sorry, I still feel a little "dense" about this. Could you take
a minute to translate these two expressions for me? I want

 (if (... filearg)
   )

to be true if filearg is either a file *or* a directory.

I suspect that 2) requires that it be a directory and not a file
since 'probe-file' is now interpreted as specifically as testing
for a *file*. So maybe that one is not right?

I am also worried about the "wild-card" properties of 'directory'
which is not something I really want.

But I don't know the semantics of 1) at all, and having
consulted the lisp docs as deeply as possible, I am still
not sure. What exactly does expression 1) do on GCL?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Greetings!  Just checked out wxmaxima, and was wondering if an
interface to wxwindows from lisp would be useful/desirable.

Is there yet a consensus on the 'best' cross-platform graphics,
esp. wrt. gcltk/ltk?

Take care,

Camm, just so we know, what would be involved with getting McCLIM
working on GCL?  Has this been tried in recent history?  I guess on a
related note, does asdf work in the ANSI image now?

asdf works at least basically in gclcvs (aka 2.7.0) right now, and
possibly can be made to work with 2.6.8 ansi, I just haven't tried.  I
also have no experience with McCLIM, but if everyone signs off on this
being the 'one true way', I'll make sure it works.

Take care,

I would like to comment on Tom Boothby's vision of how a wiki
with an interface to Sage might be beneficial to the develop
of Sage as a software project. The intention, as I understand
it, would be to maintain a version the actual source code and
documentation for Sage as "pages" on the wiki. Changes to the
contents of source code pages modified by open access over the
web would become part of a live collaborative online test
environment. Plus a channel would be provided whereby these
changes could be selectively incorporated into the official
Sage distribution.

The wiki pages would also contain live Sage calculations -
such as is possible in the current NoteBook interface - that
could be used to incorporate illustrations of features and
issues in the documentation in a dynamic manner.

In fact the Axiom project has made the entire source code of
Axiom available over the web in precisely this way for the last
year. And has operated a wiki able to display the results of
Axiom calculations for more than two years. See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1

Axiom source code is written in a "literate programming" style
based on noweb and LaTeX called "pamphlets" which enables
"chunks" of source code to be named, referenced in discussion
in the text, and assembled into executable programs. The Axiom
wiki is able to store the source of each pamphlet as an object
embedded in an editable wiki page and to render it in various
document formats (dvi, pdf, ps) as well as extract code chunks
on demand.

Discussion and illustrative calculations can be freely attached
to wiki pages containing pamphlet objects.

As the chief designer of the web site that is currently used to
support Axiom, Tom's suggestions seem very welcome to me. But the
fact is that these features of the Axiom wiki web site have not
been extensively used to Axiom developers and users and remain
essentially only an experimental aspect of the web site.

In my opinion, scale is an essential and critical difference
between the Axiom and Sage wiki web sites and wikipedia. Our
experience on the Axiom wiki suggests that the ratio of the
number of active contributors to the number of people to the
total number of visitors our site is as high as 1 in 10,000 -
even including "mischievous edits". We do have 2 or 3 people
who regularly contribute. The number of visits per month is
nearly 10,000 the number of edits.

I think the whole reason for wikipedia's success is still
quite uncertain. But if wikipedia hosts say 1 million visits
per month, then this same ratio is approximately preserved.

I strongly disagree with this view. I don't think one can
usefully define "broken" and "stable" in this way. I would
claim instead that the "stability" and/or robustness of both
code and documentation is largely determined by two factors:

1) how accessible and visible they are, and

2) the extent to which authors and editors (and programmers)
   take responsibility for and identify with the content

Certainly one thing that is remarkable about wikipedia is the
response of wikipedia and it's contributors to instances of
"mischievous edits" (or worse). The integrity of the encyclopedia
is apparently being aggressively and effectively defended by
people who do not expect anything other than a small amount of
recognition for their contributions. The sense of "ownership"
is evident in how most people describe wikipedia. One might
even be inclined to suspect that "mischievous edits", when not
allowed to overrun the really interesting and reliable content
actually contributes to this sense of ownership.

Wouldn't it be great if we were able to harness some of this
human energy for the improvement of computer algebra systems!

This would be easy to accomplish and has been discussed on the
axiom-developer list, but not yet implemented. The simple reason
is that it does not seem urgent since almost no one has come
forward wishing to contribute to Axiom in this way. (The sole
exception being online editing of the Axiom Tutorial book.)

Yes, this has been done for example as an extension of the
Zope application layer on which the ZWiki engine using on the
Axiom website is based.

Yes, this is provided on the Axiom wiki via an "external editor"
function. After appropriately configuring their browsers, users
can click on an edit icon to cause the browser to launch an
editor on the user's workstation (such as emacs or some other)
with the contents of the wiki page. When the user issues a
editor command to save, the page is automatically uploaded to
the wiki. See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/ExternalEdit

In spite of the doubts that are raised in my mind by what I
consider to be only the limited success of the Axiom wiki
website when it comes to this approach over the last year, I
am still optimistic that with a sufficient number of motivated
people and with increasing experience of users with this type
of system, we might still be able to take advantage this
technology. I am glad that it is being considered and developed
for Sage.

This leads me to a perhaps radical but quite serious suggestion:

Here we are working on Moinmoin and ZWiki-based wiki web sites
for Sage and Axiom, but maybe we should really be spending some
time developing a MediaWiki interface for these systems ...
(MediaWiki is the software that is used to implement wikipedia.)
What I mean is, this sort of computer algebra system should be
available directly on wikipedia. I think for certain Sage (once
the Axiom interface for Sage is complete :) is a logical candidate
for such an extension of wikipedia given it's commitment to open
source software and the approach to integrating diverse packages
into a coherent user interface.

Wikipedia has a huge potential audience and a large contributor
base - even if we restrict our view to only the current mathematical
content. Although this might sound like a "bandwagon" kind of
strategy, I seriously think that we should consider approach
the wikipedia developers soon (that is assuming that no one has
already suggested this idea) rather than waiting for it to happen
is a less optimal way.

Of course there might be some reluctance given the computer
resource that might have to be dedicated to providing this
sort of user interface. Maybe at least initially we would need
to consider what "class" of wikipedia user/contributor would be
permitted access to the computational part of the system, i.e.
permitted to edit wiki pages contain such "live math".

I believe there are already systems such as this being
developed specifically to assist with mathematical education.
For example:

http://www.mathweb.org
http://www.mathsnet.net/mathview/index.html

I know there are more, both commercial and open source projects.
I'll have to look back through my notes.

Comments?

Regards,
Bill Page.

The reason I chose ZWiki initially is because MediaWiki (and many other
latex-in-wiki sytems) is very un-latex-like and very un-wiki like, and I
expected users who did not and would not learn STX or Wiki, but I wanted
to render their math in a reasonable way.  (i.e. as we often send each
other in email)

    http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Formula

The current LatexWiki meshes nicely with the pamphlet ideas and the
knowledge that scientists and mathemeticians have.  We all know we can
type $x^2$ and know what it means.  Learning to type <math>x^2</math> is
unexpected behavior, and throws one into learning HTML too.

This project already has too many languages.  We should be seeking to
reduce the set of languages.  Thereby we reduce the knowledge set needed
to contribute to Axiom.  Latex and pamphlets are two that are not going
away.  I think we should head for a pamphlet-based wiki instead.

What about DarwinPorts?

http://darwinports.opendarwin.org

Their advertisement sez:

"The DarwinPorts Project's main goal is to provide an easy
way to install various open-source software products on the
Darwin OS family (OpenDarwin, Mac OS X and Darwin)."

"Please note that in order to install and run DarwinPorts on
Mac OS X you must have Apple's Xcode installed, found at the
Apple Developer site or on your Mac OS X installation CDs/DVD."

"It's sort of like the FreeBSD ports collection ..."

Apparently GCL has already been ported:

http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/ports/?by=3Dname&substr=3Dgcl

"gcl 2.6.6
    GNU Common Lisp
    Maintained by: waqar@opendarwin.org
    Categories: lang
    Platforms: darwin
    Dependencies: gettext"

Since we already apparently have the ability to build Axiom on BSD
systems which (like Debian) starts with a pre-installed version of
GCL, perhaps this would be the straightest path to Axiom on OS X?

I wonder if the DarwinPorts GCL maintainer: 'waqar' would be willig
to give us some insight into the ease or difficulty of porting GCL
what might also apply to Axiom?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I'm afraid that no such event is likely :-(.  

Ah, well - I'll have a go and see if it compiles, at least.

Hi,
	I be glad to help with Axiom, but I have not used Axiom, so I have  
not tried
to compile it.

Couple of things to remember about gcl port, I have not updated to  
the latest release (2.6.7) and I have not compiled it on Intel  
machines yet, I will have to spend some time to verify that it works.

Thank you, thank you!

The main part of Axiom (the AXIOMsys computational "engine") is
built as a very large Lisp application on top of GCL plus a few
external subroutines written in C linked into the image.

The two other main parts of Axiom: Hyperdoc and Graphics, run
as separate processes, are written entirely in C and communicate
with AXIOMsys via sockets.

It should be possible to build Axiom using the older version
of GCL.

Anything you can do to help us with this would be greatly
appreciated! If you haven't already, you might want to visit
the Axiom developer website at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

to find out more about Axiom. If you have any questions and/or
suggestions, please let me know.

Thanks again, and "Welcome aboard!" :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi,

despite being busy and not reading the list regularly, I couldn't help
but notice the discussions about Lisp GUIs, especially the suggestions
to create Lisp FFI bindings to WxWidgets (formerly WxWindows, see
http://wxwidgets.org). I first present a short, non-exhaustive list of
Lisp GUI libraries that are free, portable and actively maintained. At
the end of this message there are a few thoughts on GUIs for Axiom.

- wxCL (http://www.wxcl-project.org/language/en/)

  Bindings for the WxWidgets library. Yes, they already
  exist. According to the developers they are in alpha state and
  should work on Mac OS X, Windows XP and Linux. They have only been
  tested on the former two, though.

  CFFI (http://cffi.common-lisp.net/project/cffi/) is used to abstract
  away the differences between different Lisp FFIs. CFFI is fully
  supported on almost all significant Lisps and OSs. See
  http://cffi.common-lisp.net/project/cffi/ for details.

- cells-gtk (http://cffi.common-lisp.net/project/cells-gtk/)

  Bindings for GTK using Kenny Tilton's Cells library
  (http://cffi.common-lisp.net/project/cells/), a portable CLOS
  dataflow extension, to ease GUI programming. Uses CFFI (see above).

- Celtk (http://www.tilton-technology.com/Celtk.html)

  Bindings for Tk using cells (see cells-gtk). OpenGL support.


- McClim (http://www.cliki.net/McCLIM)

  This library is still somewhat experimental and depends on X11 (even
  though there is an experimental Mac backend). Active developer
  community and interesting concepts, as well as a standard.

- lisp-cffi-qt4 (http://lisp-cffi-qt4.sourceforge.net/)

  Experimental CFFI bindings to QT4, the library that is used for KDE.


All the libraries mentioned above are in an early state. There are
rough edges and lots of missing functionality, but all of them look
promising. So far I've tried Cells-GTK (on OS X, doesn't run out of
the box) and McClim.

Now that I've presented a list of Lisp GUI libraries, let me argue
that it is irrelevant. 

I do not see any reason why a GUI for Axiom has to be written in
Lisp. Why not write a GUI for Axiom in Python or Java or C++? Why does
every GUI have to be portable? Why should there be only one GUI or
even a canonical GUI anyway?

Different people will want different GUIs. Tim Daly prefers a 'bare'
Emacs with all buffers in Fundamental Mode, whereas I love my Slime
and all the other bells and whistles. Martin Rubey wants to edit his
pamphlets using Emacs, other people can't stand Emacs. Some of the
latter sold their souls to the VI gods, others really want fancy
graphics and icons and toolbars. Finally some people prefer a portable
GUI, whereas others want really tight integration with their OS of
choice.

Trying to provide a single GUI making all these people happy is futile
at best, probably insane and certainly an awful lot of work.

The solution is to separate the GUI from the Axiom core and make GUI
programming easier. The former is pretty easy, just get rid of the GUI
code in $AXIOM/src. That would also get rid of most of the C code and
thereby improve portability of the core. Making GUI programming easier
is a lot more work.

For a GUI to be more useful than an Axiom terminal session, it needs
to be able to understand Axiom's output to some extent. It also needs the ability to
query Axiom for all kinds of information, eg

- list all existing variables/functions/types/commands/loaded libraries/etc
- list all functions/commands that are either of a given type or applicable to a given object
- where is the documentation for this library/function/command/etc?
- where is the source code for a given function?
- show me all functions/libraries that call/are called by function/library X
- in debugging mode: supply a stack trace

Create an API that supports this kind of functionality and future
versions of itself, and make it available over a socket using a simple
(in every programming language) clear-text protocol. Done. Sooner or
later someone will write a GUI then.


Kai

Ok, I looked at the page, and to build it seems pretty simple, since  
it uses configure script., If you want to you can install MacPorts  
and install gcl and try to build axiom on the mac and see if it builds.
I will give it a try later today, as I have class that I need to  
attend this morning.

Perhaps I wasn't clear. I am not trying to create any kind of GUI.
I'm trying to make a portable front end for the graphics code.

My experience with many years of porting, which makes up probably
half of my career, is that C programs are probably the least portable.
This is especially true of C programs that draw lines.

Lisp programs are amazingly portable. It took all of 5 minutes to move
my work project (a 20k+ line lisp porgram) from Linux to Windows. 

I'm looking for a way to draw a colored line in a window on all of
the existing platforms from Lisp. Given this I can re-implement the
graphics portion of Axiom and make it run everywhere.

I need a lisp program that can open a window on Linux and Windows
and draw a colored line using common code. Surely this must be possible.

All of the required patches are in zips.
Just set the GCLVERSION variable to match the GCL version,
put the gcl-version.tgz file in zips, set the AXIOM shell
variable, and type make.

I believe that is an excellent suggestion.

This approach is already partially used in Maxima to abstract the
user interface from TeXmacs. I recently used an only slightly
modified version of the interface code written by James Amundson

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima#msg20060810023214-0500@wik
i.axiom-developer.org

in the new MathAction Wiki interface for Maxima. The TeXmacs
interface uses embedded control codes but I changed this to an
XML-style bracketing that was very easy to parse in Python.

For more Maxima examples see:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima2

---------

Interfacing to Axiom actually presents a little more of a
challenge than Maxima because we also need to deal separately
with the type information. And as you suggested above, error
messages, state-of-the-computation information and graphical
data should also be handled through a consistent and well
documented clear text protocol.

The protocol and API also needs to be designed to work well with
asynchronous AJAX-style techniques for browser interaction.

The Sage developers have been discussing
Twisted http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ and
Nevow http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow as appropriate
related interface technologies.

I think that if we can graft these methods into the Lisp side
of AXIOMsys, then we would be in a very good position when
"Sooner or later someone writes the next GUI application".

Bill Page.

As far as drawing graphs, why not just dump out a graph in any kind of
portable format (e.g. postscript, pdf, svg, etc).  A front-end can parse
it and display it.  There are many relevant lisp libraries:

Hmmm. If you ever get a chance, maybe you could try this trick
with Kai Kaminski's AxiomUI code? :) It's written entirely in
Lisp (except for the Javascript part on the web browser), uses
some standard common lisp packages and runs on Clisp in Linux.
But on our first (and only) attempt neither Kai nor I were able
to get it to run on Windows.

Bill Page.

Alfredo,

On Thursday, September 07, 2006 1:00 PM you asked:

> Can you tell me where I can checkout the source of Kai's=20
> AxiomUI (svn, darcs..).

See

darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom--GUI--1

and in the tla archive as 'axiom-GUI--1'. Everything except the
standard common lisp components are also available here as online
pamphlets:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--GUI--1

Here are a couple of related references from the axiom-developer
list at the time Kai completed this work:

You were clear, and what really triggered my post was the assumption
that there were no Lisp bindings for WxWidgets.

This comment begs the question though, why displaying graphics
shouldn't be the responsibility of the GUI. I believe that Axiom
should just tell the GUI 'look, your last command prompted me to
create a plot. Here is the list of points and here are the additional
options the user supplied (eg. line style, point style, colors
etc)'. Then the GUI should make sure that the plot somehow gets
displayed. A simple one might just pipe the whole load to gnuplot,
another one might have a fancy plot window.

If what you write above is really what you want, Tk should do the
trick. There are several Tk interfaces for Lisp, the most portable is
probably Ltk (http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/). It also consists of
pretty much one file, so it's easy to LOAD and to handle.

I just tried to run it under GCL, but it didn't work. I'm not yet sure
why. The only non-portable part of it seems to be the function that
calls the WISH interpreter, which is part of Tk. Changing that should
be easy enough, but GCL chokes on some conditions-related stuff. I'll
take a closer look.

Kai

Just a minute ago I revisited the Maxima mailing list archives and
found the following two messages supporting my point of view to some
extent:

http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2004/008349.html

  Argues that the output of Maxima shouldn't just be 'textual chatter'
  that the other end (a GUI or another tool) has to sort through. He
  calls this the 'stone age approach', and that's what it is.

  Unlike him I believe TCP sockets are nicer for communication than
  CORBA, but that's a detail. Just like the choice of XML, SEXPs, JSON
  or some other scheme for encoding the information that Axiom exchanges
  with the GUI.

http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2004/008303.html

  Argues for a clear separation of the GUI from the computational
  engine.

Kai

DarwinPorts is in the same class as Fink: it is something that you  
should not rely on.  It may well be worth using what the DarwinPorts  
maintainers have discovered about building GCL on Mac OS X (as we  
have done in the past with Singular and Macaulay2, from Fink), but  
you can't rely on, and I think, force upon the SAGE user, the use of  
anything from DarwinPorts itself.

Since Waqar is now involved, this may be a moot point :-}

In Axiom, displaying graphics IS the clear responsibility of the GUI.
Axiom has a completely standalone graphics package (you can run it
directly, it's called viewAlone). 

I need to port viewAlone to many platforms. *MY* preference is to 
do it in lisp.

Because there is a difference between the plot data and the resulting
plot and producing the latter from the former isn't easy. The plot
contains all kinds of objects like grid lines, axis, a title etc. This
implies that we need tons of plotting code inside the core of
Axiom. The plot data that Axiom produces should be an easily parseable
description of the points/lines/surfaces that are to be displayed, as
well as all additional options that the user supplied, like colours,
axis etc.

As for the GUI, different people will prefer different plotters
(layout, output formats, ...).

While I agree that it is desirable to have Axiom be as easy as possible
to interface with from a GUI standpoint, I disagree that there
shouldn't be a canonical Axiom GUI.  This does not, please note, mean
that I think there should be ONLY one GUI for Axiom - people should be
free to make as many GUIs as they want.  The observation that different
people will want (and be more productive in) different environments is
quite correct.  However, there should be one GUI that is designed to be
the "default" GUI for Axiom.

For both Maple and Mathematica, there is one GUI which is designed to
offer an intelligent, organized way to deal with mathematical problems,
objects, and documents.  In each case this GUI is the "public face" of
the program and serves as both a convenient tool for document
formatting and as visual evidence of the effort put into making the
product a "finished, polished tool."  It is a re-assurance (however
potentially false) that work has gone into making sure that the user
won't have to deal with problems that programmers would normally deal
with.

I won't argue with those who will point out that this doesn't mean
anything about how good the mathematical abilities of the software are
- indeed, I agree with them.  But for those who will evaluate Axiom as
a tool to use, the metrics they will be using in some form are:

1.  Does this project look like a serious, able, and high quality
production?
2.  How friendly is it to use to do what I need to do?
3.  How much time will it take me to learn enough with this tool to
become productive?

It takes enough time and energy to evaluate a tool such as Axiom in a
non-trivial way that the motivation to do so must be extreme.  (How
many people here have seen a sub-optimal tool used simply because
people already knew it and thought it would be faster to use that tool
instead of learn one they knew might be better?)

For serious research, this may not be a problem.  Axiom has a very
strong foundation, and there are very probably lots of projects where
the time spent learning Axiom will pay off well enough to motivate
people to learn it, GUI or not.  Many more, however, will not be that
motivated.

I would personally prefer that there exist a GUI for Axiom that is
designed by the same people who are intimately familiar with the system
itself, and (for example) might be able to teach a graphical
environment to associate type information with graphical behavior in
the GUI.  (Imagine, for example, a GUI that would let someone drag a
polynomial into an integration template but would refuse a matrix as an
incompatible type.  Or a formula template for ballistic motion that
would reject anything with the wrong type in its slots.  The visual
display may or may not contain all of the important information for the
user, but a GUI working with the type system itself could be far more
intelligent.)  My guess is 3rd party graphical systems are not likely
to be interested in this type of work, preferring instead to simply use
Axiom as a mathematical engine to get answers to common problems.  

I think it would be desirable for people who download and install
Axiom, when they type "axiom" or click their Axiom icon, to have a GUI
environment available that is similar in concept to the Maple and
Mathematica environments, but perhaps with more or different
functionality.  Our "first impression" with potential users is what
they see when they start the program, and I would personally like there
to be a smooth, polished, and professional GUI as our first foot
forward.

Of course, someone would need to create such an environment, and code
always speaks louder than emails.  I have looked at these issues a
little bit and will attempt to pursue them further, but I know the
problem is significant.  I guess it boils down to this:

1.  I think a default GUI for Axiom would be a Very Good Thing
2.  The project is not yet a a point where this should be a major focus
for the project as a whole.
3.  The work to make Axiom more friendly to ALL GUIs should be more
important, because it will be useful to a very broad spectrum of
applications.  (Indeed, even the command prompt probably should work
off of the same API some day.)
4.  Code counts more than opinions, so I'll be quiet until I have more
of the former ;-).

Cheers,
CY

Greetings!  I take it this discussion is regarding OSX support.
Great!

If memory serves, one of the gcl developers got this working with a
more recent release.  Am cc'ing him in hope he might have some
comment/be able to offer help.

Supposedly, 2.6.8pre compiles on OSX 'out of the box' -- at least the
ACL2 people have told me it worked for them.

Never understood the relationship between fink, darwinports, and
macports ...

There are OSX specific bfd patches in the gcl source tree.  It would
be wonderful to get these accepted into binutils upstream someday -- I
haven't gotten around to asking about it.

Take care,

Bob, have you changed your mind on this issue since we discussed
it last year? :)

BTW, when I was looking in the archives, I noticed some more
"lost comments" about the use of HTTP as an Axiom user interface
protocol as mentioned in a different but related thread:

I am inclined to agree with Kai, but for reasons different than
the ones I would have sited last year. Specifically, in the
development of Sage I see a "real life" example of the benefits
the modular approach. This does not just apply between the
computational "engine" and the graphical user interface, but
actually extends deeper into methods of computation and outward
into various modes of presentation of the same data for different
purposes. From my point of view Sage gets a lot of mileage out of
being able to mix and match the features of many different open
source computer algebra systems. The more modular they are, the
more flexible the integration between them can be.

But Sage takes a somewhat different large-scale "object-oriented"
view. When maxima returns an object to a variable at the Sage
command level, that complex strongly-typed object inherits a
number of properties and methods from it's parent. In the case of
a Maxima expression, at least one of these methods plots a graph.
But this is just an external interface to some graphics function
internal to Maxima. For example another method might involve
Maxima's symbolic integration or differentiation operations.

And just like in Axiom, objects can often be coerced or converted
from one class (domain) into another where they might inherit
quite a different set of methods and properties, for example
as a polynomial in Singular or a graph in gnuplot. So this is
not modularity for it's own sake but rather because we really
need to be able to perform these conversions as efficiently
and flexibly as possible. If the graphic data from Axiom was
represented only as a postscript file, it might be very
difficult to convert that to a form that could be scaled by a
graphic method in gnuplot.

Long ago at the end of the previous century when Axiom was
younger and the developers more optimistic ... ;) ... Axiom
had a virtual reality graphics interface called OpenInventor.
In fact this was part of the Texplorer browser integration
which was lost to us by corporate decision making. But you
can still see the vestiges of that marriage in the existing
instrumentation in the Axiom library graphics code. (Ref.
Mike Dewar discussed this briefly on this list almost 4 years
ago!)

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-04/msg00132.ht
ml

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2002-11/msg00142.html

OpenInventor is still there and it's still open source:

http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/license.html

and has a lot of excellent documentation.

But it's real status as open source seems a bit in doubt since
it seems that an enhanced version is being sold as closed source
by a company called Mercury http://www.tgs.com ?

Wikipedia to the rescue ;)

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Inventor

So now OpenInventor exists as "Coin3d"

  http://www.coin3d.org/
  http://www.coin3d.org/licensing

with dual GPL and commercial licensing!

Still confused? I am. It's hard to think of a better example
of the peculiar dynamics between proprietary and open source
software development!

Anyway, I wonder if having taken him apart, we could somehow
manage to put humpty-dumpty back together again? :)

Regards,
Bill Page.

My apologies -- I thought you just wanted a directory.  So both of the
above are wrong.

truename is required to return an error if the path does not exist.
So you might not want this.  

I think we might still be deviating from the spec on directory a bit.
Even though we pass all the ansi tests.  At the moment, the best I can
think of is

(or (probe-file filearg) (= 1 (length (directory filearg))))

We can change this if it is deemed insufficient, and/or add a si::stat
function. 

The pathnames returned by truename or directory, etc., are structures
with components:

device
directory
name
type

The second is a list of components, which can include keywords
:current, :absolute, etc.  It can also be nil, which gives the
default, i.e. current working dir.  Pathnames corresponding to
directories have nil in the last two slots, and have corresponding
namestrings ending in "/".  Unfortunately, as you state, directory at
present has a certain globbin/pattern matching behavior which is not
so useful in this context.  Again, we can likely change this if
needed.

Take care,

Yes, I'm wondering why they are kept in GCL and not put in upstream.
I would suspect that binutils maintainers would be glad to have them.
Could you say more about the issues around its non-presence in upstream?

I'm not sure how these objectives depend on the existence of a
canonical user interface. Besides what looks great to the beginning
student might look like a toy to a researcher. What looks great to the
latter might look like a pile of unintellegible crap to the former.

The tool doesn't change, only the GUI. Do you know any other
successful language that has a canonical GUI? Certainly not C/C++,
Java, Smalltalk, Lisp, Python, Ruby, Fortran.

I certainly hope that implementing the two examples you give doesn't
require one to be an Axiom expert. Why do you assume that 3rd parties
are not interested in developing powerful GUIs? Non of the free Lisp
implementations has an IDE and most people are using Slime, which is
just great (even though not nearly perfect).

Why can't you provide this experience without a canonical GUI? Linux
doesn't have a canonical GUI, it doesn't even have any standard
software. That's why mere mortals don't just download the kernel, but
instead install Ubuntu, or whatever the latest hip Linux distribution
is (I don't mean to disparage Ubuntu, as far as I know it's a fine
system).

As I said, I'm not convinced.

That depends on what you mean. I believe the most important thing is
to make it developer friendly. In particular we must be able to use
all the open source Lisp libraries that are available. Also, writing
tools (especially GUIs) for Axiom should be easy.

It most certainly should.

I'm not so sure about that. How can anyone start coding if there is no
consent of what the core of Axiom is and what features it should offer
to GUIs?

Finally I'd be interested in how we could get such a canonical GUI. I
see two ways, each of which has its fair share of problems.

1) We discuss what features the GUI should have and what modifications
   to Axiom's core are necessary. Then some poor soul starts coding
   and after some time (probably measured in years) we end up with the
   canonical GUI as the Axiom gods ordered it (that's us).

   What if it fails for whatever reason? What if some third party
   builds a GUI that is much more attractive to users than the
   canonical one? Look at GNU Hurd and Linux. I seem to remember that
   Hurd is the 'canonical' GNU OS. Does anyone care?

2) We modify the Axiom core to allow easy development of GUIs. People
   start building them, first simple, then more involved ones. We pick
   the 'best'.

   What if two years later a different GUI is much better? Do we
   change the canonical GUI? For how long does it have to be the
   better one?


Finally let me point out that there really is no best GUI. On Mac OS X
the perfect GUI must support AppleScript and satisfy the expectations
of Mac users, who are very picky about UI design. Recently I witnessed
a discussion about the subtle differences between a window's
maximize/close button on OS X and Windows.

Since a single GUI might support several system at once (see Bill's
work), why not turn the whole thing upside-down? People download
bundles consisting of a single GUI and several cores (Axiom, GAP,
whatever).

Kai

PS: I don't mean to say that there shouldn't be a nice, downloadable
package on Axiom's website featuring a specific GUI. What I'm after is
independence. Axiom's main branch should contain no GUI-related code
other than the implementation of the Axiom<->GUI protocol.

Yes. I prefer the (si:stat filearg) function:

  nil if no file or directory exists,  otherwise some
  list of useful info and keywords (like Unix?)

The non-nil return might not be so standard between systems
but who really cares?

The following long boring chain of messages between the experts:

convinces me that your suggestion is the best idea so far! :-)

	So that means we need to bump the port to the latest source and take  
it from there. I just tried to compile GCL 2.6.6 and 2.6.7 on 10.4.7  
and it failed, I will see what is going on and at least update the  
port to build correctly.

	DarwinPorts was renamed to MacPorts after recent shutdown of the  
OpenDarwin. Fink is a separate porting environment. You only need one  
or the other, they pretty much do the same thing. There might be  
differences in number and kind of ports.

SLIME is quite good, but I'm not sure the cases are comparable.  If you
look around, I think you will find that there are few to no open source
mathematical environments that approach Mathematica's notebook
interface.  Texmacs probably comes the closest of any I am familiar
with, but it is not tightly integrated with the mathematical
environment.  Some, like wxMaxima, are nice and quite functional but I
think we should strive to have a GUI the way Axiom strives to be a CAS
- to be a solution so good that using it is a no-brainer.  Study all
existing solutions, find the best features of them all, research it
(there is existing work on the topic that is quite academic in nature),
and then design the interface using literate programming techniques. 
To me Lisp makes sense as the language of the GUI because that is also
the foundational language Axiom is written in.

There are arguments that it suffers because of this, particularly from
the standpoint of those looking to offer commercial software on Linux. 
I admit I don't know, since the only way to find out is to try, but I
suspect that developing a top notch CAS GUI will require those familiar
with Axiom itself to be deeply involved in the process.

Agreed.  But it does result in effort being diffused over many
distributions and many parallel efforts.  This is the nature of open
source and definitely allows for new features to be tried, so I don't
decry it - but I hope that new and advanced features of mathematical
GUIs could be incorporated into a unified, powerful environment for
Axiom instead of having the user forced to sacrifice one feature or
another depending on their choice of GUI.  (Minimalistic interfaces
aside, of course - there the whole point is to have fewer features.)

Right.  What I ment was we shouldn't be (as a project) worrying about
GUI design when we can't run on ANSI lisp yet.

Well, that's a bit different.  What we should expose to GUIs and how is
probably somewhat separate from how the GUIs use that information.  The
latter is usually where most of the trouble comes in :-).

:-).  I'm beginning to think that most really high quality software
does take years.  TeX, Axiom, BrlCAD...

Well, if what I have heard about Lisp holds true in GUI programming it
should be fairly hard for anybody to create a feature we can't
incorporate one way or another ;-).  The idea of a literate GUI program
should be that it is first about ideas, and second about the
implementation of those ideas.  If we do it right and cover most of the
key elements of such programs from the beginning (and there are many
similar elements) then further extensions of the core functionality
should be managable.  From my standpoint, the key problems are:

1.  2-D interactive mathematical display and formatting, particularly
line breaking and font interactions.  Probably the hardest single part.

2.  2 and 3-D plotting, interactive manipulation, etc.  IZIC has done
some work that I like, and VTK is also very nice - adapting those ideas
and some work that has been done on how to do high quality mathematical
plotting is probably the second hardest part, or even hardest if we
also cover the core algorithms for graphical display and manipulation
ourselves.

3.  IO in various formats.  TeX, LaTeX, openmath, MathML, a file
storage format for Axiom notebooks, Word's equation editor and doc
format, pdf (particularly the interesting new trick of embedding movies
and objects you can interact with).  Communications protocals between
GUI and Axiom core also fall in here.  Here's an interesting one - if
we need to run the Axiom core without a multi-threaded lisp, how do we
stop a job that is running too long?  Killing it is a bit drastic,
since that also loses us any other computations done before, but what
alternatives are there?

4.  Global document structure - in some ways, a Mathematical GUI must
also be a document processor.  Mathematica certainly is.  How do we
handle that issue?  What typesetting engines are available, and which
are suited for interactive work?

That's why I prefer we have our own, that takes good ideas wherever
they are found and incorporates them.

Yes, it's quite tricky.  My understanding was CLIM was developed in
part to abstract as much of that as possible, although lack of back
ends to GUI libraries sort of limits that potential at the moment.  In
some respects I think the CLIM design was even more ambitious than that
of Java's GUI libraries - the designers wanted the possiblity of native
looks on all supported platforms using native widgets, when available. 
Of course, that's a bit hard in practice and would require a fairly
universal FFI (hence my interest in the CFFI project.)

Because those systems, fundamentally, are not designed to work
together.  I admire the SAGE effort and I think it will be very useful,
but GAP (for example) doesn't share Axiom's type system and so there is
an impediance mismatch between the two systems.  What assumptions is
GAP making that Axiom doesn't know about when it solves a problem, and
are those assumptions ones that are compatible with the ones we would
make?  Does a function name or even a property name mean the same thing
between the two systems?  If we evolve towards proving algorithms, how
do we prove an algorithm used in GAP without doing enough work to go
ahead and implement it in Axiom anyway?

Well, maybe.  But I think there should be an axiom-gui tree as well
that has the "official" Axiom GUI, which the Axiom project keeps in
sync with any changes to the Axiom core.  And when we build the
complete "system" we should build axiom-gui as well.  We already build
the Hyperdoc program, after all, and that is part of the default
system.  I'd rather have axiom-gui as a directory in the toplevel axiom
branch, and have a ./configure --without-gui option if one doesn't want
it.  When I type .configure  make  make install and then run "axiom" I
would kind of expect the GUI to be the default.

Cheers,
CY

I think it is simple lack of followup on my part with the binutils
developers.  If you would like to isolate the patch and craft an
email, that would be most helpful!

Building build-improvements branch fails without alredy installed
noweb.  Namely, confugure detects that noweb is absent and then
proceeds further. But the Makefile variable TANGLE is unset, which
causes build failure before building noweb (in fact, it looks that
noweb is not built at all).

Thanks. Maybe we can just agree that having an API/protocol to the
Axiom core is useful anyway and then implement that. That way we avoid
the discussion about wether we need a canonical GUI or not. The
existence of a well-designed API seems to be a good idea anyway.

I'll try to put up a wiki page for collecting design proposals, use
cases, etc. Furthermore I'll try to document those parts of Axiom that
are directly related to this effort (plotting code, database access,
documentation access, access to the interpreter/compiler etc).

Tim, I don't have admin privilege for mailing lists; can you look into
this, please?

Waldek, please send me (gdr at acm.org) the config.log from the build

Axiom isn't a language perse, but it incorporates Spad/Aldor, which is
one (two actually) and offers an interpreter. How is that different
from Lisp, Haskell, ML or any other programming language that offers
an interactive environment?

Wouldn't you expect the average user of Axiom to write at least little
programs/libraries?

You seem to suggest that we are better suited to built a powerful,
complex GUI than the community at large. I don't believe that.

I don't know why TeXmacs isn't as tightly integrated with any
mathematical environment as you'd wish. I *do* know, though, that it
would be fairly hard to integrate it closely with Axiom, because Axiom
is somewhat 'unfriendly' to programs. If anyone feels that this claim
should be substantiated I'll happily give a few examples.

I disagree with this on several counts. First of all this looks like
the waterfall model to me. Figure out what we want, implement it, be
happy. The problem is that we don't even know what we want, and we'll
never figure that out without writing some GUI code.

Why does a GUI need literate programming? Correctness in the GUI isn't
nearly as important as in the mathematical core. Besides, literate
programming is an investment in the future. GUI code often doesn't
have much of a future, since things change rapidly. Especially the
first few GUI attempts will be so bad that people will throw them
away, anyway. That shouldn't stop anyone from using LP if so inclined.

I don't understand the connection between the implementation languages
of Axiom and (one of) its GUIs at all. The only good thing that would
come out of writing the GUI in Lisp in that regard is that the GUI
could run in the same Lisp image as Axiom (that would require
multi-threading, by the way, unless you're prepared to let your GUI
stall for hours at a time). That would spare us the burden of defining
a network protocol and we might even do without a proper API to the
core by just letting the GUI code dig around in the bowels of Axiom.
While that is tempting I strongly believe that it is important to
make building GUIs in any language as easy as possible.

Someone who isn't at least somewhat familiar with Axiom or CAS in
general probably wouldn't attempt to write a GUI for it (oh, the
irony). The only things that require deep Axiom knowledge are the
specification and implementation of the Axiom/GUI protocol. Writing a
top notch GUI requires GUI design skills and an end user perspective.

Besides I never argued that Axiom's core developers shouldn't be
involved with the development of one or more GUIs. I'm not convinced
though, that they'll produce the best GUI possible. Furthermore I'm
confident that they have more important things to do. To rephrase that
argument: Many people can do GUI development, but only very few can
work on Axiom's internals. It sure isn't a good idea then, to have the
Axiom experts hacking on the GUI.

Parallel efforts are great! Suppose there was one true Linux. Do you
believe that all the people who work on specific distributions now
would then instead work on the one true version? Also what if there
are two really cool features which you can't support at the same time?

Exactly. By making GUI development easy other people who can't or
don't want to work on the more pressing problems (ANSIfication,
Spad/Aldor, elimination of BOOT [that one's for you, Bill ;-)] etc)
can start working on GUIs. Later, when the more imminent problems have
been solved, we can look at the existing GUIs and figure out where to
go from there. Why should GUI development have to wait until
everything else has been taken care of?

It is indeed very different. Of course, the former should be guided by
the latter. Since we don't really know what a great GUI should look
like, we'll have to take some educated guesses and then wait for
feedback.

Sure. Most great software is the result of evolution, though. Another
argument why we shouldn't be too picky about the quality of early GUI
code. This in turn means that the GUI code shouldn't live in Axiom's
main branch, or in any Axiom branch at all.

That doesn't imply that it's a good idea. Besides you have to consider
library issues. Despite Lisp's greatness as a language, there isn't
good support for native Cocoa (Mac) user interfaces. In fact it's not
even clear that there ever will be. On Windows there is an effort for
a native GUI library, but it's still in alpha as far as I know (google
for 'graphics-forms'). Even if that succeeds you might be better off
with Visual Basic (as sad as that is).

I claim that you won't have the right idea without actually writing
code. Some features look great in theory, but don't work out in
practice. It is notoriously hard to predict these things. Hence the
'design first - code later' method will break down.

This is of interest to other people as well
(eg. cl-typesetting). Thus it should be done in a separate general
purpose library (eg. cl-typesetting).

That's been done for other languages already. It would be cool to have
a flexible plotting library in Lisp. But it's a waste of time write
now. There are good offerings in other languages, so just use
them. The Python Matplotlib source is about 30,000 lines, if I recall
correctly. Do you really want to recreate that effort for the sake of
purity? I don't.

I reckon that most of this should be the responsibility of external
tools, not the Axiom core itself.

For starters we could just use a multi-threaded Lisp. If that fails we
might be able to use Unix signals (or an equivalent mechanism) and
several processes. In the beginning we might have to live with an
Axiom that doesn't behave very well.

Depends on the GUI. Not everyone wants to write articles using his
CAS. Some people just want to calculate a few integrals every now and
then. Those GUIs that want to do document processing will figure out a
way to do it. That problem isn't really specific to Axiom.

And is always last on new developments, and looks like a random
collection of CAS GUI features.

Just because you use two CASs from the same GUI doesn't imply that
they'll have to work together. In my Emacs I use Common Lisp and
Haskell, which don't understand each other either. On the other hand
this whole point isn't that important, so let's ignore it for now.

That would mean that not all GUIs are created equal. There will always
be tricks the official GUI can do, that other GUIs aren't capable
of. If the Axiom core has a new feature that requires it to break
compatibility with older GUI versions, will the release of that feature
have to wait for the official GUI to catch up? Even if alternative
GUIs already support it?

In my view the GUI should take care of presenting the documentation as
well. No separate HyperDoc program. Of course, nothing stops you from
building a terminal-like UI and supply a separate HyperDoc with that.


I have the impression that there are quite a few things that we just
won't agree on. Since my arguments are often based on speculation I'm
not really willing to push them much harder. Maybe we could instead
try to find a common ground. How about the following:

1) In the Axiom core we create one or more additional Lisp packages
   (in the DEFPACKAGE sense) that provide an API for all the services
   that a GUI needs/wants/whatever.

   The most important feature would probably be to get the output from
   textual chatter to something with more structure.

2) We add a *small* and *simple* piece of code that exports that API
   over a socket interface. We also add a commandline option to enable
   this feature/configure the port/etc.

For display only I think there are three possibilities:

* use OutputForm directly

* use TEX

* create a domain like TEX that takes something in OutputFrom and converts it
  to whatever you want

For input and reusing output you should probably extend INFORM. If the type of
a result of a computation doesn't have INFORM, you should complain to the
author of the domain, or realize that it would be very very hard to come up
with an INFORM.

To obtain the domain of computation 101 you can use domainOf(%%(101))

And I still strongly believe that it would be wise to extend Ralf's ALLPROSE to
become a full-featured GUI. You really should look at the stuff tex4ht
produces, i.e., try

make html

in any ALLPROSE project (for example MyAlps, that comes with the ALLPROSE
distribution)

(you have to have tex4ht installed, of course)

Tim, did you change the password on the 'Axiom-testresults'
email list?

Gaby, I have seen this same problem recently while trying
build.improvements on various machines on the SourceForge compile
farm and on my own hardware. I recall that you said that the
branch would be "broken" for a while since you were in the
process of making even more radical improvements, so I did
not mention it yet.

As a work-a-round it seems to be possible to specify

  make noweb

to force noweb to be built first.

The reason why Waldek Hebisch's message was held is simply because he
is not subscribed to the 'Axiom-testresults' email list. Because spam
is such a terrible problem on these lists, requiring user registration
is the only way to prevent abuse. The list manager software has an option
to bounce email from non-subscribers to the list administrator. I look
after the axiom-developer, axiom-mail, axiom-legal, and axiom-math lists.
We get several hundred spam messages a day to these lists!

You are listed as a full project administrator for Axiom on Sourceforge:

Project Administrators:

Bill Page 		billpage
Tim Daly 		daly
Gabriel Dos Reis 	dos-reis

with the same rights as both Tim and I:

At http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=48359

after logging in you should see:

Your Permissions:

  You are listed as a project administrator for this project.
  You can perform ALL project operations.

If not, let me know.

axiom-testresults@lists.sf.net is an email list. So go here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/admin/lists_forums.php?group_id=48359

or more specifically:

http://sourceforge.net/mail/admin/index.php?group_id=48359&change_status=1

and then on to

https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/admin/axiom-testresults

to change list options. Here you get stopped unless you know

'List Administrator Password'

I thought this password was the same as the other lists, but I just
tried it and it doesn't work, so I guess not. :( The password can be
easily changed by any one of us, but it wasn't me. Tim?

Anyway, once you get there, on the above page you can set the
options so that you will receive bounce messages from postings by
non-subscribers to this list. That will allow you to intercept
and approve messages such as the one from Waldek.

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I would like to see the Axiom-testresults list require less stringent
subscription rules.  It is there for encouraging people to send build
logs, test results for Axiom -- they are not required  to read or
receive message from that list.  It is mainly useful for us
developers.  I understand the spam issue; I feel there ought to be a
way to handle it without requiring people to subscribe.  At GCC, we
manage to have all lists (except gcc-announces) freely open to people,
yet the spam rate is very very low.

One thing I would suggest is a simple ./configure && make using cvs
branch 2.6.8pre.  Same should work for 2.6.7 if memory serves.  2.6.8
is (hopefully) days away, and just awaits a few more Debian
autobuilders.  

Also wanted to mention that there is still one important GCL feature
missing on this port, stratified garbage collection, or SGC, which
relies on trapping addresses from segfaults caused by write attempts
to read only pages as a GC accelerator.  Aurelien had this working at
one point, then something changed with some macosx release, so it is
currently disabled.  Would be great to resolve this.  I can offer
email help if desired.

Take care,

Right.  I think we probably can make a reasonable guess though.

I think we will probably need to be involved with that, but we will

Eventually, yes I do.  Existing work should be used as a guide, but I
think the eventual goal should be a plotting library so
good/robust/capable that it makes no sense to use anything else.  I
agree right now it is not a priority.

I didn't say ONLY incorporated other ideas, or to incorporate all ideas
willy nilly.  Plus, how many really new features have appeared in CAS
work over the last 20 years?

I would argue yes.  I think once we become a mature project the GUI
should be as much a part of providing a good environment as good
documentation.  I can see your point, but how often would such a change
happen in a major way that would break the official GUI and still allow
alternative GUIs to support it faster than the official one? 
Particularly if both the API and the GUI itself are well designed.

Makes sense to me.  I would prefer to see Axiom make much better use of
the package system in Lisp, but apparently that will require some
design consideration since the original development pre-dates the
advent of common lisp packages.

Yes.

Definitely.

GUI issues are fine but unrelated to my original goal.



I see a tectonic shift in the computational math area (at least
from my limited view of the world).

There is a rising tide of discrete and computational geometry,
indeed a rise of geometric rather than algebraic approaches
that I see.

Axiom does not have any of the computational algebra support
and I've been pondering ways to address this.

Along the way the issue arises about how to handle the graphics.
Currently the graphics does not really support concepts like
infinite tilings. You could do this in a pointwise manner but
shouldn't have to do that.




Additionally I have another area which I see nowhere else
which is visual support for algorithms and data structures.

I want to be able to define an isomorphism between a data structure
and a graph and have that automatically displayed and updated.

For example, a list object and a tree structured graph so that
changges to the list modify the tree picture BUT ALSO changes
to the tree picture modify the list structure in memory. Thus you
would be able to manipulate your program from the graphics.

These abilities would be so much easier to construct if they
were implemented in common lisp and running as axiom programs.




So I'm looking for a lisp package that can draw colored lines
(of which colored points are a subset) in a window. IF I can
get both input and output thru the window I can build the
ideas envisioned above.

I tried that, however still a lot of breakage remains:

1) `TANGLE' and `WEAVE' in the main makefile remain unset (I changed
    them by hand to `notangle' and `noweave')

2) in `document' script the `tangle' and `weave' variables are unset
   changing their value to `$TANGLE' and `$WEAVE' does not help (I set
   them to `notangle' and `noweave')

3) in interp directory build fails at first step -- again looks like
   unset `$TANGLE' is unset (missing export somewhere ???)

Hi,

[...]

| configure:2934: checking for notangle
| configure:2963: result: no
| configure:2969: checking for noweave
| configure:2998: result: no

configure detects that noweb is missing.  That is fine.

[...]

| NOTANGLE=''
| NOWEAVE=''

However, this is not right.  It is the consequence of a bogus logic I
knew of but failed to fix before commit. 
It is now fixed.  Sorry for that.

Indeed.  That is a known bug with GCL :-(
I had a fix for Axiom in one of my many local trees and I can't find
right now. To prevent Axiom from using the system-installed GCL, you
might want to add --without-gcl when configuring Axiom.

The above GCL bug is quite intriguing and curious.  I hope to have a
fix for it before 2.6.8 is shipped.

Thanks for your patience.

Tried build using --without-gcl. Now build fails much earlier:

gcc -c -Wall -DVOL=volatile -fsigned-char -pipe -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer  -I/home/s/test/tt/axiom4/build-improvements/lsp/gcl-2.6.8pre/o -I../h -I../gcl-tk fat_string.c

fat_string.c:231: error: syntax error before 'bfd_combined_table_update'
fat_string.c:231: error: syntax error before 'PTR'


BFD library is not installed on the build machine. From gcl configure log:

I saw similar failure earlier today:

  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=30503449&forum_id=49144

on a debian system.

It seems I have no choice but to locate the fix that allowed
the system-installed GCL to find its own include header.

Many thanks for your patience and help.  I'll keep you updated.

I would very much prefer, if everyone includes the FULL path to a file 
and in which branch and what revision it actually is. How should I know 
that all these files are identical???

Anyway, you don't describe the problem you have, so I cannot help you. 
The only thing I can do is, how I can translate it.

cd Silver/branches/build-improvements/src/doc
svn update
#At revision 125.
cp axiom.sty.pamphlet DeveloperNotes.pamphlet ~/scratch
cd ~/scratch
notangle -Raxiom.sty axiom.sty.pamphlet > axiom.sty
noweave -n -delay DeveloperNotes.pamphlet > DN.tex
latex DN.tex

So what exactly is your problem???

Hello,

I have just realised that the file src/doc/axiom.sty.pamphlet 
(build-improvements) contains noweb.sty in full. A quick look at it lets 
me guess that only a few lines at the end of the pamphlet is actually 
making the difference to noweb.sty. The other things are probably taken 
to be some (fixed) version (not documented which one) of noweb.sty.nw.

Since we are going to make noweb a dependence also axiom.sty.pamphlet 
should remove the noweb related code and has it replaced by

\usepackage{noweb}

Otherwise, we might run into trouble with newer versions of noweb and 
incompatible changes to noweb.sty.

Ralf

The exact version of axiom--main--1--patch-50 is noweb-2.10a.tgz
This is the version in the zips directory.

There are axiom-specific latex tags. This is likely to increase
rather than decrease. This should be expected as we depend more
on latex as our tool. For instance, I have an as-yet-unpublished 
tag set that removes the use of

  <<randomchunck>>=

and replaces it with latex syntax

  \begin{chunk}{randomchunk}




The axiom.sty is intended to ensure that we can correctly and
consistently translate axiom pamphlet files. This is similar
to the policy of places like the AMS or Universities creating
their own style files.

Tim, when do you plan to make this change?  I realize it can be
(almost) automated but it would be nice to have that style going
forward, if that's our final target.  I've been working with auctex and
mmm-mode trying to convince auctex to quit using code chunks when it
does its fontifying of the latex part of the document.  Also, if we use
\begin{chunk} mmm-mode (which handles the dual-mode part of things)
will need to be taught how to recognize the new environment.  (I know
you don't need or use these, but for us mortals they are kind of nice
;-).  If that change is coming soon I should probably focus on the
\begin{chunk} syntax (which is probably somewhat simpler to deal with
anyway).

Also, one idea I want to mention now while there is still time to
consider it - would it be difficult to have an optional tag for a chunk
name identifying what language the code chunk is written in?  I ask
because for a number of applications (emacs mode mapping, syntax
highlighting in LaTeX using a package whose name escapes me at the
moment) it would be nice to know what language the chunk is.  Normally
a file is foo.lisp.pamphlet which works if all of the code chunks in
that file are lisp, but I know some pamphlets aren't like this.   Would
it be possible to specify a language (something like
\begin{chunk}{randomchunk}{boot} in a file.lisp.pamphlet file, for
example) so it is unambiguous and simple to determine how to deal with
it?

I have to say I tend to agree with this one.  We can examine new
features as they are introduced and see what the impact would be in
including them with Axiom, but I think a layer if insulation between
Axiom and those changes is probably a good thing.


Cheers,

The change will probably come about once I figure out all the
details of 'environments', which is fairly hairy. TeX is not the
easiest language to learn. I wouldn't worry about the change.

ummm, I'm unsure of how to handle optional tags in environments
but I'll keep it on the design list.

Before you don't show a .sty file, I hope that syntax change will not
happen. ;-)

Exactly. If Tim changes the syntax without giving us the nice tools we
have NOW, that would be a step back.

Well, if you considered LaTeX that is probably totally easy. Build on
the fancyvrb package and you have what you want in a couple of minutes.
There is also the "listings" LaTeX package which should be considered.

Well, if Cliff wants several languages in one file, then an optional
argument is a good idea. Again, an optional argument to an environment
is easy in LaTeX. However, I am not so sure why I would want several
languages in one file. Cliff, do you intend to mix your Aldor files with
LISP code? Brrrrhhh.

Maybe you have also realised that noweb offers a way to make clickable 
code out of the code chunks. See the ALLPROSE documentation. I am 
heavily using it. It seems that nobody has considered that feature of 
noweb for use in Axiom pamphlets.

So BEFORE you make the change to a new syntax, think twice about what 
you will be missing afterwards. If it is then impossible to link produce 
a link from one identifier in a code chunk to its definition, then I am 
strongly AGAINST that change. And note you would have to program all 
that in LaTeX (or depend on the listings package or something the like 
and add a few LaTeX lines). I don't think that this can happen in just a 
few days if you want all the features that noweb has NOW.

The other thing is that there seems to be too much manpower for Axiom 
that people think about that syntax change. I guess writing in noweb and 
having a little script later that translates the <<...>> syntax into a 
LaTeX-like syntax automatically, is probably an easy thing. But we 
should focus on more urgent matters. Noweb syntax isn't too hard to learn.

Do whatever you like. It is open source after all. But I am really not 
convinced that a syntax change should happen now.

Ralf

I'm talking of the file src/doc/DeveloperNotes.pamphlet.

To date Tim uses ${DOCUMENT} to latex the files; but he does ignore
any errors that might come out of the latexing process -- which gives
everybpdy the sensation that every is fine.

I've modified that file (on build-improvements) to take into account
the exit status of latex and the makefiles do now take it into
account.  The consequences is that it exposes few cases where the
typesetting process is not OK.  The above mentioned file is one of
them.  In particular is contains in various places characters '$', '#'
un-escaped, enclosed in [[ ]].  It also contains things like

   [[./lib/htrefs]]\\
   [[./lib/htsearch]]\\
   [[./lib/hthits]]


which confuses latex in many places.  etc.

My question was whether anybody actually tried to typeset that file
successfully.

The issue is what do you do when people already have noweb installed.

Since we don't use noweb.sty anywhere why is this an issue?

I haven't sent you the commands for nothing. Run them and you'll see 
that everything IS fine. DeveloperNotes.pamphlet is a noweb file, so you 
have to noweave it before running latex on it.

The [[...]] syntax is from noweb. A # there should be no problem. Take 
the follwoing file

%%%BEGIN aaa.pamphlet
This is a hash [[#]] and a dollar [[$]] sign.
%%%END aaa.pamphlet

Then say
noweave aaa.pamphlet > aaa.tex
latex aaa.tex

You should not get an error.

By the way, I rather think that latexing files should not be done by 
"document" but rather by some well designed Makefile logic. There is 
already something like that in ALLPROSE. Note that you don't know the 
number of times how often you need to run latex, but running latex 3 
times is often too much and sometimes you even have to run latex more 
than that. (There can even be cases where the output doesn't stabilise.)

Because, if Norman Ramsey decides to make a change in his program, he 
will probably adjust noweb.sty accordingly. If we still run an old copy 
(which is stored inside axiom.sty (so we are using noweb.sty)) then we 
are in trouble.

| Since we don't use noweb.sty anywhere why is this an issue?

The claim was that:

 #  The other things are probably taken to be some (fixed) version (not
 #  documented which one) of noweb.sty.nw.


Now, if you base axiom.sty on some "fixed" version -- noweb-2.10a.tgz --
and the build does not use the noweb version from Axiom and the
suggestion was to say (see Ralf's message)

   \usepackage{noweb}

my question is then why is it excepted that all of that works at all?

I am sure you had an error, but you don't let people know exactly what 
the error message is. So I stop thinking about it.

And by the way. Recently, I was reporting a successful build of Axiom. 
 From that time there was still a DeveloperNotes.dvi existing. Are you 
saying that is wrong in some places?

If you want I'll sent it to you so that you could check.

The document command is similar in spirit to tar.
Tar handles additional features like gzip compression.

The document command is intended to collect the various ways
you might want to handle a pamphlet file (weave, tangle, 
drag-and-drop, pdf, etc). 

Document is to pamphlets as tar is to tar files.

In general the user will not have a makefile for any given
document file and will need a command to extract the file
in the necessary form.

that is only remotely related to the problem I'm having, I think.

If you look at document on build-improvements, you'll see that it has
been augmented to allow finer grains. So your comparison is even more
accurate on build-improvements than on trunk :-).
[ I suspect that implements earlier discussions we have had and the
  improvements reflect what I needed. ]

Based on input from Ralf, I start suspecting mic-macs with the

That was the one I was thinking of.  If we can have a "default"
language for a file based on the *.langtype.pamphlet motif and then
toggle the language of the chunk for special cases (hence the optional
parameter to specify the language) we could use listings to give us
some really excellent pamphlet typesetting.

I would prefer not to.  But the early indications are that all of
interp is headed for bookvol5, which is currently a single file. 
Perhaps that will change, or the interp code will be all lisp?  If it
is unavoidable to have mixed code languages in one file, I do want to
make sure we can tell the listings package and mmm-mode what's going
on!

Also, if different files are eventually used in volumes, there will
probably be multiple languages in that situation.  We were looking at a
package a while back that might be able to actually do that - I didn't
get around to experimenting with it.

I took a stab at setting up allprose and didn't quite make it - I will
try again.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the \begin{chunk}{chunkname}
syntax was intended to have the chunkname be mandatory.  Couldn't the
logic then remain the same and just go for {chunkname} as the target
instead of <<chunkname>>?  Perhaps even the chunk-within-chunk
insertion syntax of using the <<chunkname>> could be the same? e.g.

\begin{chunk}{Chunk1}
some code
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{Chunk2}
some more code
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{MasterChunk}
<<Chunk1>>
<<Chunk2>>
\end{chunk}

No, it isn't.  But getting AucTeX to quit using $ inside code chunks
during it's fontification is not so easy, or maybe I'm just not doing
it right.  Does allprose fix this?

Tim said not to worry, so I won't ;-).  I just wanted to make sure we
didn't need to start working on mmm-mode now.

yes, some of my colleagues use it.  Over the year, I've come to prefer
the package fancyvrb because it is very flexible and it gives me all I
want.

I really find the idea of singling out keywords very curious and
anti-abstraction.  All the examples in

  http://www.research.att.com/~bs/popl06.pdf

are typset with fancyvrb.

I was referring to the "documentation". That exists as html.

You should definitely read chapter 9 "How to setup all features of 
ALLPROSE". And if you run into trouble just drop me a mail. I don't 
claim that the setup is fool proof. I'd like to have autoconf for 
ALLPROSE, too, but I'll wait until Gaby has setup and documented the 
stuff for Axiom, maybe then it is easier for me to add the autoconf stuff.

Oh, you should probably have written

\begin{chunk}{MasterChunk}
\use{Chunk1}
\use{Chunk2}
\end{chunk}

;-)

But you know that noweb can do stuff like

<<cat: CatA>>=
CatA: Category == ...
...
@ %def CatA

<<cat: DomainA>>=

No, ALLPROSE does not add emacs support. That's something else. I also 
have this strange problem and add the moment for the places where the 
colours get wrong I add "%$" on a new line right after the closing @ of 
a chunk.

I do appreciate the sentiment in Kai's remark, which he indicates
we should take as humour. But I am worried that some people who are
potential contributors to this discussion might well perceive it
as fact. If so, I think that is very unfortunate. Axiom is a very
small project in terms of the number of active and vocal developers
so it is easy to give the wrong impression. My opinions about Axiom
development differ from other people on this list on a number of
points and I don't feel shy about saying so. Is that setting an
example or reinforcing the feeling that there is no more room for
other opinions? :(

Perhaps we need to do more to make sure that people feel like there
is room here for differing opinions and that we would really like to
hear them.

While I would welcome anyone interesting in working on Axiom at the
level of the Lisp code, I seriously doubt whether compatibility of
Axiom with other open source Lisp libraries would make Axiom more
"friendly" to such developers. Or did you have some specific
libraries in mind that would have immediate application and mass
appeal?

Thanks Kai :-). Yes, I am glad that only one Axiom developer seems
to be actively wasting his time on the idea of eliminating higher
level languages from Axiom... ;)

About ANSI lisp and licensing Aldor as open source, I agree that
indeed these are pressing problems - even "mission critical"
problems! If we don't solve these soon, I have little hope for the
immediate future of Axiom let alone the next 30 years.

Having already implemented several user interfaces for Axiom, e.g.
TeXmacs, MathAction, AxiomUI and (soon) Sage, we do know very well the
kind of information and communications protocols that would make these
systems easier to program and more robust.

I am afraid that I have to agree with Kai. We should not be tempted
to try to use Axiom as a fulcrum on which to lever renewed interest
in Lisp. To do so would almost certainly crush Axiom. In contrast to
the situation when most of Axiom was designed and implemented, there
are many other programming languages available today that are capable
of supporting Axiom and this is especially true when it comes to GUI
development.

No! This is open source and it's the 21st century. We should *never*
be thinking about re-writing other people's code. We need to be able
to collaborate with other projects and make direct use of other
people's work whenever we can. This is a philosophy that is deeply
embedded in the Sage project and I think it is largely responsible
for why it has become a major new computer algebra project is less
than two years - about the same amount of time we have been discussing
this GUI issue... The sooner we understand this philosophy the more
likely it is that we can save Axiom from the ghetto.

The critical thing here is to design an asynchronous communications
protocol that allows the GUI process and the calculation engine to
work independently but in a co-operative manner.

I think we should pay close attention to the Twisted library currently
implemented in Python

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

Twisted will very likely be used in the next version of Sage to improve
the Sage NoteBook GUI interface. It is especially suitable for use with
AJAX methods for web browser interface design.

If there is any similar kind of "event-driven networking framework"
that has already been implemented in multi-threaded lisp then that
might be of immediate interest. But even without such a library, as
Kai says it would possible to implement this as, say a Python process
running Twisted that communicates with the Axiom core is a more
primitive way.

Yes indeed. There has already been some interest expressed on the
part of the Sage Notebook developers to extend the Notebook interface
to work with Axiom. This is quite different than providing a direct
Sage interface to Axiom itself, for example the way Sage interfaces
with Maxima now.

This mismatch exists and is (largely) solved right now in Sage
between GAP, Singular and Maxima.

In principle this sounds like a really hard problem and it has even
given rise to a really big attempt at a general solution in the form
of OpenMath, but Sage ignores almost all of this and is a successful
demonstration that in practice this is not such a big problem. Sage
provides it's own dynamic strongly-typed object-oriented language
(actually just Python!) that serves as an interlingua between otherwise
quite different systems. It is interesting to note that this is the
same method that Martin Rubey used in Axiom to encapsulate Polymake.

??? GAP already provides some tools for proving algorithms written
in GAP. Obviously the thing to do is to make use of these tools
where they exist.

I disagree that it is not important. To me, helping to provide a high
quality Axiom interface for Sage should be one of our highest priority
tasks at this time. The sooner we do this, the less we risk being
further marginalized by the success of this new open source project.
And because in contrast to those systems which already have an interface
with Sage, Axiom was built with an object-oriented philosophy very
similar to (in fact I would say, much more advanced than) Sage, I think
Axiom has a lot to offer the Sage project.

I think Martin's point is very important: that input and output
in Axiom are "designed in" to Axiom domains at a very fundamental
level. Therefore it is probably not practical nor desirable to try
to achieve a situation where the "Axiom main branch contain no
GUI-related code other than the implementation of the Axiom<->GUI
protocol".

But if by GUI-related you mean hyperdoc and Axiom graphics as opposed
to AXIOMsys itself, then I agree that these should not be considered
part of the core. Only AXIOMsys needs to be instrumented for an
external API.

As a bare minimum we need the kind of interface designed by James
Amundson for Maxima and used by A. G. Grozin in the TeXmacs interface
for Maxima. See http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima
But I think that for Axiom we can do even better than that and
accommodate many other kinds of information such as Axiom types,
graphics data, and Axiom database (daase) queries.

Bill Page.

I doubt that is a problem.  If there is reluctance, it is probably
because many of the contributors here are skilled and senior
professionals at this game, and the newer arrivals don't feel qualified
to contradict them.  I myself should probably be less vocal in these
discussions until I have code to back up my ideas, as I am by no means
an expert.

It never hurts to assert that.

I doubt there are any that would have "mass appeal".  The most
immediately useful might be CFFI (for interfacing with numerical
libraries, for example.) There are a variety of somewhat longer term
possibilities - Femlisp, for example.  http://www.femlisp.org/

I agree about the immediate future.  The long term is another matter,
but the amount of work required to get there will be higher without a
free Aldor.

I expect it is a bit of a moot point if we are not going to have a
default GUI in the main Axiom tree.  Probably in the end there will be
many interfaces in many toolkits.  I take it there would be no
objection to the development of a Lisp based GUI as long as no move was
made to make it "the default"?

I agree we should make use of available resources in the short term,
which does mean reusing work.  The really long term (maybe even beyond
the 30 year horizon) is I suppose not especially useful to think about
at this time.

I think it depends on what one wants to do.  In full formality of
proving a result, as I understand it, every last step has to hold up -
I just don't see how potential differences in environment assumptions
can be avoided as a major problem in such a case.  For most uses I
agree that it is not likely to come up, but I am still extremely
dubious that such an approach can scale cleanly to all of mathematics. 
One of Axiom's strengths and main attractions is that it may actually
have the potential to scale enormously and cleanly.

That's just it - I would eventually like to see Axiom reach the point
that any mathematics included in it is backed by proving the algorithms
formally, and be able to generate proofs for its results.  While some
projects might have some of this done, many (to my understanding) don't
go to that extreme.  That then means incorporating the ideas behind the
existing code into Axiom, and providing whatever is needed in the way
of proofs, research paper citations, theory discussions, what have you.

Anyway, I'm not yet qualified to be arguing for such a position,
really.  Kai and I are trying to put our heads together and come up
with something a little more useful to do than argue about GUI issues,
so I at least will turn this discussion back to the real experts :-).

Cheers,
CY

Dear all!

next week I'm going to present my guessing package at MathInfo 06. It works
quite well meanwhile :-)

Hower, there is one thing I don't really want to program - in fact, I won't -
although it would be really really useful. Maybe somebody else can do it. I
offer a price, ok?

The challenge is as follows:

I need an operation evalADE that takes a functional equation of the form

f(x) = g(f(x), D(f(x),x), D(f(x),x,2),...),

where g is any "nice" expression, some initial values, and an integer n.

The result of the operation should be the n-th coefficient of the taylor
expansion of f, if it exists.

Even more important, suppose that the functional equation is of the form

p(f(x), D(f(x),x), D(f(x),x,2), ...)

where p is a polynomial. These f are called differentially algebraic.

The algorithm does not need to be especially fast, but it would be nice to be a
able to compute the first fifty to hundred coefficients in a reasonable time.

Note that Axiom provides an operation seriesSolve, which provides a partial
solution. However, it is very buggy and gives up even for certain algebraic
equations.

Price is negotiable.

Martin

What exactly do you mean? That you have to write something
On page 17 of
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/listings-1.3.pdf#search=%22listings%20latex%22

\lstset{emph={square},      emphstyle=\color{red},
         emph={[2]root,base},emphstyle={[2]\color{blue}}}
\begin{lstlisting}
for i:=maxint to 0 do
begin
     j:=square(root(i));
end;
\end{lstlisting}

??? In particular the \lstset{..} command?

If yes, then I agree.

But assume you could tangle Aldor code and retain some information of 
the .pamphlet file inside the .as file. The Aldor compiler should have 
an option to spit out a file (something like an .aux file) that would 
magically add such statements (in fact hyperlinks) to the appropriate 
chunks. We then would write \begin{chunk}{NAME of the chunk} ... 
\end{chunk} instead of \begin{lstlisting} ... \end{lstlisting}.
If you don't run the Aldor compiler you still could latex, but you just 
don't get the hyperlinks.

That is what I would consider ideal. Now, I think, whether the input 
syntax is <<...>> or \begin{chunk}{...} does not really matter that 
much. The aldor compiler would be needed to figure out where the 
definition of a particular keyword is and that is where the trouble begins.

I am not completely against a syntax change, but it should not be just a 
simple change. It should add some real value. Otherwise it is just 
wasted time.

I guess that could have been done with ordinary latex features like 
\begin{verbatim} ... \end{verbatim}. The only places that I see that are 
impossible is the slanted text referring to "ConceptName".
But note that you are writing for a paper journal and you only give 
program snippets. I would like links from a usage of an identifier to 
its definition. Just suppose you have all the pamphlets online as html.

Howdy,

I've just attempted to svn checkout the axiom.silver branch. I had two
errors: (1) the checkout appeared to fail, (2) the configure file
emits an error. My machine is:

Mac mini (macmini1,1)
Intel Core Duo
1.66 GHz
ROM: MM11.004B.B00

Mac OS X 10.4.7

The svn error is this:

svn: Can't open file

Actually, this is correct. I do not yet know how to build
Axiom on a MAC. There has been a recent suggestion that we
use Xcode and I'm pursuing that path.

Tim --

  Jacob is a student at TAMU taking my class on symbolic computations.
He is interested in provisos -- I suspect at some point he may get
into touch with you.
He is trying to build Axiom for his class work.

>From what I understand, Bill has been able to build the
build-improvements branch with some patches from Camm (which I believe
I already put in build-improvements).  I have a fix for the debian
failure.  Once that is in, I would like to make a tarball of
build-improvements available from axiom-developer.org or from SF
(whichever is OK with you).  This is to remove the "random" checkout
errors.

oh, probably. :-)
but my advice would be to ignore me. i'll get over it.
my opinion matters about as much as anyone elses.
try not to give it such 'voice of god' authority.
you have the ability and permission to do anything you want
which is why you're a project admin.

I have built the build-improvements branch on the axiom-developer
server (in fact that is what is running on MathAction right now).
But I think the build process still has some problems. For example,
I am not able to build (even if I specific '--without-noweb') if
noweb is not previously installed and in the PATH. Also, the
option to build from a previously installed gcl does not work
so the option '--without-gcl' is still necessary. Since building
from pre-installed gcl is possible on Debian using the Debian
source distribution for Axiom, there must still be something
missing from the 'gcl-system' option in the build-improvements
branch.

There is also an additional patch which I am still discussing
with Camm to solve the "Can't rename' problem. The patch that
I am using now might not be the ultimate solution of gcl-2.6.8.

Until a few days ago, I was also working on the SourceForge
compile farm - specifically on the OS X build. But SourceForge
currently has a network configuration problem which prevents me
from accessing their servers:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=3Ddetail&atid=3D200001&aid=3D155345=

>=20

I also continue to see some svn checkout errors. In some cases
on some platforms this seems to be a recoverable error by just
repeating the 'svn co' command until the checkout completes. On
others, the local svn archive gets unrecoverably locked. :(

I wonder if this might be another network configuration problem
at SourceForge?

Maybe we should setup a mirror of the SourceForge SVN repository
on the axiom-developer.org server? Then at least we would have an
alternate site in case there is a network problem.

Regards,
Bill Page.

  I wonder if anybody have thought of putting Axiom in the Google
repositories.

  http://code.google.com/hosting/

  I already have Doyen in there http://code.google.com/p/doyenlivecd/

  They did start with SVN since day one, and probably do not have the
problems
   that SourceForge had moving from CVS.

This sounds good to me.	I don't see any problem having the code
spread around except for keeping the various locations in synch.
Do you know if we can configure the Google repository to automatically
mirror the SourceForge repository?

And you are volunteering to set this up at Google?  Yes? Oh Good!
:-)

Bill Page.

| I have built the build-improvements branch on the axiom-developer
| server (in fact that is what is running on MathAction right now).
| But I think the build process still has some problems. For example,
| I am not able to build (even if I specific '--without-noweb') if
| noweb is not previously installed and in the PATH.

I think I fixed that, as per my conversation with Waldek

  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00225.html
  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00226.html

| Also, the
| option to build from a previously installed gcl does not work
| so the option '--without-gcl' is still necessary. Since building
| from pre-installed gcl is possible on Debian using the Debian
| source distribution for Axiom, there must still be something
| missing from the 'gcl-system' option in the build-improvements
| branch.

As per discussion with Waldek, I'm able to reproduce the failure on
the SF compile farm host debian system.  For long time I've blamed GCL
for not finding its own internal files.  I had had several "fixes" -- none
of which I liked, because I felt they were ugly.  I finally nailed
down the real source (I think): It is caused by this line in
src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet for building interpsys

 @ echo '#+:akcl (setq si::*system-directory* "${SPAD}/bin/")' >>  ${OUT}/makeint.lisp

That setting of *system-directory* fools GCL's logic for invoking GCC
to compile the intermediate C code.  I don't see any reason why Axiom
would want to set that variable if it is not going to copy whole
/usr/local/lib/gcl-x.y.z (or wherever that directory is) -- and I
don't see any reason why it should do so.  As I'm writing this mail, I
have a build going on.  Hopefully that would settle the issue.

Notice that fixing that bug also opens the door for reducing the
number of Axiom-specific patches we have to apply to our copy of GCL
sources.

Thanks for the update.  Let me know once you guys have decided on what
is the good way to fix that problem.

| Until a few days ago, I was also working on the SourceForge

|
| https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=200001&aid=1553456&gro

Yes.  I intended (last week-end) to post the list of hosts that I
can't connect to (the vast majority of them), and the list of hosts
lacking latex. The work on out-of-source build finally got me to a
point where I just needed to svn checkout from a "good host" and
seamlessly build on other machines (as user directories are
automounted everywhere).

Very likely.

I'm not a big fan of project sources scattered all over the place with
sync snafus, but I'm definitely for a good solution that removes the
network problem out of the way.  Hopefully, now that we have
out-of-source  build, people would no longer need to "rm -rf" the
wholse source.

  I know that Google will not let you register a project that is already in
SourceForge
  (same name). Hopefully it can do more than this. I will look into this,
especially
  because it has been a concern to  have different source out of sync.

  I think Google will email the registered administrator to allow have Axiom
listed
  in their repositories.

  I was afraid of that. :-)  (always afraid of the higher powers).

setting that breaks build of Axiom with system-installed GCL.
I've looked into how GCL uses si::*system-directory*.
I don't see how setting that variable as Axiom did can be ever correct.
Maybe the problem is somewhere else?
I don't have access to a sane *BSD to test, and I welcome any
help there.


src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet around line 611 reads:

twofact.spad.pamphlet (NORMRETR TWOFACT)                ;; <== HERE
unifact.spad.pamphlet (UNIFACT)

I looked into that file, but nothing "obvious".


The patch was tested on an 

* i686-pc-linux with GCL and noweb installed
* x86_64-suse-linux with noweb installed and WITHOUT GCL installed.

I've long errouneously blamed GCL.  Detailed investigation turned out
top be an Axiom doing.  Fixed thusly.

Tested on:

  * i686-pc-linux with GCL and noweb installed
  * x86_64-suse-linux without GCL and with noweb installed

Bill, if you can give it a try on mac, that would be very appreciated.

  Thanks Gaby

  Well the page repository is up now: http://code.google.com/p/axiom/

   Looking at http://code.google.com/hosting/faq.html and the web I do not
see a way yet
   implemented to import or keep in sync with SourceForge.

   I would like to know if I should proceed to put the source in there...if
yes then: should it
   be an exact copy of sourceforge?

   If anybody has gmail accounts please let me know to add them as
administrators ( I
   can send invitations to who ever needs one.)

   Regards,

   Alfredo Portes

  I am concerned with this too. It has happened to the source of Axiom in
  MathAction. I could try to keep it updated to the best of my abilities
(maybe
  a script???). Any suggestions are welcome.

Hmmm... doesn't svn have some way to pull patches from another
repository? :-( Maybe 'svk pull' and 'push' can help?

Hosting FAQ says:

How do I get a copy of my data?
    At this time, there aren't any import or export features. But
    look for them as the service matures.

I guess we have to wait. In the meantime perhaps we can work out
a semi-automatic way to apply the patches automatically sent to

  'axiom-commit@lists.sourceforge.net'

Are you subscribed to that list?

Yes and yes. At least this will allow us to test the checkout
problems and see if they are cured by the use of a different
host. Of course we may have to change things in the future.

This "gmail" stuff confuses me since I do have a "Google Account" but
apparently not a Gmail account. Anyway Google says:

 "If you don't have a gmail account you can ask someone you know who
  already has a Gmail account to email you an invitation"

So Alfredo, could you send me an invitation please? :) To:

  bill.page1@synthesis.anikast.ca

Bill.

Cool. Now I really feel sucked into the Google vortex... ;)

I added a few extra links to the project page.

Looks nice.

Good work!

I don't have access to a mac right now, but I can confirm that the
following commands build Axiom just fine on axiom-developer.org
with both noweb and gcl pre-installed:

$ svn co
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements \
         axiom.build-improvements

$ mkdir axiom-build

$ cd axiom-build

$ ../axiom.build-improvements/configure

Maybe we should set the option to eliminate the GCL banner?

I note that the GCLOPTS shown above do not correctly reflect the
fact that gcl was pre-built with different options.

Thanks for your work on this!

Dear Alfredo, Bill,

as you probably know, I'm going to present my guessing package next week - only
as a poster, unfortunately, but still.


I would like to be able to give away Live-CD's (Knoppix style) that contain
Axiom and my guessing package, so that anybody can put it into his laptop and
try it out easily.

How am I to proceed?

IMPORTANT NOTE: the guessing package on MathAction is completely out of date. I
need the most recent version on the CD. Should I send you my package with
compilation instructions so that you can put it on the CD, or should I do this
myself somehow?



I'm sorry I'm so late, I didn't manage before...

Thanks for your help,

Martin

  Sorry Martin, the latest version of the LiveCD uses Fedora, because it was
the
  final goal to use Redhat software.  I have not had time to try to put
MathAction
  on a Knoppix CD. I guess I should look into this. :(

  Have you used the latest LiveCD ??? Do you have any particular reason to
need
  the Knoppix one??? Let me know if there is any particular issue that you
would
  like me to address.

  The process of creating the LiveCD is very straight forward (using the
Fedora LiveCD).
  Following the instructions, it should not take more than 45 minutes to
have a complete
  CD from scratch by using virtualization or a clean system.

  If you send me the package, I would be more than glad to include it in the
CD. I could
  also customize it so it appears on the menus and add the paper or poster
that you
  are going to present. I can have this done by Wednesday night / Thursday
morning.

  Regards,

  Alfredo Portes

In the case of expansion around an ordinary point of f(x) satisfying a *lin=

differential equation, i.e.,

a0(x) f(x) + a1(x) D(f(x),x) + a2(x) D(f(x),x,2) + ... + a_k(x) D(f(x),x,k)=

There is a paper by Nedialkov and Pryce=20

http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/PAPERS/DAEs/taylcoeff_I/

that proposes an algorithm for the general problem. Maybe that's the one we

No, I don't mind what system it is based on, I didn't know anything else but
Knoppix so far. I did not see the latest LiveCD, my computing powers here are
rather limited - I have to ask the computer group for everything. In fact, I
cannot even burn CD's... (But they will do it for me, of course)

Well, I need the image downloadable on friday. Is it sufficient if I send you
the package with instructions tomorrow evening? (i.e., european time evening, I
have no idea what time zone you live in :-)

Thanks a lot for your help,

Martin

First of all, there was not proper response to my suggestion

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00138.html

of how to deal with the "binary" file problem that we have in the 
sourceforge repository. I think we should solve that BEFORE the data is 
moved to google code.

Where are the SVN experts???

Hmmm, but SVN has a way to run a script if someone says "svn commit". 
Couldn't that be used to send the patches from one server to the other?
I have however no idea whether google or sf allows to run such scripts 
at commit time. Anybody more familiar with that?

On the other hand it seems that SVK could be tricked to do the 
syncronization job. Gaby what are your experiences with that?
Isn't SVK creating a copy of the SVN repository locally (also as an SVN 
repository)?

And don't forget to update http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources
appropriately, once the "mirror" is working.

Best regards
Ralf

SVN checkin...

in a clean Axiom (no CVS, .arch-ids, .svn directories, etc) do:

cd ~/axiom/..
ls -lR axiom >foo
 (edit foo to change each line to read  svn add filename)
 (edit foo to set the binary information for binary files)
sh ./foo
cd axiom
svn commit -m"first commit"

this should work. it's the method i used to create the CVS
systems because if you've been on this this list long enough
you can remember the
   axiomgnu/new/axiom.... 
import debacle. one slip of the command and you'll live with the
mistake for a long time since these hosts don't like deleting
information.

it has the added benefit that you can set up the binary file info
before svn guesses wrong.

This is not about making Axiom attractive to random Lisp
developers. It's about making Axiom development easier by allowing the
use of existing libraries and tools. Also, by packaging certain
functionality into a library that is indepent of Axiom, we might get
people to work on that, if they have similar needs.

On common-lisp.net you can find lots of useful libraries for GUIs,
threads, file and directory operations, databases, XML parsing,
parsing in general, data compression, logging, text processing, type
setting, scientific computing and other things.

i set out to fix the silver version.
so far i tried 8 checkouts without success
and now i'm up to 20 updates, slowly grabbing pieces.
SVN on sourceforge seems broken somehow.

Why cannot we first agree on how to fix it. Just removing the SVN 
properties (svn:eol-style and svn:keywords) is probably NOT enough.

I have given a short procedure that should do the work without much trouble.

I just have no confirmation from anybody on the list that this would be 
the right way to go.

 From what I have seen the binary property is set correctly already.

I would even do the update of the Silver TRUNK, but if nobody is 
convinced that the procedure is correct I rather hesitate to make a mess 
out of the trunk.

Please let me know if you need any help or clarification here.  All my
patches are under the debian subdirectory, patch.all and patch.merge.

I looked at this discussion, and there does not appear to be a
consensus on probe-file and directory.  As far as GCL goes, we can do
anything that passes Paul's ansi tests, as we do at the moment.  So if
you have such a suggestion, we can implement same.

The easy way, which avoids the requirement of PDP-10 lisp
comaptability :-), is si::stat.  How about this:

If we can agree on the interface, and on the Windows and Mac
equivalents, I can get this into 2.6.8 before release.

If there are any problems with the Debian package setup, please let me
know.   Will do a new axiom release once I can get 2.6.8pre to build
on mips and m68k.

Take care,

I think it would be better to be selective and leave the
svn:eol-style property as set on the text files.

This looks like the right approach.

I don't think you can make it any worse. :-) This is a repository
anyway, so if it turns out not so good, then we just revert it.
Rember to check Tim's "patches-49-50" file to compare his original
lisk of changes. It looks to me like the only thing Tim missed
was to delete the svn:eol-style property from the binary files.

As far as I know there have been no patches directly to trunk
that are not also in arch axiom--main-1 branch. The only real
new work in Axiom Silver is going on in build.improvements.

The sooner we get trunk fixed up, the sooner we can plan on
merging build.improvements back into trunk and then into Gold.

Thanks for you offer to help with this.

Regards,
Bill Page.

It is possible that you are using a proxy that does not
understand the full WebDAV protocol as suggested in this email:
http://lists.ofbiz.org/pipermail/dev/2004-August/006333.html

------

We are behind a squid 2.3 http proxy which doesn't know about
WebDAV protocoll. It uses special requests which are been blocked
by squid. Solution1:
like you noted using https (squid simply forwards the ssl packets)

Solution 2:=20
extend the squid.conf file to support the webdav requests:
# add WebDAV methods
extension_methods SEARCH PROPFIND PROPPATCH MKCOL MOVE BMOVE DELETE=20
BDELETE REPORT

--------

It used to be the case that most proxies ignored encrypted packets
such as generated by https, but that may no longer be the case.

I think it would be worth checking if you are using a proxy
(sometimes this is hard to tell because the proxy can be
embedded in your corporate or ISP firewall) and if it can be
configured for the above WebDAV methods.

For me this problem is highly dependent on where I am located.
At home the problem is severe. At work the problem is intermittant.
On the axiom-developer.org server the problem does not occur at
all.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Here is another report:

I have successfully built the Axiom Silver build.improvements
branch on a Sun 280R (sparc, 64bit) Solaris 10 06/06 system with
a full GNU toolchain installed.

bash-2.05$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.1.1

bash-2.05$ ld --version
GNU ld version 2.17

bash-2.05$ make --version
GNU Make 3.80

bash-2.05$ awk --version
GNU Awk 3.1.5

etc.

I built and installed GCL separately from the Axiom build.
I really like this option. :-) I think it makes the whole
build easier.

bash-2.05$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/ \
             branches/build-improvements axiom.build-improvements

bash-2.05$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/ \
         branches/build-improvements axiom.build-improvements

bash-2.05$ tar xzvf axiom.build-improvements/zips/gcl-2.6.8pre.tgz

But it wasn't quite so easy... A patch is necessary to build GCL.

---------

Probably the GCL build should to be updated to properly detect at
least the two major toolchain configurations on Sun Solaris systems:
Sun native and GNU. Over time, these seem to be converging but there
are still significant differences.

Apparently GCL must be built in its own source directory. When I
tried to build GCL using lndir to ghost the source tree, GCL built
and ran but it would not properly perform a compiler::link function.
It returned an error message contain ~A format character where a
file name should have been.=20

bash-2.05$ cd gcl-2.6.8pre
bash-2.05$ ./configure --disable-emacsdir --disable-tkconfig \

bash-2.05$ nohup make&

bash-2.05$ tail -f nohup.out

bash-2.05$ su

bash-2.05# make install

------------

Some patches were also necessary to the Axiom sources.

bash-2.05$ cp axiom.build-improvements \
              axiom.build-improvements_orig

To work around problems with X11 include file paths in the first
part of the build, I set the following environment variable:

bash-2.05$ export CPATH=3D/usr/openwin/share/include

"CPATH specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with -I, but after any paths given with -I options
on the command line."

A better solution might be to include the 'AXIOM_X11_CFFLAGS'
variable in the CFLAGS option in those builds that reference
the X11 libraries and include files. Something like this:

Me too, baby. :)) And proxies are hardwired too. ((:

Whether you connect via a proxy or not can be quite transparent
to you - they hide everywhere these days: inside NAT routers,
in ISP firewalls, and NSA computers... A proxy is just a stateful
process that sits between you and the rest of the world, limiting
the type of transactions that can pass on a given port (and doing
whatever else they want to do with your transactions).

But you might be right that you are not behind such a proxy.

Anyway, the idea that proxies can cause problems with the WebDAV
protocol used by SVN seems to be quite common on the Web. But
(usually) this does not apply to encrypted transactions sent via
https. And we are already use https.

Bill Page.

Higuer powers :-) (Bill, Tim, Gaby, Ralf...),

Trying to commit the Silver source to the Google repository, I had the
problem
of going over the disk quota limit. (100 MB).

I email google and they asking me what size we need.

If you can advise me on what size would be good?

Regards,

Alfrdo Portes

20G should be probably be OK for the next few years -- if we don't
have a surge of interest :-).

Alfredo --

when you get a chance to commit, make sure that the source files don't
(except configure and friends) get the executable file bit set -- that
is unfortunately the same with Axiom gold and silver.

Thanks!

Alfredo,

On Tuesday, September 12, 2006 6:48 PM you asked:
=09
> Trying to commit the Silver source to the Google repository,

Currently the arch repository axiom--main--1 is 169,896 Kbytes
computed using 'du -K B'. I expect that svn trunk is about the
same size. (It is actually inflated because of old zip files and
other junk.)

There will be several Axiom Silver branchs, would guess many
100 Mbytes each... Gaby has been removing the cruft but svn is
more of a pig for storage than arch. The build.improvements
branch seems to occupy 267,772 Kbytes on axiom-developer.org.

Maybe we should run some kind of packing job?

So I would suggest that you ask for at least 1000 Mbytes -
more if they don't think you are crazy. :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hmm, now this means I can no longer mess the build-improvements branch
without having Bill after me :-) :-)

I'll set priority to integrate your suggestion and merge a good part
of build-improvements to silver (after extensive testing and all
that).  Which means I have tp get back to Ralf soon.

I have more work on the makefile simplification in the pipeline, and I
would like to have them in.  I would like to support parallel build of
Axiom, because it takes just too long to compile sequentially.  I
don't have that implemented yet.  But good part of the work is in
testing.

I'll work with Camm for the GCL bits.

Thanks!

Hi Camm,

  I fixed that part in Axiom.  It turns out to be a problem in Axiom's
build setup instead of GCL -- as I erroneously suspected earlier.

I would like to support parallel build but that will not happen for
gcl-2.6.8.

The file stat stuff is more urgent.

there is a chance that they will give the lower he ask -- so I will go

this is a low hanging fruit toward simplification of the makefiles.
None of the following variables are needed in Makefile.${SYS}.

yes, testing on as many as supported platforms is a prerequisite for
merge to silver.  At this point, I'm still working on an experimental
branch.   I would like to move as quickly as possible to the big
picture and fix the missing bits as I get access to more platforms.

I have no access to a Fedora Core 5, nor a *BSD platform.  IT is
essential for me to get Axiom build on MACs though.
Any help is much appreciated.

To build the build-improvements branch at the moment, you need to have
noweb installed in the build environment.  I took that as a working
assumption based on past discussions.  When it is time to merge to
trunk, I'll work on reducing that requirement. (It is not hard to
remove though).

>=20

Noweb's master distribution is here:

http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/nr/noweb/dist

You can use that if you want. The executables have to be in
the PATH. Or you can use the one in the zips directory.

If the default build '--without-noweb' had worked, the one
in the zips directory is the one that would have been built.
That is was not automatically built is a bug.

Regards,
Bill Page.

What's wrong with your installation of yum?

Or do you mean that noweb is not in the yum archive?

'apt-get install noweb' works fine on Debian.

You can use the one in the zips (just way --without-gcl) -- though I
also build with GCL-2.6.7

If you have GCL installed, configure will detect it and use it.

What? I previously had my private HOME directory versioned by CVS, at 
the beginning of the year I have moved to SVN for that. (I don't use the 
Berkeley DB format, but created via "svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs ...".

The CVS repository was about twice the size of my HOME, for SVN it is 
LESS THAN HOME!!! SVN zips the patches that are send to the repository.

I can understand the other goodies, but not the space considerations. 
SVK actually has the WHOLE original remote SVN repository stored locally 
as a "depot" under ~/.svk so that you can do things off-line. SVN just 
extracts a working copy (actually two since the files that you have 
checked out are in their original version additionally stored under the 
.svn directories.

I don't really know whether SVN or SVK needs more space.

> SVN becomes very hungry as the number of branches grows.

I don't really understand. Creating a branch is done via "svn copy". If 
you look at the size of the REPOSITORY, you'll see that it has grown 
less then 1000 Bytes. SVN is just storing that the new branch is copied 
from the some origin. The actual copying takes place at checkout time.

But anyway... 100MB at google seems a bit to less for Axiom. ;-)

Error: Secure connection truncated

 Some users encounter this error communicating with svn.sourceforge.net,
 particularly on long running commands like checkout. Here is a response from
 Sourceforge:

While we are not sure what the cause of the problem is, the following seems to
 resolve the 'Secure connection truncated' error message that some SVN users
 have encountered. In the [global] section of the ~/.subversion/servers file,
 add the following line: http-compression = no

Hmmm. Maybe your suggestion is good, but after I've sent my mail, I just 
tried

cd trunk
svn update

and succeeded.

So I tried again.

svn co -r1 https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk trunk
cd trunk
svn update

No problem with that.

Maybe the "svn checkout" causes the problem. "svn update", however, 
works fine.

Tim, could you try to check with the -r1 option and then an update?
If that works for you (actually, I don't remember that you have given an 
explicit failure message) then we should update

my guess is that yum is not in the fedora archives.
yum doesn't use debian so the only option is a hand install.

well, i'd hoped that i could make a definitive test.
i modifed .subversion/servers and set http-compression=no, 
did a complete checkout, and it worked.

i unset http-compression (back to yes, i guess) in .subersion/servers,
did a complete checkout, and it worked.

so at 5a.m. EST it appears to work and nothing was proven.

it could be that http-compression causes the cpu usage to spike
when running the checkout requests and they have a ulimit or other
clamp on the host process which kills it. 

i'll rerun the same test around noon and see what results i get.

Hello,

as you know, I have freshly checked out Gold (--patch-50) and Silver 
(trunk r133).

You know Silver is a mess with respect to the properties. I've just run

cd Axiom/Gold/axiom--main--1
find . -type f ! -regex '.*\.arch-ids.*' ! -regex '.*{arch}.*' -exec cmp 
{} ../../Silver/trunk/axiom/{} ';'

Of course, many of the .Z files differ.

But if you shorten the output a bit via

find . -type f ! -regex '.*\.arch-ids.*' ! -regex '.*{arch}.*' -exec cmp 
{} ../../Silver/trunk/axiom/{} ';'| perl -ne 'if (/.*\/(.*) differ:/) 
{print "$1\n"}' |sort|uniq

you'll find

tla-1.1.tar.gz

In particular the .patch files are interesting. In Gold they appear with 
a line ending of CR LF, in Silver it's just LF. I have the suspicion 
that tla does not take care of different system. SVN stores always the 
UNIX line endings inside the repository.

Maybe the 2.6.6 and below patches are not so important, because we are 
removing them anyway soon, but we should somehow agree on storing Unix 
line endings for source files inside the tla and svn repositories. 
Otherwise it is more difficult than just running cmp to check whether 
Gold and Silver trunk are in sync.

I'll try to get the binaries correct and leave the .patch files as they are.

BTW, Tim, why is there now also "tla-1.1.tar.gz" inside the axiom archive?

And libaxiom.al is there to avoid running the scripts from Peter 
Broadbery? But note that this thing gets out of date if ever somebody 
modifies some algebra files.

it's very curious why these have CRLF.
i'll fix that in gold in the next release.
we can fix it in silver now.

So, now I have run to check from Silver r133 to Gold (--patch-50).

Hmmm, it seems that Silver/trunk already contains a few more files than 
Gold.

Gaby, would you like to keep it that way? Or should we rather have

(tla) Gold to be = (svn) silver/trunk

??? Any patch would have to be applied to both repositories.

OK, then fix it in Gold, Silver is already OK.

But anyway, these files go away soon... ;-)

> BTW, Tim, why is there now also "tla-1.1.tar.gz" inside the axiom archive?

i'm trying to port axiom locally to 3 different systems,
Windows, MAC OSX, and FreeBSD.

none of them have tla and i need to build it.
it appears that i'm going to have to add patches (ala GCL)
in order to create versions that run everywhere.

eventually these patches will be pushed upstream and hopefully go away.

i know this is 'verboten' but these systems are not debian and
you can't just do an apt-get to install the code. but until the
patches go upstream the users of these 3 systems need the tools.

peter's script requires java, i believe.

it won't be an issue until aldor is released

Is there any particular interest in keeping CVSROOT?

If that it gone, we also don't need the axiom directory, but could move 
the files and dirs inside it one level up.

in general, silver will be ahead of gold so there will be differences.

i used the PATCH49-50 directory so i could journal my changes.
it isn't really necessary but i thought i'd share them so others
could see where i made mistakes.

the CHANGELOGs below the top level directory are probably unnecessary
but don't hurt anything. my working method has been to catalog every
change in the top level CHANGELOG.

CVSROOT is probably a legacy of the fact that the SVN archive
was created automatically from the CVS archive.

> in general, silver will be ahead of gold so there will be differences.

This is where I don't agree.

There will be several branches in silver that have patches that don't go 
to gold, but Silver/trunk (and only that directory) should be in sync 
with the Gold version you are working on.

So at each point in time Silver/trunk should contain exactly the same 
code as is in your local Gold-to-be archive. If you don't want that then 
make the Gold-to-be archive public so we could get the patches you apply 
to that archive and put it into Silver/trunk.

The standard is to do 
 ./configure
 make

but in noweb you need to change to a build directory and then do
 cd build
 ../configure
 make

trivial, but annoying, forcing you to read the docs and you know
how i hate documentation :-)

methinks you may be confused on this point.

when i say that silver will be 'ahead' of gold i'm saying exactly 
what you said. silver (assuming i'm ever able to maintain it) will be
gold-to-be, in sync with my latest set of mistakes. (all code changes
are mistakes until properly tested, then they become bugs :-) )

actually, i went back to gcl-2.6.6 and the original files were DOS
meaning they followed the DOS standard for line endings. this is
changed as of gcl-2.6.7.

Hello

are the .bitmap and .mask files in src/graph/include/bitmaps/ really 
text files? They look like that. How are they generated? And would it 
make sense to add a svn:eol-style=native property to them? (They 
actually already have it in the SVN repository.)

Same question for .xbm.

Gaby, what about all those text-files you have checked in? They don't 
seem to carry the svn:eol-style=native property. Should I change that, too?

Ralf

I think Tim is right.  My understanding of silver and gold is that
silver will have patches *before* gold considers them.

I used the unix-style, but if you believe native is less troublesome,
yes please go ahead.

No, no, I think we all agree now. The confusion appeared because it is 
not really clear, what is meant, if somebody speaks of gold or silver. 
So to make it clear now.

*Gold*: The latest release of axiom--main--1--patch-??
*Silver* = *Gold-to-be* =https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk

All the other branches like, for example, the build-improvements branch 
on sourceforge are experimental (a bronze thing, so to say).

I hope we all agree on that terminology.

Ralf

PS: Maybe it was just me who was confused. :-)

Tim,

What about the files
src/share/algebra/DEPENDENTS.DAASE/index.KAF
src/share/algebra/USERS.DAASE/index.KAF

They look like text files, but I guess it matters if they are checked 
out under Windows and get CR LF line endings?

Ralf

they are the axiom initial database files.
an index.KAF file is a binary random access file.
the first integer in the file is the byte offset of the hash table.
the hash table has a set of (key . index) pairs
the index is the byte offset in the file of the value for the key.

OK, a few more file types that I am unsure of...
Not that I cannot recognise text files... what worries me is whether 
Axiom still treats them correctly if they are checked out under Windows 
and compiled there natively. I faintly remember that Tim said something 
about some files that have numbers in them counting the bytes to access 
the data. If a checkout changes the line-endings the count is wrong.
So please tell me what filetypes should keep/get the

svn:eol-style=native

property (ie change to native line endings at checkout).

For some files I prefer to remove the "eol-style" property, because they 
are not really source files (like .ps and .eps files, for example).


.daase
.data

I am moving between Windows and Linux/Unix all the time.
The difference between line endings is seldom a problem
for text files but the way some systems bend over backwards
try to "help" you with this non-problem is what actually
causes the problems.

Why did the designers of SVN allow this? !! Tim, said earlier
that source archive systems should NEVER modify the source
they are asked to store and I strongly agree.

I think it is funny that these files have an ascii text string
(possibly varying in length) that represents the byte offset.
It is a strange mixture of paradigms but I guess it is ok.

Actually my understanding is that if we remove the svn:eol-style
properties from all files and set that as the default, then
SVN will just leave all the files alone.

I think we should remove it from all files and make that the
default.

Hi Bill,

somehow you are contradicting yourself.

In a previous mail

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00294.html

you suggested:

 >> I think it would be better to be selective and leave the
 >> svn:eol-style property as set on the text files.

I've already locally modified the eol-style and was just about to 
commit. The following files and extensions are left with the "native" 
eol-style set.

I believe it is OK if they are left as text files and change the 
line-endings.

In particular, I would like to see it for .pamphlet files. It gives a 
terrible mess if some windows user changes ONE line in a file, commits 
the thing and I run a diff to the previous version and see that ALL 
lines have changed.

The copyright files...
   .AXIOM
   .B
   .BULL
   .CC
   .CCL
   .EAY
   .FSF
   .NOWEB
   .RAND
   .SMC

Some other obvious text files.
I actually don't understand why in the repository is anything else than 
pamphlets. I can understand .fig, .jpg, .png or such files, but not 
.lisp, .tex, .sty, .text, .h. Maybe .booklet is special.

Any reason why there are such non-pamphlets?

   .H1 <-------- I am not sure about that one. Looks like a .h file.
   .booklet
   .h
   .lisp
   .pamphlet
   .patch
   .sty
   .tex
   .text

   CHANGELOG
   ChangeLog
   FAQ
   Makefile
   README

   axiom
   configure
   document

These files are probably not needed anymore...

these are include files. part of the rewrite was to put them into
the pamphlets but i never finished the task.

this is standard text input to the patch tool. probably could be
a pamphlet since patch will recognize its own input. try one and 
see if you can get patch to swallow a pamphlet containing a patch
and still extract the patch.

You are right. I have been thinking about this for a while
and I realized that I had become suckered into this whole
'svn:eol-style' thing, too. Part of the problem is that
svn is trying to be "all things to all people". If they
had just learned to say "no" life would be so much easier...

I have changed my mind. It is true that they probably "do no
harm" right now so they could be retained. But it is only
an accident of the conversion from CVS on SourceForge that
they are there at all. To save us having to re-visit this again,
and again, say when people do checkouts to MAC (\r line endings)
and Windows (\r\n endings), God forbid that anyone should ever
try to install Axiom under VMS on a VAX computer...

I think we should get rid of them now. All text files in the
Axiom source distribution should use unix-style line endings -
period. When porting to other platforms it is the responsibility
of the port as to how to deal with this. On Windows almost all
text processing software treat \n and \r\n identicall. There
is a patch to the BOOT and SPAD compilers on the Windows version
of Axiom to do exactly that.

Ok.

That is an elementary Windows developer error. Don't expect the
archive software to save them - revoke their archive access
privileges!  ;)

Having to make the distinction between 'text' and 'non-text'
files is annoying and unnecessary.

I agree.

I don't.

With the very rare exception of essential graphic artwork (eg. book
cover) I think all such files should be generated from source - by
running Axiom, noweb, LaTeX, dvipng, graphviz, etc.

Right.

'booklet' is an experimental type of source file like 'pamphlet'.

There may need to be a small number of files to simplify the
'bootstrap form pamphlet' process. And some (e.g. README) are
present to conform to open source packaging common practices.

These are CVS control files that should not be in the
SVN archive.

That is no reason to keep an old distribution of tla in the
Axiom archive.

On each new platform you should start with the newest tla
sources available and solve problems with that, if you feel
motivated. Otherwise work-a-round them via scp or whatever.

Contribute such patches to the arch developers. They do not
belong in the Axiom source distribution.

On most common systems in use today there alternatives at

They already have there own tools. You need to learn to use
them. Otherwise Axiom will continue to look like just another
weird foreign system to them.

I've given up. Aldor.org et al have passed every target date
that has ever been discussed and they barely seem to be able
to keep the Aldor website up to date. I no longer believe that
they really want to make Aldor open source. Rather than simply
"it takes time to get everyone to agree", it seems likely that
there are some non-vocal associates of aldor.org that do not
want Aldor to be released. Otherwise I cannot explain why we
are still in this situation. :(

Note: Both Mike Dewar and Steven Watt have stated publicly on
this list that they support making Aldor open source.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Actually noweb is more non-standard than that. 'noweb-2.11b'
from the master distribution does not contain any 'configure'
option at all. The entire source distribution is in the 'src'
subdirectory and you have to edit the 'Makefile' manually
before typing 'make all'. Or you can write a simple shell
script like the example 'nwmake'.

Bill Page.

I have updated to version 133 of build-improvements branch and 
retried build on the same Debian testing machine. Now build goes
further, but fails running Latex on clifford.spad.tex
The reason for failure is missing amssymb.sty file.
I am affraid that if we want clean build, then configure should check
for all latex packages used.

Ah, of course, pictures should be exceptions, but allowed if they ARE 
sources. If somebody gives me a an idea how to put .fig into a 
.pamphlet, I agree, that also that can go away, but I don't consider 
xfig such a bad program. Note that the .latex generated from .fig is NOT 
the source. Of course, you know that...

So what is the opinion of people on the list? Should we just say

svn propdel svn:eol-style -R

???

If svn:eol-style is removed, I would like at least a script that takes 
care of commits that contain \r\n line endings. Such commits should be 
rejected. Can that be done on sourceforge?

I still think it makes better sense to *not* run the LaTeX part
of the build by default. If somebody wants it, they should be
able to run something like:

  make documentation-all

later. Or even individually like this:

  make clifford.spad.dvi

That's a good one. Assume clifford.spad makes a reference to Integer. At 
least when the whole documentation is build I want to see that reference 
turned into a link to the definition of Integer. For that we still need 
some good convention of how pamphlets should look like. Hmm, maybe we 
are not at that stage ...

On the Axiom developer web site we host the Doyen project

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Doyen

and such a live CD has been developed:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/DoyenCD

"Doyen is a Science Platform. It features a Live CD that contains
free and open source science software and a Wiki user interface
that runs on a laptop."

Right now the DoyenCD contains only Axiom, Magnus and Maxima. We
have been discussing add Sage and it's friends.

A complete description of how the DoyenCD was built is provided
here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/DoyenDocs

What *I* would like is some kind of updated version of the
Hyperdoc browser - probably using standard browser/local
webserver technology - that would allow external references
from the documentation. So we have such references embedded
in various places and/or generated automatically by something
that can parse SPAD/Aldor source code. Then while reading some
documentation or even a paper, a user can click on a link and
be immediately at the right place in Axiom.

The contents of this new Axiom Browser should be automatically
generated from alll the Axiom source distribution pamphlets.

If Axiom is not available locally, then such links should
automatically link to a standard remote website with similar
information. This should be possible with a little javascript
magic.

Regards,
Bill Page.

In short, it's the linux kernel ported to run as a normal windows process.
Because of the SAGE notebook, which provides the UI and graphics for SAGE,
the colinux approach works well.  Without that, it would be painful to use
for anything involving graphics.

How much space is left.  For SAGE, we'd need about 300MB, probably,
since we would want to include GCC.

==== NOWEB =============================================================
========================================================================
========================================================================

It took me 5 tries to install noweb properly from sources.

I managed to tar -zxf the noweb tgz file and it does not create a directory
so I ended up with a lot of random files at the top level.

I didn't have gawk installed

I managed to mis-edit the makefile and added crud to my system directories

The make all install failed to terminate, looping infintely deeper.

The 5th try worked.

| Ya, that is odd. What is 'gtar'? The output looks suspicious.

system make and the generation of Makefile files.
I'm curious of how he got that huge difference of timestamp.

Gaby, I don't understand. If you have a documentation of Axiom and click 
on a like then you should get somewhere or the link should not show at 
all. I would prefer a local documentation ie, the link goes to some 
local html, but if that cannot be found the link should either directly 
  link to some resources on the net or at least link to some footnote 
that tells you the appropriate URL.

Scary.

Does subversion come with the install?

The timestamps on the files in the Axiom distribution seem
to be corrupted. I have not seen this before. Could this
be related to your earlier SourceForge access problems?

Have you tried just to build GCL stand alone?

Bill Page.

Some systems have gtar, some don't.  Just like some have gawk instead
of awk (or nawk, or...).  The differences should not matter for our

I have never had this problem building noweb.

Perhaps this is another symptom of some kind of
misconfiguration of the gnu toolchain on your system?

Have you built any other packages from source successfully?

I don't know.

What I meant is I would hate to have Axiom starts competing with other

What I was saying is that I would like to have that as an option --
i.e. if the documentation is not locally available, I would prefer to
be given the opportunity to chose whether Axiom should contact the
world or just say "sorry, documentation missing".

It looks so.  I'd like to work on this further with you.

Unfortunately, I have a lecture in less than an hour and I have slides
to prepare for tomorrow.  It is almost unlikely that I have anything
done for Axiom tonight :-(

What I was saying, that I want a more or less thumb html page maybe with 
a few javascript items that are there to help showing what you want.
But there should be just links and the user has to CLICK to get some 
more documentation. Nothing tries to get other documentation 
automatically. I think you would favour that, right?

I guess, Bill meant nothing else with

Exactly. I did not realize that what I wrote was so ambiguous.
Thanks for the clarification.

Gaby,

Here is just a quick patch to make sure that all the
'stamp-*' directories are deleted in the case of
'make clean'.

Hi Bill,

I saw few emails regarding adding Sage to the Doyen CD.

Would you want me to add it now or wait until a possible
support for Axiom inside Sage.

I could have a CD only with Sage for now.

Also, should add your work on LatexWiki to support Sage
to the Doyen CD?

Regards,

Alfredo Portes

I don't think it is necessary to wait for that. I may be a
few more months away.

But both Axiom and Sage (about 300MB) are quite large. Do
you think they would both fit + DoyenWiki and Magnus on the
same CD?

Yes, I think having the LatexWiki support for Sage on the
CD would be very desirable. (That reminds me that I promised
to get those changes into the MathAction darcs repository...
I haven't done that yet.)

Bill Page.

  Ok.  If there is anything I can do to help please let me know.

  Yeah it is okay, keep it comming :-) . I created an image of Doyen
   with Sage:

   http://alfredo.axiom-developer.org/DoyenSage.iso

   I exhort to try it and let me know if anything is missing. I put a
   Sage icon on the Doyen menu. The Sage notebook should be
   functional also.

   To take for a spin using vmware:

    Just let me know to add it to the CD and make it an official
    release in MathAction.

    Thank you,

Man. You're good! :-)

I downloaded it, burned the CD and popped it into my desktop,
rebooted and there it was. Very easy. I think it boots more
quickly than Knoppix.

Did I miss it? I didn't see the Sage icon.

But I had no problem running Sage from a terminal window.

Yes it is. Works great. Maybe there should be a specific
icon for that too that just starts NoteBook and runs the
browser in one click.

I have a lot of trouble running VMware on this old office
desktop. But it runs fine on a much larger machine at home
that I use for my real work... :) I'll let you know later.=09

Expect the update to the repository in a couple of days.

BTW, I really like the new content in the DoyenWiki. We can
also add a few pages about Sage. There is an 'AboutSage' page
on MathAction that we can cut-up and paste.

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. We should get a copy of the DoyenCD into BitTorrent soon.
And into the Axiom Tutorial book.

Tim, since you "own" the Axiom book on Lulu can you look into how
to do this? Of course I can arrange to publish it as a separate
item and I will also add it to the CafePress Axiom Gear - but
you know, I am disappointed by how little "gear" actually gets
ordered :(  I like my Axiom mug and my Axiom baseball cap! :)

I think that this is so far past our current skill level and
the available resources that there is virtually no chance that
this will ever be anything but a paper exercise.

If we have to live without Aldor then I think we would be much
better off looking at possibilities such as how to make Ocaml or
Haskell work with Axiom. Ocaml at least is heavily used in proof
systems and has a syntax and object model not too different
from SPAD and Aldor.

Bill Page.

Fortunately you can do all that with the following command line.
So just make an icon that does the following:

     sage -notebook sage_notebook 8000 localhost True

It'll make a directory sage_notebook in whatever directory that
command is run in, start the SAGE server, and launch the default
web browser with the notebook loaded.

You're doing so much for SAGE -- I really need to get the SAGE<-->Axiom
interface going soon.

  Bill,

Man. You're good! :-)


  I have learned more from you and Tim than in many of my CS classes.
  I wish I could contribute more regarding source code...some day.

Did I miss it? I didn't see the Sage icon.


  Applications -> Doyen -> Sage

Expect the update to the repository in a couple of days.


  Ok.

BTW, I really like the new content in the DoyenWiki.


  Ah, that was the easy part, just needed to copy your work :-).

Hi Bill,

Nice that you have opened up that site.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SilverBinaries

However, I think we should stick to some naming convention otherwise 
people (not me anymore) get confused.

What we have is like Debian.

Gold = stable
Silver = unstable
Bronze = testing

You promote the build-improvements branch which is clearly in the 
testing phase, so it should NOT be called Silver.

It seems that we are all quite lazy and confuse the sourceforge 
repository with Silver. That should not be done.

Only

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk SilverAxiom

Should be called "Silver". It is actually correctly stated at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources

but maybe, I should add "Bronze" to the testing heading?

Anybody against that distiction? If no then SilverBinaries should be 
called BronzeBinaries and it should give the complete URL to download 
the sources, or there should be a link to the 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources
page.

Ralf

Hi Alfredo,

I strongly believe that you should put your name onto

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxActiveAxiomDevelopers

Or send me some data and I'll do it.

Your work on Doyen and Sage is important for Axiom. Thanks.

Ralf

Hello,

I give up.

I've removed the svn:keywords from all files and svn:eol-style from 
selected files. Of course that involved nearly ALL files of Silver, but 
after the commit went on for more than 45 min (!!! That looks like whole 
files have been transmitted, although I have only changed properties.), 
it tells me the following.

[snip]
Sending        axiom/zips/noweb.src.Makefile.patch
Sending        axiom/zips/tla-1.1.tar.gz
Sending        axiom/zips/vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet.patch
Transmitting file data .svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: MERGE request failed on '/svnroot/axiom/trunk/axiom'
svn: MERGE of '/svnroot/axiom/trunk/axiom': 500 Internal Server Error 
(https://svn.sourceforge.net)

 From what I see, all files were sent to sourceforge, but as you can 
read from the attached mail, the commit was not completed because the 
log is too big. Nothing tells me that, if the list moderator (whoever 
this is) accepts the post that then also the commit succeeds.

I am simply frustrated by this. Why should I split a commit only because 
of limitations of the tools?

Ralf

It clearly says "commit failed". But hey, try "svn update" in the trunk 
and you'll see that the commit succeeded.

If that is not strange...

I'll continue to copy the --patch-50 files to silver and try to correct 
the corrupted binaries.

many of my students were scared by the name "unstable" and did not
want to touch it.  I don't think they are unique in that respect.

I know that for GCC, for example, we call mainline, "experimental" -- not
"unstable".  Personally, I would prefer to reserve the "negative"
sounding "unstable" to branches like "build-improvements" -- which
really can be very unstable :-)

Excellent work. You're really adding value to the project.
Your name is now on the credits list and will show
up as of patch-51, the next release.

To see it start axiom and type
  )credits


Btw, if anyone notices a name missing please send me a note.
I've made a great effort to collect the names of people who
have helped make Axiom what it is.

Hi,

I have just done...

cd $Gold
find . -type f ! -regex '.*\.arch-ids.*' ! -regex '.*{arch}.*' \
      ! -regex '.*\.patch' ! -exec cmp {} $Silver/trunk/axiom/{} ';' \
      -exec cp {} $Silver/trunk/axiom/{} ';'
cd $Silver/trunk
svn commit

Committed revision 137.

As you see, I have left out the .patch files, since they appeared to be 
without the strange \r\n endings in the SVN repository.

Could someone check whether a windows checkout of Gold and Silver 
agrees. (Maybe it does not, since I haven't deleted all the 
svn:eol-style properties.) The binaries should be correct, however, 
under Windows and Linux.

Still to do...

Remove the binary property from the .pamphlet files. I did not do it 
since the binary bit is set for those files in my Gold checkout and I 
wanted SF/trunk to be in sync with Gold (up to this patches-49-50 
directory).

Any suggestions what to do here? Binary bits should be removed in 
Gold-to-be and Silver at the same time.

Maybe ... remove the svn:eol-style property from ALL files? BTW, what is 
tla doing with respect to text files?
And can sourceforge prevent people from committing textfiles that 
contain \r\n?

Ralf

On a different note, both to Bill and Jose,

It is important that we document everything we do in a way that
others can easily reproduce our work. Jose, I know you've heard
this song many times so I'll just sing the first verse.

Bill, I think it is important that we keep the doyen build
documentation up to date with all of the latest changes, specifically
how to add the wiki and the sage information. The pdf at
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/DoyenDocs.pdf
is, in some sense, more valuable than the CD itself because it
makes it possible for people to reproduce the work.

Can the two of you work on bringing the docs up to speed
with the Doyen CD distribution?

Are the how-to build docs on the Doyen CD?

Should I understand that?

Anyway, only the message is confusing. I sometimes tend not to believe 
what the error message is telling me. So I continued and succeeded.
Silver is now more or less in sync with patch-50. Corrupted binaries 
corrected.

I just wanted to follow the naming conventions of a big project like 
Debian. I quite believe that people who use Debian unstable all well 
aware that things could break. Anyway "unstable" does not have such a 
bad conotation for Debian. Am I wrong?

If we call Silver = experimental that is not very different from 
"testing". If you can come up with anthing better, you're welcome.

A suggestion could even be... drop "stable", "unstable", "testing" and 
just call the branches Gold, Silver, Bronze with a definition of what 
they are and the understanding that there is just ONE Gold and ONE 
Silver but many Bronze branches.

Unfortunately the Tutorial book cannot be changed without releasing
a whole new version.

The choice was to release the book with or without an ISBN.
This choice has implications.

An ISBN book can only have minor typo-style edits.
An ISBN book can be ordered by universities, book stores, etc.
An ISBN book can be picked up by B&N, Amazon, etc.
An ISBN costs money to register ($140)

A non-ISBN book can be changed at any time
A non-ISBN book cannot be purchase-ordered (eliminates most univs)
A non-ISBN book cannot be picked up by B&N, Amazon, etc.
A non-ISBN book is free

So I decided that the cost, which allowed much wider distribution,
was worth the restriction that it could not be changed without
producing a whole new version. Perhaps we can consider doing that
over the christmas holidays (when I get a larger block of time to
work on axiom)

Of course, we have no restriction on the version in the Axiom
source tree. 

Since you're advocating the change, you're volunteering, right? :-) :-)
(Heck, if you want you can even put YOUR name on the cover instead
of mine)

 Tim,

Can the two of you work on bringing the docs up to speed

  The latest work to add Sage is not in the docs yet. However,
  the current docs should allow anybody to reproduce the
  latest CD. Of course the docs can always be improved.
  I will revise the documentation.

Are the how-to build docs on the Doyen CD?


 Yes they are.  Not that visible now...quick fix.

Yes, I know debian uses that word.  And it also has the reputation for
"being for the though guys" -- whether that is justified or not.

But, with people I've talked to (not just here, but before I even
consider going to the US) "unstable" does not come with good
prejudice.  We have to think about it.  Like I said, I much prefer
"experimental" to "unstable".  I would prefer to reserve "unstable"
for much more experimental work than silver.

I don't dispute that -- just like people using "experimental" knows
things might break.  They have very different "implied connotations".

As I said, Debian is known -- rightly or wrongly -- to be for the
"though guys".  I don't want Axiom to be for the tough guys.

It definitely is.  I really would like to not call the
build-improvements branch "testing".  
I do believe that "unstable" for silver is not doing it justice.

That is one way of doing it.  As long as we reserve "unstable" for far
worse situations.

what I'm saying is that I see axiom-commits as telling me what are the
diffs between two successive revisions.  If the diffs sent to the
mailing list (not the real thing committed) are truncated, that is not
very helpful.

That is great!

I suppose so.  I was wondering if perhaps academic interest in such a
project might be generated - there are a number of teams around the
world working on related tasks.

Yes, Ocaml would make the possible heavy use of COQ a very interesting
possibility.  My biggest reservation is that the Ocaml compiler is
licensed under the Q public license with some exceptions, but I guess
that's a lot better than not having it available at all.

Haskell seems to have ghc, which looks to be licensed pretty much like
Axiom itself, but the juicy COQ incentive isn't there.  There's
something called Yarrow but it doesn't seem to be as "big time" as coq.

Anybody have experience with these languages?

Cheers,
CY

Dear all,

I believe that we should *not* embark on designing yet another language. I
played enough with Aldor meanwhile to really appreciate the language - with
it's deficiencies.

Those of you inclined on working on the language:

PLEASE get started understanding the interpreter and possibly extend it to at
least understand dependent types, and/or make types first class objects.

Axiom would benefit a lot - no matter whether Aldor becomes free or not. This
is the one thing we need in any case!

If you prefer to rewrite the interpreter in a different language, go ahead. But
please don't design yet another one!

Martin

I tend to agree with Martin.  We should focus on either SPAD (make it
better) or Aldor (hopeless).

Gaby, you should have replaced 'better' by 'Aldor' (language). ;-)

I work remotely. Once a week we have conference calls where we all
dial into a certain phone number and enter a pass code. 

It seems like this might be a reasonable thing to do with Axiom
because a lot can be resolved quickly over the phone.

Would this be a reasonable thing for Axiom?
Does anyone know of a place that provides this service?
Any idea of the costs involved?

As far as I understand Skype offers conference calls. That would be
free and Skype is available on Windows, Linux and Macs. Installation
(on a Mac at least) is trivial.

See www.skype.com.

If you'd like to try it out before committing to it, feel free to call me
(magicmuffinman).

I believe that in conference calls the host should be the one with the
biggest pipe, btw, since all communication goes over his machine.

[Skype for conference calls]

Another interesting feature is that people can participate with
regular phones as well (you need to on the order of 30 Euro/year,
though).

Skype also supports text messages. Tim, if you don't have a microphone
and still want to try, go ahead.

Dear Tim, *

I'm having problems adding algebra.

I have a package FiniteAbelianMonoidRingFunctions2, short FAMR2, and another
one, FractionFreeFastGaussianFractions, short FFFGF, which depends on the
former.

I modified the Makefile.pamphlet in src/algebra as follows:

USERLAYER=\
  ${OUT}/FAMR2.o   \
  ${OUT}/FFFGF.o   \
@ 


I also modified exposed.lisp.pamphlet appropriately. However, make NOISE= keeps
complaining:

  Semantic Errors:
      [1] generalInterpolation:  FiniteAbelianMonoidRingFunctions2 is not a known type

(generalInterpolation is an operation defined in FFFGF.)

I also tried to add FAMR2.o into the previous layer, i.e. layer 23, but that
didn't change things either.

If I remove FFFGF, the build completes and FAMR2 is visible... 

What did I do wrong?

Martin

Dear Bill,

could you please put the three attached pamphlets on mathaction.

fffg.spad.pamphlet => FractionFreeFastGaussianElimination

rec.spad.pamphlet => RecurrenceRelationOperator

mantepse.spad.pamphlet => Guess

(mantepse depends on the other two)

I got an error message about noweave not found, and including it via spad
doesn't seem to like the dollar signs...

(sorry for not being particularly useful anymore, I didn't sleep last night...)

Thanks for everything,

Martin

Hi Bill,

While editing: http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/DoyenDocs , I got this error:

Some or all of this page may not have rendered properly, because of the
following error:

/bin/sh: line 1: /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/lib/noweave: No such file or

Any idea?

Thank you,

Alfredo

I think you are right. SourceForge seems to be having ongoing
network problems. I still can not access the compile farm.

I don't know how using Savannah on Google is going to work out.

Maybe we should just put up our own subversion server on
axiom-developer.org. How hard can it be? At least then we will
know who to blame. :)

This is configurable. I have changed the limit to 500 KB. If
necessary we can make it larger.

Maybe we can configure this too?

Sorry to say, Martin, but even though you tried to document the API of 
the package constructors, your code is much in the spirit of the old 
Axiom files. :-(

Your code may be excellent, but it is clearly written for a machine and 
not for humans. So I cannot read it. You probably know that.

Take for example mantepse.spad.pamphlet:

\begin{abstract}
   The packages defined in this file enable {\Axiom} to guess formulas
   for sequences of, for example, rational numbers or rational functions,
   given the first few terms.  It extends and complements Christian
   Krattenthaler's
   program \Rate\ and the relevant parts of Bruno Salvy and Paul
   Zimmermann's \GFUN.
\end{abstract}

That is actually ALL there is to describe the algorithms you use inside 
your code. :-( Even worse. The macros \Rate and \GFUN are not references 
to the literature or URLs.

If Axiom were a Journal and your code were a contribution to that 
journal. I am sure you yourself would reject that.

Sorry for such harsh criticism, but I simply think if new things are to 
be accepted to Axiom they should come with a certain standard. We 
already have enough legacy code to deal with.

I would change my mind if your contributions makes (at least) two more 
contributors to Axiom Algebra and and you promise to document your code 
in an LP style till the end of the year.

Maybe you should have a nap... ;-)

Good luck with the presentation of your Guess package.

Ralf

Yes, sorry. I broke this while updating MathAction to a newer
version of Axiom recently. MathAction still expects to find
noweave in the Axiom binary distribution but that is no longer
true for the version of Axiom that we are using on MathAction.
I need to adjust these paths to use the installed version of
noweave et al.

I've just done a temporary fix and it should be working again
now.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Tim Daly and I have used Skype ... but we never seemm to be in

How's today, Thu 4:00 PM EDT (Kingston: UTC/GMT -5 hours + 1 Daylight)?

Timing is complicated!

Or any hour after that except dinner time (7:00 PM :)

I have a work conference call at 3:30 (it is currently 3pm here).
It should last about 1 hour. I'll try to initiate a call to both

Tim, Bill, Gaby, Ralf:

I need some advice:

This is the response from Google to my request for more space:

***********************************************************************************

You've certainly given us pause for discussion!  500MB or 1GB is a
*lot* of space, especially for what's supposed to be just source code.
We've been scratching our heads, wondering why your project needs so
much space.

Your project certainly looks mature and has a healthy community around
it, and we'd like to see it hosted at Google Code.  However, it also
looks like there's a lot of extra 'junk' in the repository... for
example, the zips/ directory contains dozens of releases(?) of the
same package?  (And even random odd Arch packages, like 'tla'?)

We'd like people to *not* use Subversion as a package-distribution
system, but as a source distribution system.  (We're working on
creating a dedicated 'downloads' feature right now, though!)  At the
moment, we'd be more comfortable giving you another 100MB of disk
quota... perhaps you could clean up your repository's history?  Trim
it down to just necessary source code, and move the release .zips
somewhere else for a while?

Tell them, we're actively working on reducing zips (the can have a
look at the build-improvements branch).  Furthermore, what
it contains is really necessary for building Axiom for many, common,
target configuration.  And, we cannot move the zips somewhere else.

1G is good for the moment.

Perhaps they think we are not serious?

They certainly will not object to the current 12G of GCC -- Google
invests lot of resources into GCC.

Participants: Bill Page, Kai Kaminski, Tim Daly
Start time: 4pm EST
End time: 5pm EST
Purpose: discuss how feasible conference calling is and whether skype can work

1) Skype conferencing works. 

   One of the key issues that arises is that you need to have 
   headphones because the microphone picks up the speaker output
   of your computer which causes echos.

   Another key issue (unresolved) is how to pass control of a
   conversation from one person to another. Perhaps we need to
   use Robert's Rules of Order or some such. Suggestions are welcome.

2) Kai dialed in from a MAC. He volunteered to look at the MAC port.
   Tim volunteered to 'partner' with this effort (see later discussion)

3) SVN is an ongoing problem. Bill volunteered to try to set up an
   SVN server on axiom-developer. Tim is partnering with that effort.
   Bill can do the setup and I can struggle with the checkin process.

4) One way of getting around the sourceforge SVN problem would be to
   create nightly tarballs. Savannah has that ability but it is unclear
   whether sourceforge does. Tim volunteered to look into it.

5) There was some discussion of setting up Xcode on the MAC.
   Apparently some people use a mouse, which Tim doesn't.
   Things were learned.

6) Bill make reference to the HP TestDrive machine set. This allows
   us to try building Axiom on a range of servers. See

   http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/HPTestDrive

7) Bill pointed Tim to the patches made for the SVN improvements
   branch to enable building Axiom on solaris. Tim will look into
   possibly merging this into the Gold/Silver branch.

8) There was a discussion of the possibility of losing work due
   to abandoned or partially completed branches. For instance if
   someone does a partial port of Axiom to a MAC How do we make
   sure that the work is not lost?

   Bill suggested two possible improvements. One is that each 
   branch is 'owned' by someone who is the person responsible for
   making changes and applying patches. 

   The second idea is a 'buddy system' where a second person 
   volunteers to 'partner' on an effort. That way you have to 
   report your progress to someone other than yourself. 

9) An important point is that skype will allow us to contact each
   other thru voice in a less formal way. However it is important,
   especially with conference calls, that the information about the
   discussion and the decisions gets recorded and reported to the
   mailing list where it can be journaled. 

   The current suggestion is that the 'host' (there can only be one
   host on skype) which is the person who creates the conference
   is responsible for taking notes and reporting results.

10) There was a discussion of which version (Gold, Silver, or
    Build-improvements) to choose when trying to port to a system.

    Tim's take on it was that the question revolves around the
    issue of whether the system is known to build on the target.
    If it is known to build then the only issue is whether the
    new Makefiles in Build-improvement works. If it is not known
    to build then Gold should be used so we can isolate the 
    Makefile bugs from the source code bugs.

11) There was a discussion of the next skype conference. The 
    proposal was that it should occur near 1pm EST so that most
    people can attend. It was also proposed that there be 
    regularly scheduled conferences. Tim suggested 1pm on 
    Wednesday and/or 1pm on Saturday.

12) The next conference is scheduled for 1pm on 
       Monday Sept 18 at 1pm

    Send your skype ID to Tim Daly so he can conference you in.

Throw away the tla tarball, and I agree that the build-improvements
branch is probably the minimum source code distribution.

They said +100MB that makes 200MB total, right?

If our primary motivation right now is to diagnose/solve the svn
checkout problem, then maybe just uploading the build-improvements
branch to Google Code would be sufficient for now.

I doubt that Google would host GCC using this mechanism so the
comparisonn is rather moot. The problem is, I suppose that Axiom
is not big enough to warrant direct Google investment but (almost?)
too big for the Google Code project.

Hmmm, I must admit that they are right. We have lots of junk inside our 
repository. However, we cannot change the situation just by deleting the 
zips. And zips is only half of the story.

I have removed the .svn files from my Silver and run

cd Silver
du -k .|sort -n
[snip]
6248    ./src/interp
7496    ./src/hyper/viewports
8104    ./src/hyper/pages
9660    ./src/algebra
15844   ./src/share/algebra
15940   ./src/share
17664   ./src/doc/ps
18792   ./src/hyper
24532   ./src/doc
56544   ./zips
81052   ./src
138296  .

Since svn zips the files, the actual repository should fit into 100MB.

But look at that file: src/input/mapleok.input.pamphlet
-rw-------   1 hemmecke hemmecke 234633 2006-09-13 10:03 
mapleok.input.pamphlet

Who is going to read that???

Has someone looked at the pictures in src/doc/ps ?
To me more than half of them look generated by Axiom, the rest is 
screenshots of HyperDoc. Both have terribly low resolution.

Is it possible that you or Tim or Bill can write to Ben Collins-Sussman :
sussman@google.com ? He is the person who wrote the last email to
me. You probably can explain in more detail than me why such a size
is necessary.

> 1G is good for the moment.

I think 200MB is the current size.

> Perhaps they think we are not serious?

In my first email I sent them links to  MathAction and the
SourceForge page, so the could see the community around
Axiom. The source is not in their repositories, so I assume
they did checkout it from SourceForge.

Regards,

Alfredo

I always thought it is "silver". 

I thought build-improvements should die (or be closed) once I'm finished.

OK, I did not know that.  Before reading your mail, I contacted a
fellow GCC developer (a very long time GNU toolchain contributor) now
at Google to know a bit about this issue.

Yes, we have junk in many places.  This won't change overnight --
unless we have someone doing cleanup as fulltime job.  In many vision,
even if move zips out (which I can't at the moment), we will accreate
more than zips, in term of functionality.  The solution to this issue
must be somewhere else.


Bill, if you transform axiom-developer.org into the SVN server I fear
that it becomes heavily loaded -- let alone situations where several
peple hammer on the SVN server to get source out.  I have no other good
solution at the moment.

How much does a 100G drive cost these days?

More cruft.

As far as I can see PLF is defined in Makefile.pamphlet but never
used anywhere in the source.

I suggest we delete it before somebody tries to use it. We don't
need more flags and special cases in the source if we can avoid
it.

Bill Page.

The C code uses this variable. look at src/lib/openpty.c.pamphlet.
It is used as a -D variable on the C command line.

What version of the source? I can't find it in either Axiom Gold
(axiom--main--1--patch-49) nor in the build-improvements branch
anywhere. Maybe I am blind.

Can you give me a line number?

src/lib/openpty.c line 22.

the compiler line reads:

   gcc -D${PLF} 

which expands to mark the platform like 

   gcc -DLINUXplatform.

Let's agree that it should be at least a part-time job. :)

But I fear that this situation is due to a difference in philosophy.
Tim Daly (and perhaps other earlier Axiom developers) seem to have
used the "everything and the kitchen sink" approach to the *archive*.
Whereas for other people the emphasis is on "source code control".
In that case everything else belongs elsewhere.

Could you describe this "vision" a little? What else do you
envisage adding to the Axiom source distribution?

I think this is a good example of something that belongs elsewhere
if we agree that the purpose of this archive is source code control.
I think keeping these sorts of documents on the Axiom Wiki (or the
Axiom Portal if it is personal research), makes better sense than
mixing it into the source. I understand Tim's purpose in associating
it with the "input" files since these are the closest thing that
Axiom has to actual test files.

Yes, some are quite terrible and contribute to the rather rough
appearance, for example of the Axiom Tutorial book. We should
be able to do better.

As I said earlier, I don't think things that can be generated
from Axiom belong in the archive. The instructions for generating
them - yes, but not the output.

We already have both tla and darcs archives on axiom-developer.org
These do not seem to lead to any significant load on the server.
Do you really expect that SVN is that much worse??

Peanuts at the supermarket, or on your desktop. But if you ask
Google how much does it cost, they would have to add the
proportional amortized cost of the data center and the system
operations and maintenance staff, etc... I think it becomes
non-trivial. :)

Tim,

Damn. So I guess it's too late. This stuff is everywhere. ;)

So the answer to Gaby's original question then is that for Solaris
one would expect this variable should be something like:

  PLF=SUNplatform

or SUN4OS5platform or ... something like that.

But at least in the case of the build that I was doing on Solaris 10
with the GNU toolchain installed, it looks more like a LINUXplatform.
I did not patch this variable in my build. (I have no idea whether my
compile would have worked if it had been set to SUNplatform.)

Anyway, I think all these flags are an unfortunate mess which should
really (eventually) be handled by the more general and more standard
autoconfig mechanisms. Right?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I think it MIGHT be possible for us to make SPAD support the key=20
feature or two we want from Aldor (type behavior, etc.) but even=20
if we do that, we are still faced with the problem that SPAD as=20
a language in Axiom does not have any really good foundation as=20
a documented language.   I guess my question to those of us=20
looking to improve SPAD is this - even if we can change it to=20
support the feature or two we need, how do we document the=20
language?  Do we have the resources to make a really formal=20
definition?  How do we tie those definitions to something that a=20
theorem prover could use?

Bill, do you have experience with Ocaml?  Apparently Ocaml and=20
Axiom are not completely unaware of each other as projects:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2005/07/cf19927bddbdfdbb6a06=
2bb9f56262e9.en.html

and apparently there has been some earlier discussion of=20
languages + mathematical "fitting":

http://listserv.acm.org/scripts/wa.exe?A2=3Dind0206c&L=3Doscas&P=3D481

Since my guess is some of the people on the list now were=20
involved in these earlier discussions, perhaps they can give us=20
an idea of what might be the pros and cons of using Ocaml or=20
Haskell to re-implement our spad code.

There are some earlier discussions of Ocaml on the list:
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-10/msg00204.html

Possibly relevant to this discussion:  there has been somewhere=20
some work with COQ and Axiom:

 http://www.emis.de/proceedings/MKM2001/hardin.ps

This is probably one of the documents we should look at first,=20
but I don't know how to obtain a copy:

1. G. Alexandre. D=E2=80=99Axioma Zermelo. Ph. D. Thesis, University of=20
Paris 6, LIP6, February 1998.

To the best of my searching abilities, it's not currently online. =20
I suppose a copy might be ordered from the University?

Personally, I am not so afraid of the idea of translating our=20
code, since I believe the effort required to understand and=20
document properly what is there is going to be almost the same=20
amount of effort as a re-write.  Hopefully the interp framework=20
is reasonably language independent  (after all we can plug in=20
Aldor - which is a separate implementation of a language, even=20
if similar to SPAD - already).  Since to make files fully=20
literate we need to not only understand the code but the origins=20
and definitions of the algorithms being implemented, we are=20
looking at a massive effort to spruce up the algebra code no=20
matter which way we go on the programming language side.  I=20
suspect (although I could be wrong) that understanding and=20
documenting properly the design considerations and mathematical=20
theory behind the SPAD code will be such a large effort that the=20
language considerations become secondary, except for the=20
question of what language has the most potential for benefiting=20
us at the 30 year horizon.

This issue was related to the fact that I recently sent you some
patches for building Axiom on Solaris 10/GNU from the build-
improvement sources. Tim wants to apply these changes to Axiom Gold
sooner rather than waiting for them to tricle through Silver to
Gold.

Tim is also very motivated to produce a successful build of Axiom
on MAC OS/X. I suggested that using the build-improvements branch
to do this port might be easier because of the build from system
GCL option (I also forgot to emphasise the build out-of-source).
But Tim prefers to work with the Gold distribution.

Tim is probably right that my building Solaris with the
build-improvements sources was probably a little pre-mature,
but I just like working with build-improvements so much more
than Gold, that I could not resist... :) And at least in this
little exercise I did not find anything that I would classify
as a Makefile bug.

Regards,
Bill Page.

mapleok IS an input file. I just took the time to document the
expected results so you could tell if you got the right answer.
It is partially on the way to automating regression testing.

Testing files are clearly part of the source control pile.
Especially since they are run as part of the source code build.

Those files are part of the original Axiom book (the Jenks book)
and clearly represent source for the book. One of the outstanding
problems I have to solve is how to place more than one image on
a page. That's the one blocking condition to reproducing the Jenks
book accurately.

Yeah, most of those conditionals are what make the C code hard to port.
C is the least portable language there is (I know because I had to 
figure out most of those conditionals). That's one major motivation
toward rewriting it in lisp.

It depends. The issue usually arises because the include file chain
changes with every platform. However, a linux-compatible include file
chain could use LINUXplatform. Try not to read too much into the name.

In theory, yes. In practice, no. I doubt anyone is going to figure
out the possible combinations automatically and then re-port the
code to the various platforms to ensure that it works.

No. The source is a Makefile that reproduces the graphs in exactly the
same way as they are now. BUT, for future versions of the Axiom Book,
the Makefile should set the option to produce higher resolution graphs.
So the actual source is MISSING or HIDDEN inside the Axiom book.

Without a clear problem description, nobody is able to help.

Do you really believe that somebody is going to read that file? Even if 
you documented it? I won't I am not a computed that checks whether the 
output that appears on my axiom session agrees byte by byte with what is 
in the .input file. I would have to count at least 100.000 bytes by 
inspection. I guess even if a computer can make errors. In such a stupid 
procedure I am far worse.

Right, but output should be checked automatically. And isn't it better 
to compare the actual Axiom data structures than the OutputForm result?

> Especially since they are run as part of the source code build.

Maybe you should look at Christian's AldorUnit. I think it's much better 
than just inventing a new test environment.

Those files have been carefully screenscraped and gimped to fit
the aspect ratio, size, etc. of the book. There is no obvious
way to auto-screenscrape hyperdoc pages.

Those images were made sometime in the early 90s.

Check the email archives where I was asking for help.

I recently bought a book (The Latex Graphics Companion)
that appears to contain the solution. Now all I have to
do is get educated.

Automated testing is a long leap to do in one step. Documenting 
the results of the tests is on part of the solution. 

As to the size of the file, why is everyone afraid of large files?
Rregression test files which will certainly get large.

(For my job I needed to regression test the Intel 01 opcode which
requires 23008 lines of assembler to test various combinations.
Regression test files get large.)

Advocacy is volunteering. 

I have a solution in mind but you're welcome to implement something.
We clearly need automated regression testing.

Hi,

...sorry for the delay.

Well, I downloaded the CD and tried it on my laptop and it didn't
work, but then I tried it on my desktop computer and it did! I think
its a great thing to have and to distribute, although I had serious
problems mounting my USB drive and my HDD (I wasn't able to do it at
all) by some issues with user priviliges. I don't know if its because
I'm a complete Lunix morron, or just because there is really and
issue. Well.

Anyway, its too bad that it doesn't work with my laptop! I guess it
has to do with the compatibility of the Linux live CD with my
laptop...its a relatively old Dell (Latitude CPi), which even has some
issues running the Knoppix live CD. I put the CD in and it doesn't
even start loading, it only shows the fist line of booting where it
says the author of the program who wrote the Live CD thing.

Anyway,

thanks for everything again!

Enrique

we just do it. :-)
Whether we convert to Aldor or some other language, we still need to
know the semantics of the SPAD language.  After all, the algebra files
have meanings (with bugs or not).

First, I would like to see the wiki stored as part of the SVN source
-- but I don't expect that to exceed the Axiom source code base.

Second, suppose we succeed in attracting people; I suspect that we
would have more and more branchs and more and more commits.  Frequent
commits make large depot.

no; the question I suspect is how many users do you currently estimate
for tla and darcs?  
My suspicion was that since silver is going to the the mainline, we
would have more and more people looking at it -- otherwise we don't
succeed :-)

Thanks for explaining, and thanks for your enthousiasm for the
build-improvemnts branch.  I, too, was (pleasantly) surprised by your
attempt and of course would like results available to people as soon
as possible.  But I fear that "pre-mature" testing with negative
results might make people turn away.  Or the contrary.

Anyway, thank you!

  I assume that your HDD has windows and a NTFS partition. I will look into
  these problems.

  You can always also do "sudo su" to become root and mount devices, but
   this should be working automatically...my bad :-( .

  Not you are not :-). Your feedback right now is one of the most important

  That puzzles me. Never seem it breaking at that point...one of the things
is
  that Fedora version works better with certain machines...Knoppix on
others.

   I would really appreciate if you can do something for me. Download this
iso:

   http://daly.axiom-developer.org/doyen/doyen04262005.iso

   Let me know if it boots up properly on your laptop. That is a version
based
   Knoppix. We could add Sage to it.

   Regards,

   Alfredo

It is used deep in the graph source code.  But, the way it is used is
waaaay pure disgusting hack (the author(s) should not feel offensed).
I think I most certainly had sent an email about it in the past -- if
not, then I'm sure I did compose the mail.

It is on my TODO list to remove it along with a better structuring.

| Yeah, most of those conditionals are what make the C code hard to port.

no harder than the lisp non-portable sutff all over the place in the
Axiom source code.  I don't think we have a perfect language match
here in terms of portability.  I've coded for longtime in C and C++; I
don't think this particular is stuff is handled the proper way.

Please, no.  Lisp does not look more portable than C to me.

yes, but the name is what people see.  It must be meaningful, are at

  I am the morron :-). In that image, I forgot to add the doyen user to the
  proper groups. If you log out, and login as root, password: doyen@org ,
you
  can see that it should detect your NTFS partition and the mounting should
  work fine. Again sorry for this.

   Also another favor, if you can give me the exact model of your laptop.
Probably
   I can look for one similar to try to reproduce the error.

   Regards,

   Alfredo Portes

Hi,

  to make it possible to test on more platforms, especially, those NOT
explicilty listed as being know to work, we need a uniform Makefile
file.  This patchlet moves the logic to decide platform specific
variables from the toplevel makefile to the configure file.
Next steps would consist in reducing the differences and actually
allow more platforms.

Tested on:
  * i686-pc-linux (GCL and noweb system-installed)
  * x86_64-suse-linux (noweb system-installed, GCL missing)

-- Gaby

2006-09-14  Gabriel Dos Reis  <gdr@cs.tamu.edu>

	* Makefile.pamphlet (do-all): Don't generate and call
	Makefile.${SYS} on the fly.  Remove special-cased Makefile
	stanzas. 
	(PLF, CCF, LDF, LISP, GCLOPTS, SRCDIRS): Define as
	Autoconf-substituted. 
	(ENV): Pass them on sub-makes.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerate.
	* configure.ac.pamphlet: Special-case PLF, CCF, LDF, LISP,
	GCLOPTS and SRCDIRS.
	* configure.ac: Regenerate.
	* configure: Likewise.

I'm not going to start another pro-Lisp discussion. But I'd like to
point out that Axiom's Lisp code is not representative of (modern)
Lisp code. Furthermore the conditionals aren't organized very well and
most of them are superfluos anyway, because they are for Lisps that
are long dead and forgotten.

That could be argued, I guess. Besides Lisp has quite a few other
advantages over C. :-)

Dear Bill,

unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work yet. How can I make MathAction compile a
pamphlet?

It seems that RECOP and the constructors in fffg.spad were compiled, but those
from mantepse weren't. Furthermore, I had to fix a typo in RECOP, but I didn't
manage to recompile it. Could you please try?

I put the things into the places were I feel they belong.

rec.spad is now linked from RecurrenceRelationOperator, fffg.spad from
FractionFreeFastGaussianElimination and mantepse.spad from
GuessingFormulasForSequences.

The pages Guess and SandBoxFFFG should be deleted.

Thanks a lot,

Martin

Probably.


I followed this discussion

with some interest.

Ok, I read the first dozen messages or so, but I'm not sure what
you're aiming at (IEEE 754 or FFI?). Could you give me a hint?

Yet another question:

I just noticed that the constructor RINTERP is not found by HyperDoc, only the
operation it exports. 

After using one of the operations, RationalInterpolation is found, but RINTERP
still isn't.

Tim, you added RINTERP some months ago into the user layer. I suspect that one
somehow needs to rebuild the databases to make it available.

How?

PLEASE HELP, I need it for the conference, for the CD's.

Martin

mantepse depends on fffg and rec

the constructors should be compiled in this order:

  ${OUT}/FAMR2.o    \
  ${OUT}/FFFG.o     \
  ${OUT}/FFFGF.o    \
  ${OUT}/NEWTON.o   \
  ${OUT}/RECOP.o    \
  ${OUT}/UFPS.o     \
  ${OUT}/UFPS1.o    \
  ${OUT}/GOPT.o     \
  ${OUT}/GOPT0.o    \
  ${OUT}/GUESS.o    \
  ${OUT}/GUESSINT.o \
  ${OUT}/GUESSF1.o  \
  ${OUT}/GUESSF.o   \
  ${OUT}/GUESSP.o

only 

  GUESSINT GUESSF GUESSP

should be exposed.

The dependencies are as follows:

no dependencies

  FAMR2  FFFG  NEWTON  RECOP  UFPS GOPT

  FFFGF depends on FAMR2 and FFFG

  UFPS1 depends on UFPS

  GOPT0 depends on GOPT

  GUESS depends on all of the above

  GUESSINT GUESSF1 GUESSF GUESSP depend on GUESS

Thanks in advance,

Martin

Dear Tim, Dear Alfredo!

root <daly@axiom-developer.org> writes:

great. A hint: I meanwhile found a (terrible) workaround. But this way I
probably won't get Alfredo to build Axiom :-(

Alfredo: it turned out that I can burn my CD's on Sunday afternoon European
time. So there is a little time left.

Tim:

I deleted all the algebra I want to add except FAMR2 and built axiom. That
worked fine.

Then I added FFFGF (which depends on FAMR2) and tried make. That
failed. However

make NOISE= DAASE=$AXIOM/../../int

succeeded!

However, this doesn't suffice to make all layers work. I have to complete the
build, then add the next layer, and so on.

I guess that

* the daase files in int should be updated after every layer.

* after the first update, i.e., after LAYER0BOOTSTRAP or so, DAASE should point
  to int.

I have no idea yet, why the constructors don't show up in HyperDoc.

Thanks a lot!

Martin

Ok, I guess it is about the fact that ANSI CL doesn't require
IEEE-754 floating point? Maybe I'm dense, but I don't get what you're
trying to say (seriously).

Dear Tim, Alfredo,

I just succeeded building as outlined below. Concerning the HyperDoc issue, all
constructors except those in the last layer are known now abbreviated and
spelled out. The ones in the last layer are known only spelled
out. Unfortunately, HyperDoc crashes on GUESSINT and GUESSP with bind stack
overflow, no idea why. 

Still, this Makefile problem really should be fixed.

Alfredo, is it possible that I just add the binary of axiom locally on my
computer somehow to the live CD?

Martin

hmmm, something bogus going on with the databases...

??? What do you mean by "compile"?

Perhaps you expected that the SPAD code embedded in the pamphlet
file would be "compiled" the same way that

  \begin{spad}
  ...
  \end{spad}

is compiled on a wiki page? Unfortunately that is not yet supported
inside pamphlet files. To do that we need some extension to the
LaTeX style files that run Axiom automatically and embed the result
into the LaTeX code. The main reason is that we need pamphlet files
to work both inside and outside of the Axiom Wiki environment.

This does work now with the \begin{sageblock} and \sage commands.
It uses some LaTeX code that was contributed by a Sage developer.
See

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSagePamphlet

What we have to do is extend this for Axiom.

To compile the code has to be in \begin{spad} ... \end{spad} in the
page source outside the pamphlet or on a non-pamphlet page.

To do that you can log in as a Zope user. If you like, I can do

The short story is that on the axiom-develop.org server you have to
reduce the MAXPAGE size to 128*256 or else upgrade to a newer version
of gcl-2.6.8pre.

I really would like to do this, but I cannot log in. I clicked on admin and
entered user kratt6 and my password, but it said "authentication failed"... Do
I misremember my username or my password?

I suppose that should read "off the roof" (as in suicide :).

I also do not see any evidence for the claimed portability of
Common Lisp. On the other hand I see applications written in "C"
on all platforms out numbering Lisp applications by many orders
of magnitude.

There of course even portability problems with Java - which was
intended specifically to solve portability problems.

What can we say?

"Life is complicated."

"Programming is a complex problem."

William,

I never used colinux.  The Doyen CD is based on Tim Daly's idea of a
collaborative science platform: http://daly.axiom-developer.org/doyen/ .

The goal of the project is to provide a common collaborative environment,
that
can be distributed in conferences, etc.

An example of this could be at Sage Days. It would be unlikely that
everybody in
the audience will have Sage on their machines, the same development tools,
experimental code, or  mathematical algorithms that you are demonstrating.
You could provide them with a Doyen disk created for that conference
(particular code, docs, etc.) and they will be able to reproduce exactly
what you are showing without having to modify anything on their machines.
Furthermore, with the help of a Local Wiki and a Online Wiki, the
participants can make suggestions and improvements and these will be stored
for future use.

So the two key points here are providing a science collaborative environment
and making code contributions more permanent. I should put emphasis on the
fact that Literal Programming is vital for these goals.

Probably Tim and Bill extend on the idea.

Regards,

Alfredo

Greetings!

Can we finalize this stat bit please?  I'm trying to get 2.6.8 out
....

In addition to knowing whether enough information is provided, I need
to know if it works on windows, macosx, and any other proprietary
system of interest.

Take care,

I think your proposal for the si::stat function is perfect.
I hope that it meets approval with other GCL users.

I will try your patch on Windows tonight and report results
tomorrow morning.

Martin,

Yes, there is a time-limit of 1 minute for Axiom on MathAction
to prevent any problems where a run-away process hangs the whole
system.

Can you think of why it might take more than a minute to compile
that page? If absolutely necessary I can temporarily relax this
restriction.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Kai,


Thanks for your quick reply. I can not send a mail to you, gmx.de does
not accept mails from my ISP, so I send it here. In fact I wanted to
know why you think that  _Axiom is somewhat 'unfriendly' to program_,
but in general and not only about interfacing with textual chatters. I
misunderstood what you mean, sorry.

I agree with all you said in your mail about the mess of using the
AXIOMsys input/output in a UI. I think this is the method used by Sage
(with the pexpect python module), when the user works directly with GAP
or GP objects for example, and I have to say that I'm not a big fan of
this method. They will encounter the problems/annoyances you mentioned
when they will create the interface to Axiom.  A last thing, I think
that, yes, the creation of a well defined communication protocol, as you
argued in previous mails, is the way to begin/go. About communicating, I
have seen that some socket related routines have been added to Axiom but
it seems that they are not used. It's probably an anticipatory work of
Tim.

Again thanks,

Greg

P.S: I finally forwarded your mail to this list with some hesitations.

Suppose you want to write a UI for Axiom (terminal app, Emacs mode,
GUI) that does more than just sending all user input to Axiom and
spitting out whatever Axiom prints. You encounter at least the
following problems/annoyances.

0) Right after startup Axiom displays a banner, which you have to
   ignore (in fact, you might even want to extract the version number,
   eg. for bug reports). Your UI starts AXIOMsys instead of axiom, so
   that error messages don't mess up the banner if X11 isn't running.

   Right after the banner there is either the prompt or random junk,
   depending on the content of ~/.axiom.input. What do you do with
   that junk?

1) How do you recognize the end of output?

   a) Wait until the next prompt/type signature/etc pops up.

      What if some user code prints something that resembles a
      prompt/type signature/etc? Also there are at least five
      different settings for the prompt. Other output options may or
      may not influence the display of the type signature.

   b) Wait until no more output comes.

      How do you know that nothing else will come down the pipe?


2) How do you extract meaningful data from the output?

   You'd probably be interested in things like

   - What is the IOindex of the last command? (The IOindex is the
     position in Axiom's history in that particular frame)

   - Did any errors occur? Which ones? Where?

   - Which type did the last result have?

   - What is the value of the last result?

   - What libraries were autoloaded because of the last command?

   - What other output did the last command produce?

   - What error/status messages did Axiom itself produce?

   There is no reliable way to do this, because whatever you think is
   a type signature, for example, could just be some output of the
   user that only looks like one.


3) How do you query Axiom for information?

   Suppose you want to get a list of the available domains. Sending
   ')wd' to Axiom does the trick. But again you have to parse some
   random, human-readable format that might not even contain all the
   information you're after.


4) How about integrating the HyperDoc and graphics subsystems in your
   GUI?

   First of all you'll have to open a number of AF_UNIX (why not
   AF_INET?)  sockets (good luck figuring out their names). Then you
   have to implement a number of binary protocols (yay!) that aren't
   documented anywhere.


5) How about Chinese?

   One would hope that eventually Axiom prints system messages in the
   language of its user. Now try to extract the information you need
   when all the messages are in Chinese.


There are ways around some of the problems described above. For
example, instead of sending user input directly to Axiom, you could
always send

  )lisp (foo ...)

where foo is a Lisp program that does what you want. Since you can
access everything from Lisp that would (probably) work. Needless to
say that it is messy, error-prone and relies on Axiom internals. Hence
you won't be able to change certain aspects of Axiom's implementation
without breaking foo, which breaks your UI.


The solution is quite simple. Instead of throwing textual chatter at
the UI, send structured data

(:result
  (:value some-structural-representation)
  (:type ("Fraction" "Integer"))
  (:presentation
    (:tex "\frac{5}{4}")
    (:ascii "5\\n-\\n4")
    (:mathml "???"))
  (:input-form "5/4")
  (:io-index 204)
  (:errors nil)
  (:warnings ((:low-memory "Running low on memory")))
  (:output nil)
  (:plot-data nil)

or, for the XML-inclined

<result>
  <value>5</value>
  ...
</result>

Axiom has all that information, emitting something like the above is
almost trivial. You now know when the output is complete (when a
well-formed answer has been received) and you can easily distinguish
all kinds of information.

Kai

Well, it takes several minutes on my computer. I don't really know why, but I
know that the compiler is a very sensitive creature. For example, moving the
operations ord1, ord2, deg1, deg2 towards the end of the constructor GUESS, on
my machine, the code will take nearly an hour to compile.

Similar findings are actually documented in some algebra files that are
currently shipped with axiom...

Thus, please either temporarily relax the time restriction (set it to 10 min,
for example) or compile the file by hand...

Thanks, 

Martin

Good; sorta.  At least it's not just me, I've been trying to access it
all week.  I seem to recall recently reading that there are other
compile farms, but I can't track down where I read it.  Maybe I
dreamed it.  Does anyone know if there's another compile farm similar
to sourceforge's?

That is ridiculously long! There has got to be a pretty serious
but in SPAD to take so long. :-(

This does not seem to happen during the usual build of Axiom.

It was easy for me to change it to 60 minutes. So you should
have plenty of time to compile now.

I'm the lead developer on Axiom. Axiom was originally developed over
a 23 year period at IBM Research (I was one of the original authors).
It was eventually sold to NAG. Axiom used to be sold commercially
as a competitor to Mathematica and Maple. In 2000 it was withdrawn
from the market and released as open source. See
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

I'm also the lead developer on Doyen. Doyen is a scientific
computing platform based on LiveCDs (similar to Knoppix). See
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/doyen
Doyen is intended as a vehicle to make scientific software
available at computational science conferences.


We attempt to work cooperatively to bring together the best
available talent and tools. I signed up for the developer
mailing list so I can understand what the current concerns
are for Scientific Linux and to connect with developers who
have an interest in working together.

http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki

We are already using 4 different source code control systems in
the Axiom project (CVS, ARCH, SVN, DARCS) and no one is entirely
happy with any one of them, so what's the harm in considering
yet another? :-)

Mercurial (Hg) has been getting some very good reviews. The Sage
developers are considering switching from darcs to Hg for reasons
of performance. They recommend the following introduction:

Gaby uses SVK to access our SVN archive. ;-)

Seriously, who is using CVS? Should we consider to drop keeping the CVS 
archive(s) in sync with GOLD? Should we drop CVS support? This synching 
process is needless work in my eyes... and we don't have so much resources.

Indeed.

How many active developers do we have?  How many VCS do we use?

I'm quite happy with SVN+SVK.  It is a pity SF's server is such a pain
in the ass to work with. :-(

it looks like we are more effective at replicating the base source
code in many VCS than actually moving it forward :-/
(that includes me)

Thank you, but it still fails. Could you please compile it by hand? It is
probably wiser to extract the code from the pamphlet stored at mathaction, I
don't really know what code is on mantepse2 now...

The trouble is, MathAction doesn't tell me what happened...

Thanks for your support,

Martin

I just realized that only the display doesn't work. The code was compiled
alright.

  Is there a reason why src/lib/hash.o is not put in the object

Question came up on IRC, and I'm curious.  Given the following:

                        AXIOM Computer Algebra System 
                       Version: Axiom (September 2006)

(5) -> a1

   a1 is declared as being in Quaternion Fraction Integer but has not 
      been given a value.

 5) -> 
   a1 is declared as being in Quaternion Fraction Integer but has not 
      been given a value.
(5) -> 

Why isn't this allowed?  I want a1->a4 to be variables without assigned
value, and I want to create a symbolic matric where all I know about
the entries is their type, in order to do general solving operations. 
How would I set this up correctly in Axiom?

Currently, you can't. Note that you promise axiom that a1 is a Quaternion
Fraction Integer. However, you don't hold your promise...

What you want is to make a1 a variable. Currently, there is no domain of
"Variables, which can take values only in Quaternion Fraction Integer".

In fact, it is (or should be) a FAQ. See MathAction.

The point of Axioms type system is that any identifier has a typed value. There
is no such thing as a identifier that does not have a value.

If you type 

5*a+a^2

into the interpreter, it responds with

Polynomial Integer.

When you say p:=5*a+3*a^2, the identifier p refers to this polynomial. The
internal representation is something like

[[5,a,1],[3,a,2]]

How would you represent a generic polynomial? You need a different domain for
that.

How do I not hold it?  I never told it anything about a1 except what
type it is - were did I contradict this?

Um.  That's surprising, at least to me.  (I suppose it wouldn't be if I
understood...)  Intuitively I would expect Variable to mean simply "an
unspecified specific instance of a Domain/Type/what have you" with ALL
domains being possible - just so long as you specify the type of the
variable, e.g.:

a1 : Variable(Matrix Quaternion Fraction Integer)

A specific example might be with working in dimensional types:  If I
define F as type Force, m as type Mass, and a as type Length/Time^2 I
want to be able to define m1 as type Mass and enter the expression
m*a/m1 into the interperter to return a of type Length/Time^2 without
having to ever specify any particular mass or acceleration.  But I want
that type information to be carried and used in the calculations - in
fact, it is essential.

> In fact, it is (or should be) a FAQ. See MathAction.

I took a look at the FAQ link, but I might have missed it.  I'll check
again.

But what if I want a to have a specific type, for example limit it to
Quaternions only?

I guess I'm not following why things can't be further restricted by
saying in this particulary case a is of type FOO, and therefore doing
two things:

1)  restricting the evaluation of the polynomial substitutions for a
which are of type FOO

2)  allowing algorithms to use the knowledge that for this polynomial a
is restricted to some subset to make further deductions,
simplifications, and otherwise provide more precise answers

Sorry if this is an obviously trivial question.

Cheers,
CY

Gaby,

Larry Lambe has been trying to build Axiom on a 64-bit SUSE box.
One of the issues he ran into a couple problems and I pointed
him at the build-improvements branch. I'm not sure how you 
handle the X11/lib64 issue.

===============================================================

.....[snip].....

I am running SUSE 10.1, x86_64 and the make fails next by 
looking in X11/lib and not X11/lib64.  Could this be fixed in 
"configure"?  I changes to lib64 manually and the make concluded.  

.....[snip].....

However, it seems that hyperdoc is not working, specifically Browse.  I 
typed "LIST" in the input field, clicked on "Domains" and it asked if I 
wanted to see all domains.  I clicked "yes" and it brought up only 
*PlaneAlgebraicCurvePlot and SingleInteger.  Finally, neither 2D or 3D 
plotting work.  The latter is working in the Sept 2005 version that I 
recompiled on my current system.  Should I try another branch?  Thanks,


t

The build-improvements branch uses automake.
I believe the process is just:

./configure
make

but Gabriel (Gaby) is the author of the new makefiles
and can answer questions about it better than I can.
He's copied here as Gabriel Dos Reis <gdr@integrable-solutions.net>

I don't know exactly what Martin meant with the promise, but think of
the following.

MachineInteger is in libaldor what SingleInteger is in Axiom. For a
particular element of that type you have exactly 32 bits.
Let's appreviate "macro I == MachineInteger;". Now, if you say

m: I;

in the interpreter, the interpreter has to take care of the fact that
this m does not have a value, since any of the 32 bits is reserved for
holding a true MachineInteger. Now assume you do simply

n: I := m + m;

then n does not have a value. However, there is a relation between m and
n. Where do you store that information? Certainly not in MachineInteger.
And hopefully also NOT in the interpreter. There should be a general
domain that handles such things. Something like a typed expression tree
which then could be used by the interpreter to figure out what you mean.
But to write such a domain, is another story.

BTW, why would you want typed variables in the first place?

What you wrote that looked to me like you want to replace the a_i later
with concrete values.

But looking at

m := matrix[[a1,a2],[a3,a4]]

maybe you want

Q == Quaternion Fraction Integer;

m(a1: Q, a2: Q, a3: Q, a4: Q): Matrix Q := matrix[[a1,a2],[a3,a4]];

???

If you want general solving facilities then you actually want m as a
variable and you need to tell the solver what your solution space is.

Ask yourself who should take care about the type knowledge that you give
here. Where would you store that information?

Yes, that is possible. You know, we have discussed that already. We just
do not yet have proper code. The "dimension.as" file that I sent to the
list on 29-Aug-2006 is a first attempt but not as fully functional as
you would like. But don't worry, we come to that. However, I think that
it is not going to work in SPAD.

I build dayly axiom.build-improvements on x86_64-suse-linux.

| I'm not sure how you

This is the same issue as why you special-cased the Makefile for fedora4.

Autoconf has facilities to detect where X11 includes and libraries
are.  In particular it computes all the flags necessary to link
against X11.  The relevant portion of configure.ac.pamphlet on
build-improvements is:

   \section{Where is X11?}

   One of the thorniest issues with programs that use the X Window System
   is portability.  There exist many implementations of the X11
   specification, each with its own variations, extensions, and what
   not.  Designing hand-written, makefiles for such programs can be a
   daunting task, fraut with all kinds of traps.  Fortunately, Autoconf
   provides us with some help, namely the macro [[AC_PATH_X]] and
   [[AC_PATH_XTRA]].  The former searches the directories where the
   include files and the libraries file for X11 reside.  The later is an
   enhanced version that:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item computes the C compiler flags required by X;
   \item computes the linker flags required by X;
   \item checks for special libraries that some systems need in order to
      compile X programs;
   \item checks for special X11R6 libraries that need to be linked before
     the flag [[-lX11]].
   \end{itemize}

   <<locate X11>>=
   AC_PATH_XTRA
   ## Output directives for the C compiler
   AC_SUBST(X_CLFAGS)
   ## Output directives for the linker
   AC_SUBST(X_LIBS)
   ## Output any extra libraries required by X11
   AC_SUBST(X_EXTRA_LIBS)

   ## Finally, output the list of libraries that need to appear before -lX11
   ## Some part of Axiom depends on Xpm.  That library has kind uncertain
   ## future.  At some point in the past, it was deprecated, to be
   ## replaced by xpm-nox; then came back again.  So, its support may
   ## vary from system to system.  For the moment, we assume that if X11
   ## is found then, Xpm is already present.  Though, clearly that is a
   ## very optimistic assumption.  Long term, Axiom should get rid of
   ## dependence on Xpm.  A nearly fool-proof test would be probably
   ## inspired by AC_PATH_XTRA.  I don't have time to get to that
   ## complication right now.  Will fix later.
   X_PRE_LIBS="-lXpm $X_PRE_LIBS"
   AC_SUBST(X_PRE_LIBS)

on build-improvements, hyperdoc is not working because of a path issue
(fixed in --patch-50).  It was low priority for me, but I can fix it
quickly if Larry was to test the build-improvements branch and he
needs it.

Yesterday, it took me very time lines to code some simple symbolic

Wouldn't that information be associated with the variable n?

I must be thinking about this incorrectly.  I was thinking along these
lines:

m : I;  -- Creates a Variable with type MachineInteger.  m doesn't
        -- reserve space for a value in this form because there is
        -- no value - not until an actual value is assigned is the
        -- space needed.

m := 3;  -- Assigns a specific value to m.  m internally is coerced
         -- to a structure which holds not only the type information
         -- as above but also a specific value

n: I := m + m;  -- If m is defined only as m : I, this creates a
             -- variable with type MachineInteger and a value that
             -- is a function of m

> BTW, why would you want typed variables in the first place?

The use that came up on IRC was working with Quaternion matrix elements
and solving a matrix system to find equations, IIRC.  More generally,
mightn't one expect that things like solve algorithms and integration
would be able to use specific type information on variables to arrive
at more specific solutions than more general algorithms could find?

Possible, but also the intent might be to solve for a general symbolic
equation.

Depending on the application, that is another potential use - when I
tried those two lines though, here's what happened:

The problem, as described to me, was having three matrices A, B and C. 
C is known.  The goal was to choose the elements of one of A or B then
look for equations coming from AB-BA = C.  The elements of A and B are
quaternion.

The person who asked the original question subscribed to the list, so
perhaps they can supply more details.

As part of the structure associated with the variable name a1.  Perhaps
I am thinking about Variable incorrectly?

Yes.  I was just using it as an illustration because that is the
problem domain where I am most familiar with the issue ;-).  There are
probably other cases besides that one where such logic would be useful.

I'm inclined to agree.  Anyway, that was just an illustration of a more
general question.  Maybe another case would be integration - if you
know you are only dealing with positive integers as opposed to all
integers couldn't you deal with some integrals that you couldn't
otherwise deal with, in cases where the function isn't well behaved in
the negative numbers but is in the positive?

Cheers,
Cliff

but "n"'s type isn't Variable(some type), it is "some type", meaning,
it holds *values* of that type.  But you want it to hold a token of
some type.  That is a different story.  With systems that do
"symbolic" manipulations, you don't get that trouble; with with
systems like Axiom that do actually computations, you have to go
through an additional indirection.

OK.

Surely that isn't a surprising way to want to use a CAS?

I'm actually surprised something like a1 : Integer would be handled any
other way then as a token with type, but again that may just be me not
knowing enough.

I'm not sure I'm totally clear on the distinction.  After all, Axiom
can do things like integrate(1/(1+x^4),x) and provide a result - how is
that not a symbolic manipulation?

Humm... And you continue to work with this Axiom session, you're
completely crazy :-) I don't know what can I think about the expression
"Q =3D=3D Quaternion Fraction Integer". Nevertheless I think you can repo=
rt
this to IssueTracker, I consider this as critical.

Hello,

Sorry for polluting the axiom-developer mailing list, this is the last
time. May be you know why some mails were accepted (1/3). My ISP was
recently bought by orange.fr so I must, may be, use directly their
address.

Don't know, Kai, why it's sometimes accepted.

Hello,

I just wanted to say that my mail sent to axiom-developer was sent to
you too. I do not know why my first mail was rejected by gmx.de. In fact
they even did not speak about blacklisted thing in response to my first
mail. I'm asking if my ISP has some problems actually, for example I
receive mail from axiom-developer in an incorrect order, may be this is
related.

Oh, I feared that this would cause trouble...

Well that should work, but actually I used Aldor syntax. In Axiom you 
would have to write

Q := Quaternion Fraction Integer;

But note then Q is a variable and could change so if you then say

P := Polynomial Q
p1: P := 1
Q := Integer
p2: P := 1

can you assure that p1=p2? Note, the have the same type P which is 
Polynomial Q. Or will p1 become invalid by assigning Integer to Q?

Well, typing that into Axiom will surely reveal the answer, but could 
you say without doing it?

Oh, I just realised some weakness of Axiom...

P := Polynomial

    Although Polynomial is the name of a constructor, a full type must
       be specified in the context you have used it. Issue )show
       Polynomial for more information.

Seems that not everything is first class... :-(

Oh yes, thank you Martin, that was a stupid mistake of mine.

There is a difference between a symbol and an Integer.

What you want, if I understand your manipulation correctly, is to use
symbols, and only later subsitute some values for those symbols.  And
you want to make sure that the symbols are interpreted in some ways.
But, you can't say that directly in the Axiom type system.  Because
Axiom does not attach advanced types to symbols.

Yes.  Notice that in that context "x" is interpreted as *symbol*, not
as a value.  Your declaration of "n" said it should be interpreted as
standing for a value, but you did not say which.

Maybe you want that... Add the C yourself.
The trick is that you add variables if form of polynomials.

R := Fraction Integer
P := Polynomial R
Q := Quaternion P
M := Matrix Q

A1 := quatern(A11, A1i, A1j, A1k)

A3 := quatern(A31, A3i, A3j, A3k)

Yes and no.  I want it to be a variable, but a variable of a specific
type.  So rather than just saying x is "something" I say it is "some
integer" or "some float".  I thought I was saying that, but apparently
not - do I understand correctly that what I thought I was saying in
fact cannot be said in Axiom at this time?

Right.

Is there a reason it does not, or is just something that hasn't been
implemented?

So what I want then, using your terminology, would be a way to declare
a symbol to have a Type.  The reason a1 : MachineInteger produces the
expectation of a value is that Axiom simply doesn't support a symbol
with a Type, and so that assignment carries with it the assumption that
a1 now has some specific value?

Ouch.  There are many cases where one tries to solve a problem to
arrive at a symbolic equation, not a value.  If Axiom makes this
difficult that's going to be a real problem.

As long as I'm asking basic questions, just how would I go about
defining a function f(x) that took the expression produced by
integrating(1/(1+x^4),x) and numerically evaluated it for the given
value of x?  

Cheers,
CY

I agree with Greg, this should be reported as a bug in IssueTracker.

This subject has come up before.

Tim Daly has referred to this sort of thing as "indefinites". See
for example the email messages in this thread deal specifically
with the issue you raise above:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-06/msg00212.html

It is also mentioned here:

Martin's point is important. This *is* a Frequently Asked Question
about Axiom - particularly by anyone who has used any of the more
"symbolic" and less "computer algebra-oriented" systems such as
Maxima, Maple or Mathematica. There really should be a discussion
of it here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/FAQ

But sense there is not, now would be a good time to at least as
the question. Just click on the link above, read or skip to the
end and "Be Bold" - add a comment that asks the question. Later
someone can add the answer. That is how this wiki FAQ is supposed
to work.

Suppose there was such a domain constructor named Variable(D: domain)
which had the properties you suggest. What operations would you expect
this  domain to export? Would it have the same operations as D? For
example '+'. Given two objects from the domain Variable(Integer),
say 'x' and 'y', what is the type of the result of 'x+y'? Is it
still in Variable(Integer)?

As Tim Daly said in his original replies to me in the email thread
mentioned above, this gets pretty complicated rather quickly.

Expression(R: OrderedSet) is a domain constructor that is intended
to implement many of these sort of expression manipulations
where the *coefficients* of the expressions come from domain R.
For example

(1) -> (a1,a2,a3,a4):Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer
       Type: Void
(2) -> m := matrix[[a1,a2],[a3,a4]]

         +a1  a2+
    (2)  |      |
         +a3  a4+
       Type: Matrix Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer

We did not specify any values for a1, a2, a3, a4, but in the
domain 'Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer' we can use
them to form new expressions of the type and use them in other
types.

Unfortunately something very important that should work here:

(3) -> quatern(1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16)::Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer
   Internal Error
   The function coerce with signature hashcode is missing from domain
      Expression(Quaternion (Fraction (Integer)))

doesn't work due to a bug in the current algebra code. :-(
I guess I had better submit this as a bug to IssueTracker...

Do you mean domains such as InputForm? Many purely symbolic
manipulations (in the sense of Lisp S-expressions) can be
performed in this domain (and related Sexpression). Most Axiom
domains have a coercion to InputForm. I think it is unfortunate,
though that the coercion to OutputForm from InputForm actually
displays these expressions as S-expressions, rather than in
Axiom's usual input notation.

I think very likely this is mostly a result of very poor or
missing documentation about what is possible in Axiom rather
than a fundamental limitation.

I do not think that is correct. If Axiom does not attach types to
symbols, what would you say the following expression means?

(4) -> a1+a2

   (4)  a2 + a1
   Type: Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer

where a1, a2 are defined in (1) above.

No, the situation is more complicated than that as the example (4)
above shows. Note in particular that in (4) a1 and a2 *do not*
have any values (other than the symbol which they implicitly
represent).

When I write:

  a1:Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer

I am saying that a1 is a symbolic expression which includes the
possibility that it be a specific 'Quaternion Fraction Integer' or
some symbol or even some symbolic expression.

This is different than if I wrote:

  a1:Quaternion Fraction Integer

when does not admit that possibility that a1 could be a symbolic
expression.

I do not think that Axiom makes this particularly difficult but it
certainly does things in a way quite different than Mathematica,
Maxima or Maple.

But don't get me wrong. There are some serious limitations on the
ways things of type Expression ... in Axiom can be manipulated when
compared to the 3M's. We have had discussions about this in this
list from time to time over the last few years.

You have to distinguish between "variable of specific type" from
"symbol substituable with values of specifc type".  The former
designates values -- i.e. computations are really done -- whereas the
later has to indicate to the compiler or interpreter to "remember" --
i.e. construct suspession -- for the computation.

I don't know whether there is a good reason why it has been
implemented -- I can explain why it does not work the way you want,
but I have not investigated the feasability of the "solution."

| a symbol to have a Type.  The reason a1 : MachineInteger produces the
| expectation of a value is that Axiom simply doesn't support a symbol

a1 : MachineInteger tells Axiom that somewhere down a1 will designate
an object allocated to hold value of type MachineInteger.  There is 
the domain constructor Expression which you could try to use.
However, I seem to remember Ralf telling people that they should never
ever enter EXPR T in Axiom; so without knowing what you do futher with
your matrix I can't say the EXPR domain constructor is a good way to go;
you have to try.

Going back to your original example, here is what I have:

Thanks Bill and Gaby for very informative replys.  Since I started this
I'll add it to the FAQ ;-).

Thanks for the subst pointer Bill :-).  Sometimes the obvious just

Gaby, do you really believe that? But in order to say x+y you have to
have the type of Variable(D: domain) in the first place. So let's
suppose you simply say (Aldor-speak: PrimitiveType exports just equality)

Variable(D: PrimitiveType): PrimitiveType == add {
   Rep == ...
   (x: %) = (y: %): Boolean == ...
}

So you actually say that Variable is rather thumb. But first you have to
create x and y. So you would say

x: Variable(Integer) := "x"  -- give the name of the symbol
y: Variable(Integer) := "y"

There are already two issues here.

1)
When you just say
x: Variable(Integer)
without the assignment, you just declare an (Aldor/Axiom) identifier, no
value yet. If ever you are going to compute with x it has to have a
value. Now actually the domain Symbol does exactly that. However the lines

(1) -> (a1,a2,a3,a4):Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer
        Type: Void
(2) -> m := matrix[[a1,a2],[a3,a4]]

          +a1  a2+
     (2)  |      |
          +a3  a4+
        Type: Matrix Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer

given by Bill suggest that the Axiom interpreter is a bit more relaxed.
It actually interprets a1 as both, an Axiom identifier and as a variable 
of the domain Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer.

Try

b: Expression Quaternion Fraction Integer := B
B

in Axiom.


2)
Now Gaby said that x+y should have type FreeMonoid Variable Integer. Why 
not FreeGroup? I guess the interpreter has to do a lot of work to find 
the right interpretation for such a + and it must decide for one of 
possibly many choices. But assume I say x+z for
z: Variable(Float) := "z"
what is the type of that? Should the interpreter forbid such an 
addition? In the compiler I clearly don't want any guessing and not 
automatic conversion. Note that I prefer that (most of) the things that 
are possible in the interpreter could be compiled into stand alone programs.
Anyway, if the type tower is always expanded like that  you end up
with the fact that
(x+y)*x and x*x + x*y
have types
FreeMultiplicativeSemigroup FreeAdditiveSemigroup Variable Integer
and
FreeAdditiveSemigroup FreeMultiplicativeSemigroup Variable Integer
and thus are not equal.

And what would be the type of foo?(x,y)? Maybe I have extended Integer 
to contain a function foo: (%, %) -> Boolean. Variable(Integer) does 
however not export anything about its argument. So who is going to find 
out that such a foo exists?

I think that one has to be more careful before judging EXPR that way. I'd
rather say: try to avoid EXPR as much as you can, but there are things which
cannot be handled without.

EXPR QUAT FRAC INT would be the domain of expressions, with coefficients (i.e.,
all "numbers" that appear) being from QUAT FRAC INT.

Internally (and that might be good for understanding), the elements are stored
as fractions of multivariate polynomials with coefficients being QUAT FRAC INT
and symbols being "kernels", i.e., things that cannot be evaluated further.

Cliff, maybe you would be happy with the domain

POLY QUAT FRAC INT?

this one is "safer" - doesn't provide as much functionality though.

by the way, maybe it wasn't explained that way yet:

a: INT,; b: INT; a+b

+ is an operation in INT. it takes its arguments and applies the '+' function
from Lisp. The point is: +$INT was promised that the arguments it gets are
INTs. It's the design of axiom that every operation knows what types its
arguments have. They don't have to check anymore. That's why axiom is fast.

Go to a common lisp and say

(+ a b)

Martin

yes.  My working assumption is that if we had Variable(D: domain) to
mean anything, it would be such that operations of D would be *lifted*
to Variable(D: domain) and would work as if we had an algebra (in the
Universal Algebra sense).  In this case "+" would be lifted to
Variable Integer, so that x + y can be interpreted as an element a a
free monoid generated symbols.  That is not rocket science.

Funny enough, I tried similar thing and sent a message before seeing
Bill's.  That is a natural thing to do if you have a Universal Algebra

I picked FreeMonoid because that is the least assumption with "+" from
Integer.  But I'm OK to have the interpereter go directly to FreeGroup
-- that would be even more consistent with my earlier suggestion of
lifting operations to Variable D.

If "+" is defined as beeing an associative operation , there would not

super smart.  Just lift operations.

The process would be that of lifting operations from D to Variable(D).

Hi Camm,

  currently 'make install' fails for GCL-2.6.8 if the utility

I agree with you that if D had type T then Variable(D) should have type 
T (plus maybe some exports that allow to create "indeterminates").

Looking at it mathematically (and simplified) then all we do is that we 
take a universal algebra D = (A, F) where A is the carrier set and F are 
the functions on it. Variable(D) is maybe a bad name, but all we do is 
that Variable(D) = (A', F') is a universal algebra where A' is the union 
of the set A, a set X of indeterminates, and all things that can be 
generated from A and X by applying functions from F'. F and F' behave 
identically on A.

Mathematically, that's not a big deal. But Aldor domains are actually 
multi-sorted algebras. That makes the situation a little more complicated.

So I still disagree with you that x+y should be of type 
FreeMonoid(Variable(Integer)). From what I said above, it seems more 
natural to me that its type is Variable(Integer) (well, it's a bad name, 
maybe Indefinite(Integer) would be better).

Anyway, what we want is a nice way of adding elements and more or less 
keeping the type of the domain. And that is not possible if you just 
define "Indefinite" having one argument D. One must know the type of D 
(a category) so that the return type would be clear.

Indefinite(C: Catagory)(D: C): C == add {
     Rep == Union(d: D, ???)
     ...
}

The ??? should be something that allows arbitrary expressions formed 
from D, the functions in C and some indeterminates X. (I have no idea 
how that would look like. Maybe just delayed evaluation of function 
composition.)

Maybe. I don't say that shouldn't be allowed in the interpreter, but the 
compiler would generate a matrix of 4 uninitialized entries. Now what 
happens if you print m(1,1)? If that prints something reasonable then it 
tells me that the compiler knows about a special domain constructor, 
namely Expression. Drop "Expression" from above, what would be on screen 
for "stdout << m(1,1)"? The interpreter can add smart things. I am 
asking for the compiler.

Oh, who said that + is associative? The documentation, right? But that 
is not a nice thing to take into account for the compiler. It would be 
much better if Aldor allowed to state associativity in a formal manner.

I am completely with you. The interpreter should not have any 
mathematical knowledge, just look into a database (basically the Axiom 
libraries) and figure out what could be done. It should be possible to 
change the libraries and work with the same interpreter.

Oh, I meant the type of "x+z".

But there was also no addition until you transformed Variable(Integer)

OK, let's turn this into a mathematical example.

A := Fraction Complex Integer; a: A := 1
B := Complex Fraction Integer; b: B := 1

Clearly A and be are isomorphic as fields, but they are NOT identical.
Not identical in Axiom and not identical in mathematics.

Note, we had a discussion whether "Fraction Fraction Integer" should be 
implemented to be the same as "Fraction Integer". Although I had even 
given code to do that, I believe it should not be implemented that way. 
Because an element that looks like (2/1)/(3/1) is NOT identical to 2/3. 
(Just consider fractions as equivalence classes of pairs of some type.

Clearly I have some homework to do on this topic, and it's important
enough that I want to be sure I have the correct sources.  Looking over
the archive links Bill provided (thanks Bill!) it looks like papers by
Davenport and Fateman are recommended reading.  Are these the specific
papers in question?

James H. Davenport and Christ`ele Faure. The "unknown" in computer
algebra. Programmirovanie, 1(1), 1994.
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-06/dviwYbMdboRdU.dvi

R. Fateman. Manipulation of matrices symbolically.
http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/symmat2.pdf

Not sure about this one:
Abstract matrices in symbolic computation
http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1145820&type=pdf&coll=GUIDE&dl=&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618#search=%22Fateman%20matrices%22

I didn't initially appreciate how important (even vital) this topic was
to Axiom.  It looks like this issue will be essential for eventual
support of some very common uses of computer algebra.

Tim, I'm not spotting it in the archives yet - did you ever find the
box with the provisos work in it?


Other links in the archives (I'm sure not comprehensive):

I take it this is the NSF grant?  Papers from this effort will be
interesting:

In this discussion, I'm going to ignore Aldor for a moment and

I don't think it should be Variable(Integer).  For me,
Variable(Integer) means a symbol who interpretation is of type
Integer.  I don't like Indefinite(Integer) neither.  So, it might very
well be that we're back to our old beloved friend Expression(Integer).

If that entry is a Variable? I would expect the output to indicate

I did not transform a variable to FreeMonoid Variable Integer.
However, I did suggest that type  for th _compound expression_ "x+y"

| OK, let's turn this into a mathematical example.
| 
| A := Fraction Complex Integer; a: A := 1

| 
| Clearly A and be are isomorphic as fields, but they are NOT identical.

Under the mathematical interpretation they are the same.  I believe

Yes, they are relevant but not central to the issue that you raised.
In fact the concept of "indefinities" was coined by Tim Daly. After
reading about the idea, I do not think that this formulation of the
issue (which is essentially based on proof theory and logic) is the
right approach for Axiom. Really I would prefer a more "algebraic"
approach. I think the paper by Steven Watt referred to in the
following thread:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00525.html

Making Computer Algebra More Symbolic (Invited), Stephen M. Watt,

Granada Spain.

http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~watt/pub/reprints/2006-tc-sympoly.pdf

is a very important contribution. What he is describing here is
directly related to the implementation of the Expression domain
constructor in Axiom.

Bill Page.

No. The question is: Is it computer science? ;) I am glad that you

The meaning of this statement is unclear to me. Do you mean:
If D has category T then Variable(D) should have category T?
If so, I would disagree. Variable(D), as a universal algebra
over some symbols must have a different (but related) type,
perhaps Variable(D) has Universal(T)?

The interesting thing to me is that all you appear to be doing here
is "re-inventing" the Expression domain constructor.

It seems to me that 'Expression(Integer)' is a good enough name. :-)

I strongly recommend that you take a close look at how Expression is
implemented in the Axiom library.

I think the only reason to "avoid" Expression is because in some
sense it represents a less powerful and less generalizable approach
to computer algebra.

As Martin says, Expression is really implemented internally in
Axiom as 'Fraction MultivariatePolynomial' where the polynomial
symbols include first of all, all symbols (such as the symbols
a1, a2, a3, a4) plus a large number of other expressions, e.g.
'sin(a1)' which are not evaluated any further in the Expression
domain.

Actually the suggestion that the 3M's have anything to do with
Universal Algebra kind of made me "gag" ;) Seriously, I doubt the
implied connection. But it is true that Axiom's Expression domain
constructed was designed specifically to address the type of
"symbolic" calculations often done in these other packages.

No that is not true. In the domain Expression the symbol 'a1'
simply stands for itself. It is not "uninitialized'.

I don't understand. Obviously Expression is a domain that the SPAD
compiler understands. Implementing Expression in Aldor should be
quite straight forward.

Camm,

  Following up on my earlier message, is it OK to apply this to
gcl-2.6.8pre CVS?  I'm using it in the GCL version present in Axiom
build-improvement branch.

Thanks!

Camm,

I spent the day trying to build axiom on the MAC.
GCL builds and generates a lisp image that works.
(I'm using the Xcode development environment).
Unfortunately if you do a save-system the stored
image will NOT work. 

I'm rewriting the Makefiles to handle a pure-lisp
image build.

Tim --

  My understanding, from reading src/lib/Makefile.pamphlet, is that
sockio-c.o is contained in libspad.a.  So why is it specified again
in lsp/Makefile.pamphlet when building a fresh lisp image from GCL?

Also, is there a reason why cfuns-c.o is not archived in libspad.a?

frustration, fatigue, lack of....

oh, you mean the failure? 
the lisp runs fine but the image after the save-system
fails with an illegal instruction. looks like the link
edit failed to fill in a branch somewhere. i played with
GDB for a while but got nowhere.

Can't get Martin's stuff to work, can't get MAC stuff to work.
Made no perceptible progress at all this weekend. sigh.

cfuns-c.o and sockio-c.o get linked directly into the lisp image.
they are required to be part of the image so axiom can talk to sman,
the superman process that managed communication with hyperdoc and
graphics.

We've got the Rosetta document up in html form at
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RosettaStone

Is the LaTeX source code of this also available somewhere?  If so, can
we add a link to it to the wiki page?  I suppose in theory it would be
less current but it would be nice to have available.  If the copyright
on it permits, mightn't this also make a good appendix in the Axiom
Tutorial?

Cheers,
CY

Yes, but then what about the copy of cfuns-c.o in libspad.a (which is
also specified along with cfuns-c.o)?

I guess another way to phrase my question is what is the difference
between specifying an object file directly, from as included via
libspad.a?

Thanks Tim.  I added a comment to the RosettaStone page - I can't seem
to edit the page itself, perhaps because of the large number of <a
href= type entries?

Is anyone else seeing a problem with the formatting of the comments on
the RosettaStone wiki page or is it just my browser?

By the way, what is the best/preferred way to handle this page - edit
the pamphlet file and then update the wiki page, or edit the wiki page
and occasionally go back and edit the pamphlet file?

Cheers,
CY

Yes, probably. We still have the pain caused by spam to deal with. :(
Right now to edit these pages with many links you must have a Zope
user id and password.

No it is not your browser. The formatting was a little strange because
this page used the old HTML page type. To be formatted properly comments
would have to be written in HTML. This is a limitation of the Zwiki
software. But I have just change the page type to allow StructuredText
so the comments should be ok now.

This page

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RosettaStone

was the result of an early experiment to convert LaTeX to HTML before
we had support for pamphlets on the wiki. The result of the conversion
is one really large page which is very slow to load. Perhaps we should
either do a better job of conversion to HTML (multiple pages) or maybe
just replace it with the pamphlet version?

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/doc/Rosetta

At least that would simplify the online edit issue. I could also probably
eliminate the ban on links inside pamphlet files since spammers are
unlikely to go to the trouble of editing LaTeX/noweb pages. (There would
still be a restriction in the comments section of the pamplet page.)

What do you think?

Regards,
Bill Page.

the lisp has to have some sort of extern linkage reference 
in order to choose the .o file from the archive. clearly there
is nothing in GCL that references those symbols as externs
so if you add libspad.a in the standard GCL linkage no .o
file will be selected from the archive.

but when the cfuns and sockio are included in the image
then the symbols they contain can be referenced by lisp
code which is written at run time.

axiom contains lisp code that uses the symbols externed by
cfuns and sockio.

Aha!  So, in fact we can just remove libspad.a from that list since

That's OK for me. But it is easier for me to speak Aldor, because it has 
a reasonable language description. I am not at all fluent in SPAD, so 
maybe we need a translator sometimes.

OK, I can live with that. But that is saying that you don't just *lift* 
the operations from Integer to Variable(Integer). In Integer you would have

+: (%, %) -> %;

in Variable(Integer) you'd have

+: (%, %) -> FreeMonoid %;

So that is saying, for each operation you have to figure out the right 
return type. And since the signatures belong to the argument of the 
function "Variable", you'd have to build a universal constructor 
("Variable") that does this for arbitrary arguments.

Good luck to figure out the return type foo for Variable(MyInteger) and

MyInteger: IntegerType with {foo: %->%} == Integer add {foo(x:%):%==x}

No, definitely not. The difference to Expression Integer is that the 
"Integer" in the argument says something about the coefficients in the 
internal representation (Remember Axiom stores Expression(D) as a 
quotient of multivariate polynomials over D in "kernels" as variables.)
So Expression(D) does NOT say anything about the variables. In fact, I 
believe that the argument of Expression is more or less only there for 
technical reasons. The domains Expression(Integer) and Expression(Float) 
or Expression(AlgebraicNumber) are all different. But an element of

Expression SUP Integer

could as well live in Expression Integer. Expression in Axiom is a way 
to remove type information. Good for interactive stuff, but I still 
believe that people should be more specific (ie add appropriate types) 
when they write libraries.

So what I want (and I think also you want that) is such a lifting 
procedure where the *types of the variables* would be known. So the 
whole expression whould type-check. It's a kind of TypedExpression 
domain. Expression and TypedExpression looks similar to lamda calulus 
and typed lambda calculus to me.

Because that would require that each domain exports its category. 
Remember, Aldor does not have reflection. You get D and currently the 
only way to ask something about the type of D is

    D has CATX

Of course that is not useful since you'd have to know the exports of D 
at the time you write the program. That's much too early.

As explained above, Expression D is NOT what you want.

Oh, please don't quote Axiom or any other system, I know they are 
relaxed and do what you expect. But look carefully at what you have 
written above, translate that into C, then you see that you have never 
given a1 a value, so the memory location is probably the nil pointer.

I quite like the distinction in the abstract of

http://portal.axiom-developer.org/refs/articles/TheUnknownInComputerAlgebra.dvi

Above a1,a2,a3,a4, and m are "programming variables" and interestingly 
there is actually no "mathematical symbol" specified above. The axiom 
interpreter now is smart and treats (1) as a definition of symbols that 
are called by the same name.

You see the difference if you type

)clear all
a1: Expression Integer := B

Maybe I was not clear enough. I meant, that then the compiler has the 
Expression domain built-in. That would be something that I would not 
really like. The compiler and the interpreter should not know about 
mathematics. You can easily implement Expression as a library package 
and that is where it belongs.

I am really curious, what model you have. What should

properties()$Integer

return?

I meant that the documentation is not formal enough for a compiler.

Sorry, if you mean that, that is not formal enough for me. You just 
declare commutative("*") and you are done. If you start with the Peano 
Axioms then commutativity is not a declaration it requires a proof. So 
it's a theorem. What I would like to have is to state the theorem and 
hand it to a prover (who then spits out that * is commutative).

Good to hear that we are on the same side.

Ah, you said it. You have a map inbetween to make things equal, namely
the "interpretation".

Maybe the above is not the best example, but I very much believe that
there are situations where one person wants to consider two things as
equal and another doesn't. They might have different focus. So if you
"design" the two things (like A and B) to be ALWAYS equal, you basically
prevent the second person from finding your CAS appropriate for his work.

> | Not identical in Axiom and not identical in mathematics.

Let Z denote integer.

Let R denote a ring then C(R), the complex numbers over R is defined as
R[x]/(x^2+1). Let E and I denote the equivalence classes of 1 and x in
C(R) then an element of C(R) can be written as x*E+y*I.

Let R denote a ring without zero divisors. Then Q(R) is defined as
R^2/~ where (x,x') ~ (y,y') :<==> xy'=x'y. The equivalence class of
(x,x') in Q(R) is written as x/x'.

An element in A=Q(C(Z)) looks like (x*E+y*I) / (u*E+v*I).
An element in B=C(Q(Z)) looks like (x/y)*E + (u/v)*I.

(x,y,u,v all elements of Z)

If you now say that you can find two elements of A and B that are
mathematically equal (what does that mean, by the way?), then you
basically try to find a way to make them equal.

If you say that A=B that requires a proof.

A simpler example is Z itself. N is constructed by the peano axioms.
Z = N^2/~ where (m,n) ~ (m',n') :<==> m+n' = m'+n.

By construction, if n\in N then n \not\in Z.

Very often we say something like

   By abuse of notation we identify n and the class  [(n,0)] in Z and
   simply write n\in Z.

I haven't seen any computer algebra system that has addressed such
"abuse of notation". Actually all just abuse the notation and one cannot
do things that where not designed into the system. (It's a different
type of problem, but note how difficult it is to teach Maple or
Mathematica that your * is not commutative.)

What is THE mathematical interpretation?

I am sure William Sit can elaborate on this.

Could you tell in which sense this has to do with dependent types? You 
also don't want

SparseUnivariatePolynomial SparseUnivariatePolynomial Integer

to be just

SparseUnivariatePolynomial Integer

You are mixing things. Let's suppose 3, 2, 5 are from Integer. Then 
there is +: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer. So we can simply apply that 
function to 3 and 2. Why would you forbid that?

The above is different.

First let's make it equal. If you type (2/1) and (3/1) they are of type 
Fraction Integer. Fraction Integer is a field and allows the operation 
/: (%, %) -> %. So that operation can be applied and yields 2/3.

Now make it different. If I interpret the second / in (2/1)/(3/1) as 
/$Fraction(Fraction Integer) (note that Fraction(S) has an operation 
/:(S,S)->%), then (2/1)/(3/1) is simply an element of 
Fraction(Fraction(Integer)) and is not equal to 2/3 because it has a 
different type.

For some reason the Axiom designers decided to put some knowledge into 
the interpreter which forbids to build "Fraction(Fraction(Integer))".
(But you agreed to put no such knowledge into interpreter or compiler. 
Or do you change your mind now?)

Currently properties() take basic operators -- see the doc.

In in the system I see I would like properties('+ $ Integer) to report

yes, but you can't completly remove documentation.  All you can wish

yes, just as you declare axioms for your mathematical structures.  You
certainly don't want people to prove their axioms?

If I start there, then probably.  But what if I do not?

I don't.

That is good for one use of the system.  For another use, I don't

and does the job.

This is not an alien story to mathematician.  Start by assuming
something, and progress.  Latter you can prove that something from
more "primitive" blocks.  But, the real practice rarely is starts from
"primitives" and head directly to the final bits.

Let's make it simple. Integer is a Ring. Don't you want that Integer 
together with "indefinite integers" also form a ring? I don't think that 
I would want Universal(Ring). What is Universal, by the way?

I understand that "indefinite" thing just as a way to encode a delayed 
evaluation. In the "computation" that is done just with the type 
information, you can do any tricks that you can do with that 
information, but if that computation needs a value, it has to wait until 
I provide one. The point is, that you cannot apply an arbitrary 
operation on these indefinite objects. For example if I have a very 
restricted scope and not / operation can be seen then the compiler 
should reject to compile a/b for indefinite integers a and b.

I don't think that my statement is much related to Aldor. You could 
replace Aldor by Axiom or SPAD, if you like. So what did you actually mean?

But inside Expression(Integer) the variables have NO type information

Thank you. But Expression is not what solves the "indefinite" problem.

OK, let's take

n: Expression Integer := n
z := sin(2* %Pi * n)

Axiom knows, in fact, nothing about the n. But if it really knew that n 
is an Integer, it could simplify z to 0.

That should be a test case for indefinite computation.

Of course the Expression type is known. But is should not be built-in 
into the compiler. It should live in a library.

if we are discussing abstract unknown "things" in general, then the

However, here you put forward a very specific example.  Which, as far
as I can determine, does not support your claim.

| Let Z denote integer.

Ralf, for an integral domain D, Quotient(Quotient(D)) = Quotient(D),
where Quotient is the "quotient field functor".

[...]

think "coerce".  Now, a practical issue is whether I would want that
corce to be built-in or library.  For efficient reasons, I would
prefer it built-in -- until systems have progress to the point where
they attain zero abstraction penalty.

Another issue is whether the disction is practically useful.  Here,
opinions vary.

| 
| Could you tell in which sense this has to do with dependent types? 

dependent types will depend on *values*, not just syntactic objects.
Consequently, when you compare types, you don't just compare them on
syntax, but on their canonical values.
Fraction is idempotent for integral domains.

| You also don't want
|

| 
| SparseUnivariatePolynomial Integer

what is the connection?

| 
| You are mixing things. Let's suppose 3, 2, 5 are from Integer. Then

| function to 3 and 2. Why would you forbid that?

I would not.  I'm just using the same logic you used to say that
(2/1)/(3/1) is NOT identical to 2/3.

| The above is different.
| 
| First let's make it equal. If you type (2/1) and (3/1) they are of
| type Fraction Integer. Fraction Integer is a field and allows the
| operation /: (%, %) -> %. So that operation can be applied and yields
| 2/3.
| 
| Now make it different. If I interpret the second / in (2/1)/(3/1) as
| /$Fraction(Fraction Integer) (note that Fraction(S) has an operation
| /:(S,S)->%), then (2/1)/(3/1) is simply an element of
| Fraction(Fraction(Integer)) and is not equal to 2/3 because it has a
| different type.

that is a weakness, non-sense in the "type system", not anything
fundamentally, and mathematically, meaningful.

Assume you have thaught the system to understand that Fraction is
idempotent on integral domains.  Why would you still have that problem?

| For some reason the Axiom designers decided to put some knowledge into

| (But you agreed to put no such knowledge into interpreter or
| compiler. Or do you change your mind now?)

Why do you think I would have changed my mind when you scrupulously base
your deduction of partial fragments of what I want?

As I said, I want the system powerfull enough to understand algebraic
properties, in particular idempotency.  Also, think of commuting
constructors, that is another area where you have lot of troubles.

My preference would be the pamphlet version, for the simple reason that
it is better to have one version that everyone keeps up to date. 
Multiple versions in different places is likely to result in one
becoming "current" and the other one getting progressively older,
unless there is an automatic sync between the two.

That sounds good to me.  Thanks Bill!

OK, I want it exactly so. But now you are saying yourself that the type=20

Yep, exactly what I said. In Variable(D), Category of D in and Category=20
of D out. So the type of Variable (or Indefinite) would be... hmm I need =

an extra argument... (aaaahhh, I had that yesterday...)

Indefinite(C: Catagory)(D: C): C =3D=3D add {

How do you declare a symbolic variable in SPAD? As a demonstration, a=20
short program

---BEGIN aaa.spad
)abbrev package RHXPKG RHxPkg

RHxPkg(): with
   foo: Integer -> Expression Integer
  =3D=3D add
   foo(n: Integer): Expression Integer =3D=3D
     k: Expression(Integer) -- :=3D "x"::Symbol :: Expression(Integer)
     n*k
---END aaa.spad

The two minus signs inside the code are delibarate!
Start Axiom, say
)compile aaa.spad
foo(3)
and be surprised.

Of course. I stick to the LP paradigm. I am not a computer and computers =

Well, I know we don't start always from zero, but we should always have=20
a knowledge base in the background and your definitions and theorems are =

based on that knowledge base. If the commutativity proof is inside the=20
base then fine, otherwise you are not doing mathematics.

Neither do I, but state the basic Axioms (which would be hardware=20
integers or GMP) and then go from there. So commutativity in that case=20
would be an axiom.

Right.

I don't understand. What I said *is* the lifting semantics. If there is 
no / on Integer there is not / on Indefinite(Integer). That's what I said.

Would you agree that one should try to have say a Ring (integers) and
another algebraic structure (indeterminates) which might have several
attirbutes (associative, power associative, alternative, commutative,
ring, group,....) and that one builds up a new algebra from the
(semi/direct) product of the two algebraic structures at hand.

The diagram in a previous mail wants to define a sort of functor, but then
one has to specify the target category cxarefully! I do not beliefe that
there is such a generalization, usually one has to put severe restrictions
of tyhe nature and number of indeterminates to be able to construct
meaningfull algebraic objects.

Please go ahead with your refreshing discussion...

correct? i don't know. the C connections and dependencies can be quite
subtle (e.g. PLF usage). i can't say without checking but at some time
we, the original axiom developers, or i, when recovering axiom, thought
that it was needed. i could be wrong.

the only way to be sure is to eliminate it and then test.

Well, this "indefinite" (not indeterminate) is not my invention. I was 
just elaborating on what I believe I could be.

If you use "indeterminate" as the x in a univariate polynomial ring R[x] 
then (as I understand it) this is not the "indefinite" thing we are 
talking about. This x lives in R[x] but not in R.

Whoever wanted "indefinite things" should speak for himself, I only try 
to explain what I think they could be.

Of course it is possible to model indefinites by indeterminates, but you 
see that your domain now gets bigger. Indefinite integers are integers 
in every respect but the don't have a value (yet). In that sense the 
diagram is OK in my eyes.

But maybe the whole thing needs more elaboration.

If I understand the whole business correctly, then it is NOT an 
indeterminate.

I think, I said something like that here.

At various places in the Axiom (Jenks) book there are supposed to
be multiple images on the page. Nothing I tried would place an 
image where I wanted it. Images "float" and tend to move to the
previous or next page and I'm unable to stop this behavior.

If you're interested take a look at the Jenks book for a page
that contains multiple images and then look at the latex code
in src/doc. See if you can reproduce the multiple image page.

Hi Tim,

I see book.pamphlet and bookvol1.pamphlet in src/doc. What is what?

Actually, I finde it quite confusing that there are two files that look 
nearly identical on the first pages and then differ completely.

 From what I read in the Makefile, book.pamphlet is the file you want me 
to look at.

I have the original Axiom book on my desk and see (section 7.1.2) two 
graphics on page 183, but no graphic at all in section 7.1.2 in book.dvi.

Another point is that the original Axiom book is printed with a big 
margin that sometimes holds explanatory text. Seems that book.pamphlet 
is not the original source since that text on the top-left of page 183 
is not tagged as such. Do you still have the original source somewhere?

Ralf

book.pamphlet is the Jenks book.
boovol1.pamphlet is Axiom Volume 1, the Tutorial

All 10 planned volumes of the Axiom series will start out with the
same "look and feel". It's what book series like the 'for dummies'
or the O'Rielly series do.

Yes

Because I couldn't put both graphics on the same page.
That's the problem I mentioned.
No matter what I do the graphics "float" to other pages.
I'm sure it is possible to do (since we did it) but I can make it work.

No. I never got the original latex sources. The book was recreated by me 
by hand from multiple file sources. It took approximately 4 months.

Are you planning to be one the skype conference call?

In bookvol1.pamphlet, the figures all look like
 \begin{figure}[htbp]
 ...
 \end{figure}
If you start the placement specifier with an exclamation point,
 \begin{figure}[!htbp]
 ...
LaTeX will try extra hard to put the float where you ask.
Or, I suppose, there's no reason why the image has to be in a float;
you could just insert it where you want.

I actually don't see a problem with having multiple pictures on one page.

The biggest problem is that AXIOM does not produce bounding boxes in the 
.ps file, so one must handcode that in the .tex file. (Which I have 
tried in the attached file.)

Hope that helps.

\section{Two-Dimensional Graphics}
\label{ugGraphTwoD}

The Axiom two-di\-men\-sion\-al graphics package provides the ability
to \index{graphics!two-dimensional} display
\begin{itemize}
\item curves defined by functions of a single real variable
\item curves defined by parametric equations
\item implicit non-singular curves defined by polynomial equations
\item planar graphs generated from lists of point components.
\end{itemize}

These graphs can be modified by specifying various options, such as
calculating points in the polar coordinate system or changing the size
of the graph viewport window.

\subsection{Plotting Two-Dimensional Functions of One Variable}
\label{ugGraphTwoDPlot}

\index{curve!one variable function} The first kind of
two-di\-men\-sion\-al graph is that of a curve defined by a function
$y = f(x)$ over a finite interval of the $x$ axis.

\boxed{4.6in}{
\vskip 0.1cm
The general format for drawing a function defined by a formula $f(x)$ is:
\begin{center}
{\tt draw(f(x), x = a..b, {\it options})}
\end{center}

where $a..b$ defines the range of $x$, and where {\it options}
prescribes zero or more options as described in
\ref{ugGraphTwoDOptions} on page~\pageref{ugGraphTwoDOptions}.  An
example of an option is $curveColor == bright red().$ An alternative
format involving functions $f$ and $g$ is also available.\\
}

A simple way to plot a function is to use a formula.  The first
argument is the formula.  For the second argument, write the name of
the independent variable (here, $x$), followed by an ``{\tt =}'', and the
range of values.

Display this formula over the range $0 \leq x \leq 6$.
Axiom converts your formula to a compiled function so that the
results can be computed quickly and efficiently. 

\spadgraph{draw(sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x)),x = 0..6)}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
{\rm draw(sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x)),x = 0..6)\\}
\vskip 0.2cm
\includegraphics[scale=0.5,bb=0 0 300 300]{ps/2D1VarA.ps}
\caption{$sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x))\ \ \ x = 0 \ldots6$}
\end{figure}
{\rm
\par
Notice that Axiom compiled the function before the graph was put
on the screen.

Here is the same graph on a different interval.\\

draw(sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x)),x = 10..16)\\
}
\vskip 0.2cm
\spadgraph{draw(sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x)),x = 10..16)}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5,bb=0 0 400 400]{ps/2D1VarB.ps}
\caption{$sin(tan(x)) - tan(sin(x))\ \ \ x = 10 \ldots16$}
\end{figure}

Once again the formula is converted to a compiled function before any
points were computed.  If you want to graph the same function on
several intervals, it is a good idea to define the function first so
that the function has to be compiled only once.

This time we first define the function.
\spadcommand{f(x) == (x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3) }
%\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3,bb=0 0 300 300]{ps/2D1VarD.ps}
%\end{figure}
\returnType{Type: Void}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4,bb=14 14 188 199]{ps/2D1VarD.ps}
%\hspace*{\baseLeftSkip}\special{psfile=ps/2Dctrl.ps}

To draw the function, the first argument is its name and the second is
just the range with no independent variable.
\spadgraph{draw(f, 0..4) }
% window was 300 x 300
\includegraphics[scale=0.3,bb=0 0 295 295]{ps/2D1VarD.ps}

Yes. At least a Ring but it will also be something else as you
said parenthetically above "plus maybe some exports that allow to
create indeterminates".

It is some category constructor that I was imagining might be
definable. This constructor adds the required additional exports.

I am not sure how to distinquish "tricks" from "computation".
Perhaps you mean purely symbolic manipulation of expressions
versus the appliction of algebraic operators defined by some
underlying domain?

What you call "delayed evaluation" (in a computer science sense)
has something to do with universal algebra in a a mathematical
sense. We need a mathematics (algebra) "large enough" to express
this notion.

What I meant was that you should look at how the algebra (such as
Expression) is implemented in Axiom now. I would prefer to replace
Aldor by SPAD for the purposes of this dicussion since Axiom's
algebra is currently implemented in SPAD even though we are
generally confident that it can be re-written in Aldor.

You understand that instead of talking about Expression(Integer), as
long as we do not introduce any functions, we can use instead just
Polynomial, right? (Substituting EXPR for POLY below gives the same
result.) But if we talk about POLY, it's implementation is already
clear in Aldor.

In Axiom I can write:

(1) -> a1:POLY INT
       Type: Void

(2) -> a1:=1

   (2)  1
        Type: Polynomial Integer

(3) -> a1:=1.1

   Cannot convert right-hand side of assignment 1.1
   to an object of the type Polynomial Integer of the left-hand
   side.

I want to think of 'a1' as the "typed variable". We can write:

(3) -> a2:POLY INT
       Type: Void

(4) -> (a1+a2)@POLY(INT)

   (4)  a2 + 1
   Type: Polynomial Integer

But

(5) -> (a1/a2)@POLY(INT)

   An expression involving @ Polynomial Integer actually evaluated to
   one of type Fraction Polynomial Integer . Perhaps you should use
   :: Polynomial Integer .

-----------

I used '@POLY(INT)' because I wanted to tell the Axiom interpreter not
to look of other coercions which would have made the interpretation
of '/' possible but no longer in 'POLY INT'.

Should we say that 'a1' represents an indefinite integer? Tentatively,
I think so.

You are right. Expression is too general. Not all objects in
'Expression Integer' evaluate to Integer. How about 'Polynomial
Integer'? Maybe it is to restrictive and we could admit at least
some other expressions not in 'Polynomial Integer' which do
evaluate to Integer?

I do not agree that Axiom knows nothing about n. It knows for
example that a1 has been assigned a value but that a2 has not.

(6) -> )di prop a1
Properties of a1 :
   Declared type or mode:   Polynomial Integer
   Value (has type Polynomial Integer):  1
(6) -> )di prop a2
Properties of a2 :
   Declared type or mode:   Polynomial Integer

---------

I agree that Axiom should be able to simplify

   z := sin(2* %Pi * a2)

to 0 (where a2 is any polynomial with integer coefficients). But
Axiom does not even simplify

   z := sin(2* %Pi)

to 0. When should such a simplification take place? In general
Axiom's 'simplify' operations are quite weak.

??? Expression is not "built-in" to the SPAD compiler.

Does this mean that an indefinite integer couldn't be substituted in
anywhere a "definite" integer could be used?

Not at all. There is not such thing as a daft question -
however always keep in mind that the same is not true of
answers. :-)

No. The issue here is that what we want to call "indefinite integer"
has to come from some domain in Axiom. My proposal is that to define
this in algebraic terms what we need is a domain like Polynomial which
consists of some symbols and expressions (of a specific kind) over
these symobls. So it is clear, right? that the type

  Polynomial Integer

consists of a large clase of expressiions of that type. And saying

  a1:Polynomial Integer

is just a way of saying that the variable a1 will take values from
this domain.

But because the coefficients of the polynomial must come from the
domain Integer we know that these Integers are embedded in this class
of expressions as polynomials of degree 0, so we have no problem
specifying that a certain variable suchs as 'a1' is exact such an
integer (polynomial of degree 0).

In general both Integer and Polynomial Integer has Ring so, yes
it is true that Polynomial Integer can be used in (most) places
where would like to use Integer (but were no specific value is
required).

The only concern I have is whether or not Polynomial Integer is
"big enough" to model everything that we would want to mean by
"indefinite integer".

Bill Page.

X-List-Received-Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2006 19:07:45 -0000

Participants: Kai Kaminski, Gabriel Dos Reis, Bill Page, Tim Daly
Start: 1pm
End: 2pm

1) Bill looked into the details of SVN/SVK on axiom-developer.org
   but has not yet succeeded in building an installation. 

2) Tim looked at porting Axiom to the MAC. 

   There is an outstanding GCL issue. GCL save-system cannot save
   images that will execute successfully. 

   Bill suggested trying to use compiler-link instead.
   This will be investigated.

3) Tim spent time this weekend looking into Martin's build issues
   without success.

   Suggestion that Jose send a diff of his changes to --patch-50
   so Tim can see what approach he was taking

4) The multiple-image-per-page issue with the original book was discussed.
   Kai suggested fixing the postscript files so they all contain the
   bounding box. Tim didn't think that was going to affect the floating
   issue in Latex but Tim was going to review it anyway.

5) Indefinites. 

   Tim mentioned that indefinites could be done using provisos.

   Bill objected that provisos was a proof-theoretic approach
   and that an algebraic approach might be more axiom-like.
   Thus, express Indefinite(Integer) as a Poly(Int) domain if there
   was sufficient coverage.

   Kai thought that both approaches were needed.

6) Kai has a student who wants to work on provisos.
   Tim agreed to share work with the student.

7) Tim did not yet recover the solaris changes.

   Bill pointed out that the solaris port could happen in two
   different environments, a standard solaris and a solaris with
   the GNU tool chain. He feels that the Build-improvements path
   would be more fine-grained rather than the global decision
   approach used by Gold. Thus the solaris port work is better
   left to Build-improvments.

8) Bill tried to build GCL-2.6.8pre on Windows without success.
   He points out that the older versions of GCL will no longer
   build and the fault is likely somewhere in his build setup.

9) Google objects to having binaries in the zips directory.
   It was agreed that since Google was only a method of getting
   around the breakage of Sourcforge SVN and that we plan to put
   SVN on axiom-developer therefore we should ignore Google going
   forward.

10) Gaby pointed out that SVK was more efficient than SVN
    Bill will look at SVK in more detail. There appears to be a
    Perl dependency that is at issue.

    Bill and Gaby will pursue this offline.

Tim will be generally unavailable until next monday evening.
The next scheduled conference call will be announced later.

Tim, for the group

I am afraid that what I wrote below might be a good example of
a "daft answer" - even if it is in the right spirit... :(

This idea needs more work. On 2nd thought what I wrote below
does not make good sense as it stands. Maybe this is better:


(2) -> a1:MPOLY([a1,a2],INT)
       Type: Void

(3) -> a2:MPOLY([a1,a2],INT)
       Type: Void

(4) -> a1+a2

   (4)  a1 + a2
        Type: MultivariatePolynomial([a1,a2],Integer)

This way it is clear that there are no indeterminants that are
not integers.

Bill Page.

Should the project be deleted from: http://code.google.com/p/axiom/ ?

Tim --

Many thanks for posting the summary of the conference.

Below I add a small precision.

Of course, no distiction.

Right. Let's make it clearer. Suppose we just take one operation. For 
simplicity let's take +. Let's take the Integers Z as a carrier set and 
define the universal algebra U = (Z, +) where + works on Z as usual. Let 
us introduce just one indefinite integer x. That means we form
(Z', +') where Z' is a superset of Z and +' restricted to Z is +.
Z' is the term algebra constructed from
Z union {x}  and the function symbol +'
where it is understood that u+'v is always replace by the actual integer 
sum u and v if they are both elements of Z.

If you want more indefinite integers, then iterate that process.

Who would be satisfied with such a way of modelling indefinite integers 
and who would not?

But note that Integer also has a operation zero?: Integer -> Boolean. So 
Z' should also deal with that. But we all know that Aldor/Axiom/SPAD 
domains are not just universal algebras but multisorted.

I think the Expression constructor is a clever thing. In particular, 
here at RISC are several people who deal with symbolic summation. There 
one analyzes the (Mathematica) expression and basically forms a rational 
function domain which is basically something like Expression(Integer) is 
in Axiom.

Don't worry, I can read SPAD, but it's terribly more complicated than 
Aldor for me.

Well, I would agree, if the interpreter knows how to deal with such 
"programming variables" that have no values, but neither SPAD nor Aldor 
understand that.

Have you ever typed

foo(n: Integer): Expression Integer == (k: Expression(Integer); n*k)
foo 1

into Axiom? (Save your session before doing it.)

>> But Expression is not what solves the "indefinite" problem.

No, that is not the problem. Assume that a1 is an indefinite integer.
zero?(a1) shouldn't evaluate to Integer. The point is that although you 
don't know the value of a1, the interpreter/compiler should only allow 
you to write foo(a1) if there is a function

foo: Integer -> SomeResultType

and otherwise tell you that you are doing nonsense. Note that in 
Expression(Integer) you can apply any function to a "kernel" since no 
type information is available. And another difference is: If a1 is an 
indefinite integer and e1 is an indefinite expression involving a1 then 
although you have no value, it is completely clear what type the result 
will have if you plug in a certain integer for a1 into e1. For an 
arbitrary expression from Expression(Integer) you cannot do that.

Why do you think an expression/polynomial that involves indefinite 
integers must evaluate to an integer? zero?(a1) would evaluate to 
Boolean, and that would be perfectly fine for me.

But that is the interpreter and not SPAD itself.

No! That would be WRONG.
Assume that the polynomial domain is Z[x] 
SparseUnivariatePolynomial(Integer). And let f: Z[x] -> Q be the 
homomorphism of rings that maps Z[x] to the rational numbers 
(Fraction(Integer)). f should map x to 1/4. Now assume that a2=x.

sin(%Pi * a2) does not simplify to 0 in general. But if the interpreter 
"knows" that a2 is an integer, the simplification is safe.

In my opinion we should keep our options open and not delete the Google
project - at least not yet. A presence on Google is very high profile and
could have some advantages in the long run even if they are too stingey
with disk space to host our existing entire Axiom source archive.

In spite of planning the mirror the SourceForge SVN archive on
axiom-developer.org, I think maintaining a smaller archive on Google -
containing only the most experimental branch, i.e. build-improvements,
is still a good idea.

Of course this needs someone to manage it and keep it up to date
with the main build-improvements branch on SourceForge (or axiom-
developer). So we can only go with option if someone like you, Alfredo,
is willing to take on this task.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Ah... I forgot to say... if ever indefinite integers come to life then a 
syntax like

i: Integer

would be quite acceptable/preferrable.

Maybe I am wrong, but is there use for indefinite integers in library 
code or is that rather a use case for an interactive session?

If it's only for an interactive session, then I believe the interpreter 
should be made so smart to deal with "programming variables" (like the i 
above) that have no values as indefinite objects.

Note that even if SingleInteger just has 32 bits to store a value, the 
interpreter adds some knowledge anyway (name of the variable that holds 
the SingleInteger, the type of the value, etc.). So it would be simple 
for the interpreter to add another bit saying that this particular 
variable does not have a value.

If I look at

(1) -> n: Integer
 
Type: Void
(2) -> sin(2*%Pi*n)

    n is declared as being in Integer but has not been given a value.

then I believe the interpreter already does that. It just is not smart 
enough to apply the information it has.

Ralf

Well, I just finished building using patch-49 as Bill suggested me.
Hyperdoc worked fine after doing just one step, which using patch-50
it was breaking for me (I am really sorry Martin :-( ). I would like to
know if Martin was using patch-49, that can also confirm the but if
there is any.

So my steps were as indicated by Martin:

1) Copy the files I sent you (i.e., mantepse.spad.pamphlet, fffg.spad.pamphlet,
  rec.spad.pamphlet, Makefile.pamphlet, exposed.lsp.pamphlet) into

  GoldenAxiom/src/algebra

(files are attached to this email).

2) edit Makefile.pamphlet as follows: replace

<<USERLAYER>>=

USERLAYER=\
 ${OUT}/FAMR2.o   \
 ${OUT}/FFFG.o    \
 ${OUT}/FFFGF.o   \
 ${OUT}/NEWTON.o  \
 ${OUT}/RECOP.o   \
 ${OUT}/UFPS.o    \
 ${OUT}/GOPT.o    \
 ${OUT}/UFPS1.o   \
 ${OUT}/GOPT0.o   \
 ${OUT}/GUESS.o   \
 ${OUT}/GUESSINT.o \
 ${OUT}/GUESSF1.o \
 ${OUT}/GUESSF.o  \
 ${OUT}/GUESSP.o
@

by

USERLAYER=\
 ${OUT}/FAMR2.o   \
 ${OUT}/FFFG.o    \
 ${OUT}/NEWTON.o  \
 ${OUT}/RECOP.o   \
 ${OUT}/UFPS.o    \
 ${OUT}/GOPT.o    \
 ${OUT}/GUESSF1.o
@

3) build axiom (i.e., go to Goldenaxiom, say ./configure, do what configure
  tells you to, say make)

Using patch 50 at this point Hyperdoc doesnt work anymore.

Regards,

Alfredo

One possibility that occurs to me is the definition of physics
equations, which might be able to make good use of indefinites. 
Looking at what Feyncalc would need to be workable in Axiom is probably
a good starting point to determine if indefinites would be useful in a
library.  Checking user defined Maple and Mathematica packages might
also be of interest.

If = means "are isomophic as fields" then I agree. If = means 
"identical" then I don't agree. I don't even agree that it exists *THE* 
"quotient field functor". A lot of things in mathematics are "equal" up 
to isomorphism. Whether a person wants to see something as equal or not 
very much depends on his/her focus.

In Axiom I can say

z: Integer := 1
q: Fraction Integer := 1
b: Boolean := z = q

in SPAD I would have to say

b: Boolean := (z :: Fraction(Integer)) = q

for the last line.

So in some sense Axiom addresses this "abuse of notation" issue.
And it "supports" it by forbidding me to define two functions

---BEGIN aaa.input
foo(x: Integer): Boolean == true
foo(y: Fraction Integer): Boolean == false
---END aaa.input

)clear all
)read aaa.input
(3) -> foo(1$Integer)
    Compiling function foo with type Fraction Integer -> Boolean

    (3)  false

(4) -> foo(1$Fraction(Integer))

    (4)  false


Whereas SPAD allows it.

---BEGIN bbb.spad
)abbrev package RHXPKG RHxPkg

RHxPkg(): with
   foo: Integer -> Boolean
   foo: Fraction Integer -> Boolean
  == add
   foo(x: Integer): Boolean == true
   foo(y: Fraction Integer): Boolean == false
---END bbb.spad

)clear all
)co bbb.spad
(1) -> foo(1$Integer)
    Loading /home/hemmecke/scratch/RHXPKG.NRLIB/code for package RHxPkg

    (1)  true

(2) -> foo(1$Fraction(Integer))

    (2)  false

So, that is an instance of where the interpreter give different results 
than the code that SPAD compiles.
(BTW, is it possible to do without wrapping the functions by a package 
in the SPAD code?)

I never want it built-in. Only the interpreter could be allowed (as it 
is now) to apply certain coercions.

Interesting that some mathematicians think that 0 is a natural number 
and some don't. But maybe you apply an indeterministic interpretation 
function. ;-)

Hopefully, the programmer who implemented Fraction knew that.

It is not the same logic. The / in the middle of (2/1)/(3/1) is a 
different function from the other two /. I am sure you have heard of

OK. We disagree.

If the system knew that Fraction were idempotent, then no problem. But 
see the code in RHXPKG2. Fraction in the Axiom library code is not 
idempotent.

Are we discussing system matters or personal issues?

So, just to confirm: if you follow all 10 of Martin's steps starting
with patch-49 do you obtain a working version of Axiom including
Hyperdoc and graphics?

If so, I guess we had better worry about what else might be wrong in
patch-50. Since AXIOMsys works in patch-50 (so far as we know) but
hyperdoc and graphics both fail, that should be a clue but the
interaction with Martin's modified build procedure is still entirely
unclear to me.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I disagree with the term "programming variable" and also that
SPAD and Aldor do not understand this. And I now also disagree
with my tentative conclusion above: 'a1' is *not* a very good
model for an indefinite integer.

What I get is "memory may be damaged". This is quite understandable
since k is local to the function and you are trying to use it
as part of an Expression that is returned to the main line. Try this
instead:

(1) -> k: POLY(Integer)
       Type: Void
(2) -> foo(n: Integer): POLY Integer == (n*k)
   Function declaration foo : Integer -> Polynomial Integer has been
      added to workspace.

You are right, most of the rest of what I wrote in that email
is wrong. :(

I think the only thing I can salvage from my thoughts so far in
this thread is that in Axiom "indefinite integers" need to be
members of some domain and that domain is not so different from
'Polynomial Integer' but there needs to be some more specific
structure.

Right now I am thinking:

(1) -> a:MPOLY([a],INT)

looks like the kind of universal algebra that you describe above.
Clear MPOLY([a],INT) is a superset of INT and +$MPOLY([a],INT)
extends +$INT in an appropriate way.

Consider:

(2) -> a1:MPOLY([a1,a2],INT)
       Type: Void

(3) -> a2:MPOLY([a1,a2],INT)
       Type: Void

for example as a possible representation of such a domain involving
two indefinite integers.

Bill Page.

Yes. I just finished a new trial again with 49 and 50 at the same time.
50 breaks, 49 doesn't. I hope somebody can reproduce this.

Ah, by the way, I've read the paper and did not find it particularly 
useful. What they do is a bit too complicated in my eyes.

It is certainly a wrong design to implement indefinite integers as 
polynomials.

Why?

Suppose you have a nice algebra library and you want the system to 
understand indefinite objects, then you are certainly not going to add 
any function to existing domains or wrap one (and actually ALL) domains 
with a domain constructor "Indefinite". No. It should be completely 
transparent. The goal is to type

n: Integer;

and not

n: Indefinite(Integer);

Either the interpreter or some layer between interpreter and library 
code should take care about indefinite objects.

I very much believe that this requires reflection from SPAD/Aldor.

Complicated? As far as I can see this is about a simple as it could
be.

Although there does appear to be some code missing from the paper.
This code does not compile as it is.

I am not really sure I understand what you mean by "transparent" -
particularly in to the context of SPAD/Aldor. For the most part the
type system of SPAD/ALDOR is not "transparent" by design. One must
specify (almost) all types for these compilers. Unlike Haskell, for
example, type inference in Aldor is very limited.

Polynomials are necessarily involved in the definition of the
LocalAlgebra. Your argument is not an argument against using a
LocalAlgebra as an implementation of indefinite integers.

This could be easily achieved in the Axiom interpreter but I don't
think it makes any sense in the compiler. In the compiler you must
write:

  n: Indefinite(Integer)

(or the equivalent) because of the semantics associated with

  n: Integer

in a static strongly typed language.

Why? I do not see reflection as essential in a statically typed
language.

Hello,

At line 15282 of src/doc/book.pamphlet (page 299 in the produced DVI
file) the polynomial wrote in LaTeX mathematical mode (display) is
enclosed in a verbatim environment. The verbatim environment can be
removed.

Greg

For what I have read, build-improvements will be gone after Gaby's work
is completed and added to Silver -> Gold.

Should I put Silver on the repository?

OK, maybe transparent is a bad word. What I mean was that if I would
like to work with indefinite integers I would not like to write anything
more complicated than "n: Integer". I believe that the type of an
indefinite integer is Integer and NOT Indefinite(Integer). But, of
course that can only work in the interpreter and not in library code (ie
for the compiler).

Here *I* don't understand what you mean by transparent. But it's not
important here.

In terms of readability of the code, I rather like that Aldor forces the 
programmer to add type declarations in function definitions. I agree 
that it is sometimes quite cumbersome, but a bit of redundancy is never 
bad if you read your (own) code in 5 years. We still have no good tool 
that shows the type of identifiers if you hover over it with your mouse.

I'll be quite until I have put my ideas into code. Currently I don't 
think that I would use polynomials. I would rather encode an indefinite 
object by a function similar to typed lambda calculus. An indefinite 
integer is then just an identity function Z->Z (macro Z==Integer) and 
addition would be something like

(a: Z->Z) + (b: Z->Z): (Z,Z)->Z == (x: Z, y: Z): Z +-> a(x) + b(y)

the zero? function would be lifted like

zero?(a: Z->Z): Z->Boolean == (x: Z):Boolean +-> zero?(a(x))

But that is all not very well thought of, since how would I then write 
the equivalent of "zero?(2+3)" if 2 and 3 are replaced by indefinite 
integers? Ah, actually one needs

zero?(a: T->Z): T->Boolean == (t:T): Boolean +-> zero?(a(t))

But how to deal with the type T? I stop here.

Right. But I need a use case that would justify that it is reasonable 
that indefinite integers should appear in library code.

Oh, of course, reflection is not generally necessary. I meant that for 
what I have in mind I probably would need reflection. But maybe not.
Don't take me too serious. All that discussion is just to make the 
concept clearer. Code is still far away, especially a good design for 
indefinite objects.

It wont be gone, it will be merged back into Silver Trunk and
someday merged into Gold (if/when Tim Daly is convinced that this
is the right way to build Axiom).

The terminology is still rather confusing, but from my point
of view the axiom.build-improvements branch is a branch of
Silver. So I guess you are asking whether you should put the
Silver *trunk* branch into the Google Code archive?

I would still prefer that we duplicate the most experiment branch
i.e. build-improvements, at Google. Among other things, it is
currently the branch that best meets Google's requirement that
we not attempt to re-distribute other packages as part of our
source tree. But Silver trunk still has a lot of that dead wood.

Bill Page.

Sorry, I should be more explicit :) . Yes I meant having the Silver
trunk in the Google repository.

After sending the email, I realized that your suggestion for build-improvements
was a better option, and also a smaller one :). I was about to test
something to keep both repositories in sync, but I got a quota error
again. Apparently Google did not increase the size to 200 MB.

Alfredo

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00344.html

The terminology is actually not confusing. The point is that we should 
*not* call the whole SourceForge SVN repository Silver, but only the 
trunk. Otherwise Silver = Sourceforge/Axiom (with now 3 or 4 (different) 
branches of the axiom Sources).

Whatever we put there, we are probably only doing this to be present at 
Google. I guess nobody will seriously use the Google repository until 
build-improvements is merged with Silver.

What I meant was that in spite of the email referenced above, it
is still confusing to *me*. I find it awkward not to be able to
use Silver to refer to other branches in the SourceForge SVN archive.
I know someone suggested that we start to use Bronze etc. but I am
not sure that that would help.

Are you referring to the CVS on SourceForge (presumably identical
to the CVS on Savannah)? I thought these only had a single branch.

If you are talking about the arch (tla) archive on axiom-developer
then, you are right. I was just about to ask whether we should refer
to these a "Gold" or not. There are actually more like 10 of these
branchs and one of them is the axiom--windows--1 branch. That is
the only branch that builds on Windows now. Do we call it Gold?

I hope that is not the case.

Well, this is open source development which mean "release early
and releas often". The more accessible our experimental branchs
are, the more they will be tested and the better our software
will become. Of course people have to be warned about exactly what
they are downloading so that they have the proper expectations
about how it might/might not work. But I think we want to encourage
people to at least try the latest experimental versions. As an
Axiom developer that is the only version I am really interested
in.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Who is using CVS? Cannot we just remove support for CVS? We are 
needlessly investing time in keeping all the different repositories in 
sync (who is actually doing it?) As far as I understand Tim releases 
axiom--main--1-patch-??, calls that Gold and then transfers the code to 
the two CVS repositories on Savannah and SF. So there are 3 ways to get 
GOLD.

No, I would only call axiom--main--1 as Gold. Click on Sources on the 
frontpage. Until now nobody has complained about the page that I have 
created so I think we should stick to it (until somebody is bold). ;-)

 > There are actually more like 10 of these

No. BTW, why cannot axiom--windows--1 be merged with axiom--main--1? Is 
it so different?

>=20

It is different but not too different. There are changes in
some of the Boot and Lisp code because Axiom uses some non-
portable unixism like calling system functions that only
exist on unix. There is also the fact that currently neither
Hyperdoc nor Axiom graphics can be built on Windows because
of the X-windows library dependencies.

But in any case, yes it could and should be merged back into
axiom--main--1. This has been waiting almost two years to
happen. Are you volunteering? :-)

The path that I had in mind to do this is starting with the
build-improvements branch on SVN since the new build environment
is based on tecnhiques that should be portable to the Windows
MSYS/MinGW environment and also can start with a previously
installed version of GCL which simplifies things significantly
on Windows.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I had a bit of trouble with my Windows MSYS/MinGW configuration
over the weekend, but now I have got it straight. See the Windows
configuration here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

for how I setup the build environment.

I needed the following patch to build on Windows because of a
difference with lstat (explained in the patch).

$ diff -Naur gcl-2.6.8pre_orig/o gcl-2.6.8pre/o
diff -Naur gcl-2.6.8pre_orig/o/unixfsys.c gcl-2.6.8pre/o/unixfsys.c

----------

With this patch applied I was able to build both the CLtL1 and ANSI
images.

Here are the results of some tests of the new si:stat function:

>(si:stat "tryserv.xxx")

NIL

>(si:stat "bfd")       =20

(:DIRECTORY 0 1158734019)

>(quit)

------------

The difference between this and your output below seems to be due
to a change in the coding for this section in the current CVS
which now looks like this:

  if (lstat(filename,&ss))
    RETURN1(Cnil);
  else {/* ctime_r insufficiently portable */
    /* int j;
       ctime_r(&ss.st_ctime,filename);
       j=3Dstrlen(filename);
       if (isspace(filename[j-1]))
       filename[j-1]=3D0;*/
    RETURN1(list(3,S_ISDIR(ss.st_mode) ? sKdirectory :
                 (S_ISLNK(ss.st_mode) ? sKlink : sKfile),
                 make_fixnum(ss.st_size),make_fixnum(ss.st_ctime)));

-------

So is this the result you expected from Windows?

Bill Page.

Oh, sorry, me doing the merge connected with Windows is probably not the 
best idea. There should proably be one who is more familiar with Windows.

The last edit on axiom--windows--1 was 2005-03-17. Wouldn't it make 
sense to merge it first with Gold (tla), then test it and only 
afterwards merge with the build-improvements? I guess that Gold is 
closer than build-improvements.

I've just tried

tla get arch@axiom-developer.org--axiom/axiom--windows--1 axiom--windows--1

(one line)

cd axiom--windows--1
tla star-merge arch@axiom-developer.org--axiom/axiom--main--1

Runs nicely, but gives a number of conflicts in the Makefiles which I 
feel unable to resolve. :-(

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

Is there some particular reason why one needs darcs for the Windows 
build? Doesn't one have to get axiom--windows--1 from the tla archive?

I am confused.

There is a tla archive axiom--windows--1 AND a darcs archive 
axiom--windows--1? Unfortunately it is nowhere written that they are in 
sync. The darcs archive doesn't even appear on

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources

so it is non-existing... ;-) ... only for people who want to run MathAction

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MathActionRepository

We simply have two many source archives and potential contributors have 
to ask at the axiom-developer mailing list which one contains the 
blessed sources.

We have discussed this before. The problem is that there is
no reliable version of tla for Windows. Both Mike Thomas and
I have tried several different versions and they all have
problems. As far as I have been able to determine, tla is not
being actively maintained anymore, so the prospects of a good
Windows version seems small.

We started using darcs for axiom--windows--1 because it works
reliably on both Linux and Windows. Of course we probably
also could have used CVS but at the time we were already
moving away from it.

Now we are also using SVN but (possibly because of the
SourceForge problem) I have not been able to do a complete
checkout of anything from the SVN repository to Windows.

As noted on the BuildAxiom page they were in sync as of
March 15, 2005 but the tla archive has not been updated
since March 17, 2005, so I think it is safe to say that they
are not in sync. But they are probably not very different.
I had planned to keep it up to date by manually transferring
the contents from one archive to the other on the axiom-
developer server, but in the end I really did very little
work with Windows after we got the first working executable.

I would be happy if you would correct this. I am not sure of
the best solution. Should we ignore the merging problem and
just call the darcs version the official sources for Windows?

Yes that is a problem. What is your suggested solution?

If someone can prove that SVN actually does work reliably on
Windows, then maybe that would be the best option?

Maybe one day we will be using bazaar-ng since that seems to be actively 
maintained by the ubuntu people.

Clear. We should only use CVS as a way of distributing (if at all), but 
not really working with it. Its days are numbered. ;-)

Have you ever tried

svn co -r1 https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk trunk
cd trunk
svn update

I wouldn't. Better would be to sync them then I can declare on 
AxiomSource that they are the same. And sooner or later they should 
disappear anyway, because they should be merged to Gold or Silver. 
(First, of course, to Silver, but a merge with Gold was easy since we 
have "tla star-merge". The hard part is to sort out the conflicts.

Document on AxiomSources. That should be the place to read about our 
source mess. ;-) If you bring axiom--windows--1 in sync with the tla 
archive, then I add the stuff to AxiomSources. I guess, you volunteer to 
be the maintainer of that branch. I haven't heard from Mike Thomas or 
Tim (who are currently the maintainers of the tla axiom--windows--1). 
Can I make you the maintainer of the darcs and tla versions?

> If someone can prove that SVN actually does work reliably on

Probably, then axiom--windows--1 would exist as a branch on sourceforge.
But to be honest, I would rather try to avoid that and better ask for 
help from developers knowledgeable in Windows to actually do the merge now.

I don't think the additional differences in build-improvements
would make the merging more or less difficult. I would like to
take advantage of the new configure scripts to help detect
the differences between Linux and Windows.

I seriously doubt that star-merge would be of much help in
merging these two sources because they work on two different
systems. The changes on the Linux side might be incompativle
with Windows and vice versa even though there is no conflict
to resolve. So even if star-merge succeeded, it is likely to
cause breakages in both environments.

I think our original process for developing the Windows port
was flawed. We should not really have created a separate
branch just for Windows.

I think we really need to start again with the up to date
Linux sources: (1) Test the build of that source code on
Windows. (2) If the build fails, we can consult the diffs
with the old Windows sources to see if it contains a solution.
(3) after we update the sources then we must first check that
it still builds on Linux. (4) If it does then we can continue
to test on Windows at step (1). And iterate until we have
sources that work on both systems.

There are really not that many changes to the Axiom source
code on Windows. Most of the work done by Mike Thomas involved
patches to GCL to allow it to compile Axiom. And Most of these
have since been incorporated in gcl-2.6.8pre.

gcl-2.6.8pre does compile on Windows with one minor change. But
my first attempt to use it to compile the Axiom windows sources
fails with a data type conflict on MYCOMBINE in src/interp/
cfuns.lisp.pamphlet which is partly coded in C embedded in
Lisp and partly in Lisp.

This seems similar to a problem that Camm solved with using
2.6.8pre on linux.

Bill Page.

Clear. We should only use CVS as a way of distributing (if at all), but 
not really working with it. Its days are numbered. ;-)

Have you ever tried

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00321.html

svn co -r1 https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/trunk trunk
cd trunk
svn update

I wouldn't. Better would be to sync them then I can declare on 
AxiomSource that they are the same. And sooner or later they should 
disappear anyway, because they should be merged to Gold or Silver. 
(First, of course, to Silver, but a merge with Gold was easy since we 
have "tla star-merge". The hard part is to sort out the conflicts.

Document on AxiomSources. That should be the place to read about our 
source mess. ;-) If you bring axiom--windows--1 in sync with the tla 
archive, then I add the stuff to AxiomSources. I guess, you volunteer to 
be the maintainer of that branch. I haven't heard from Mike Thomas or 
Tim (who are currently the maintainers of the tla axiom--windows--1). 
Can I make you the maintainer of the darcs and tla versions?

 > If someone can prove that SVN actually does work reliably on

Probably, then axiom--windows--1 would exist as a branch on sourceforge.
But to be honest, I would rather try to avoid that and better ask for 
help from developers knowledgeable in Windows to actually do the merge now.

Yes. Unfortunately it fails with the same error message as on
Linux:

svn: REPORT request failed on '/svnroot/axiom/!svn/vcc/default'
svn: REPORT of '/svnroot/axiom/!svn/vcc/default': Could not read
response body:

Merging is awkward so long as we use too different archive systems.
It means the merge has to be done on a combination of different
machines.

Maybe moving the SVN archive to axiom-developer.org will help.

I am still tempted to look for solutions outside of all of the
archive systems we have tries so far. The more I read about
Mercurial the more I like it...

Regards,
Bill Page.

Some good news. With the patches supplied by Camm in:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00344.ht
ml

and removing the out-of-date patches which have since been
incorporated into gcl, the darcs axiom--windows--1 source code
seems to be compiling using the new gcl-2.6.8pre. I now expect it
to complete successfully (I will confirm in a couple of hours).

This means that at least we will be able to work with the same
version of gcl in both Linux and Windows once Camm officially
releases 2.6.8. The Windows version of Axiom was last successfully
compiled only with a patched version of gcl-2.6.5.

Bill Page.

Does that happen already at "svn co -r1"?

And http://gallery.menalto.com/node/53820 also did not help?

Same error here. It happens when you do the update.

No. The failure occurs during the the 'svn update' step. Or
during the 'svn co' step if I omit the -r1.

I tried this on Linux and it did not help. On Windows I do not
know how to find the .subversion directory.

On Windows I am using the following subversion version:

$ svn --version
svn, version 1.4.0 (r21228)
   compiled Sep 11 2006, 17:46:59

Copyright (C) 2000-2006 CollabNet.

This product includes software developed by CollabNet
(http://www.Collab.Net/).

The following repository access (RA) modules are available:

* ra_dav : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV (DeltaV)
protocol.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network
protocol.
  - handles 'svn' scheme
* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.

Have you read http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html?

Especially,

Why do I get occasional, seemingly inconsistent errors checking out over 
http:// from a repository running on MacOS X 10.4 (Tiger)?

The answer claims that it is a bug in Apache.

So maybe the sourceforge people should do something...
And Bill maybe you should be careful when setting up apache for SVN on 
axiom-developer.org.

I found it under \Documents and Settings\"local user"\Application

directory, however this didn't fix the problem.

There is not a lot of differences between the two repositories as Bill
said. The file src/doc/ps/segbind.ps is only available in the tla
repository and in the file src/scripts/document the latex variable is
defined differently: `which latex` in the tla repository and latex in
the darcs one. It's on my TODO list to update my Windows version (the
tla one) up to Gold patch-50 but I first need to know why the bug #312
is specific to Axiom on Linux (see

As far as I can tell this file is garbage that happened to get
caught in the archive. It is probably manually saved from the
graphic produced by the draw command in the file
'src/input/segbind.input'. It is not referenced anywhere in
the source.

This is a change I made just last night while testing the windows
build... I guess I might as well explain it here. :) It turns out
that this is just a silly way to refer an executable file. It
breaks if the path to the executable contains directory names
with spaces - something that is quite frequent on Windows. The
new version of MikTeX puts the 'latex.exe' file in the
"c:/Program Files/MikTeX" directory and this causes a failure
in the 'document' script. By just writing 'latex' instead of
`which latex` we let the system lookup the executable in the
normal manner.

What version of tla do you use on Windows? Does it work
reliably for you? Have you tried to delete a tla archive from
Windows yet? With the version of tla what I was using this
is extremely awkward because very long file names prevent
the usual method of deleteing directories from working.

If you have patience, perhaps you could try a binary search
through the older linux versions to find where the failure
was introduced. The axiom--windows--1 branch was cloned from
the linux version at about patch-30, I think. You can retrieve
the older patch versions from the tla archive by appending the
patch suffix to the archive name, like this:

  $ tla get axiom--main--1-patch-50 axiom-50
  $ tla get axiom--main--1-patch-49 axiom-49
  ...

Bill Page.

OK, I understand now, I checked out axiom--windows--1 with darcs today
since it can be considered as the official branch for you. Personally, I
never install "Unix world" softwares (Axiom, Cygwin, MinGW, MikTeX,
Perl, Python etc...) in a path with spaces.

No, I tried in the past without success. I've never tested darcs on
Windows. I thought that the official branch was on the tla repository
so I downloaded it from Linux.

OK, thanks. I don't know how I will do. I diff-ed some weeks ago the
int/algebra/*.spad (between patch-(49 or 50) and the windows branch) and
tested individually each modified file without success. So it seems to
me that the bug was introduced in the interpreter or somewhere else but
not in the algebra files. I could be wrong though.

This idea came out of some IRC discussions between myself and Kai a
little while back, and I thought we might as well bring it to the list.
 One of the drawbacks to the current Axiom codebase is that while the
existing pamphlets can indeed be processed by noweave and notangle,
they are not literate in the sense of having code chunks and
documentation woven together and being reorganized for human
consumption.  (At least, most of them - there are a few exceptions.)

While many of us lack the technical skills to be able to decode the
actual source code and document what it does, an alternative which can
still be useful is to take the mostly monolithic code chunks in the
existing pamphlet files and break them down into something more
managable.  Even if for the most part the people doing this can't add
useful comments, they can introduce a more literate program like
structure to the file and clear the way for more skilled programmers
who will deal with these files in the future.

The approach is simple - select one pamphlet file, and re-configure the
<*> chunk (usually the only chunk in a file aside from the license)
into more discrete components as per dhmatrix and other such files.  Of
course the breakdown made might be something other than the final,
optimal structure used during documentation but it should at least help
start the process.  If the person surveying the file has some idea as
to the functionality of some parts they can go ahead and introduce
documentation, but that is not essential - the idea is to make use of
anyone who might be less skilled at reading old lisp and boot code but
would still like to further the progress of Axiom.  Hence the name
Axiom Survey - it is not intended to be an in-depth exploration and
comprehension of the source code, just a first pass that helps those
who will follow.

As a more or less arbitrary starting point, we picked the
i-*.boot.pamphlet files in the interp directory.  I've broken down a
few of them into smaller chunks, although I haven't really added much
in the way of documentation as yet.  I created diff -Naur patches, but
it's almost needless since the only change is the literate structure
and there is no logic change to be explained.  They seem to build OK so
I'm hoping that means I didn't let any code slip through the cracks.

Does this sound like a useful project to put in motion?  With luck it
will be an aid to those who are skilled enough to understand the code,
and at the same time it will help introduce people to the Axiom
codebase.

Cheers,
CY

Here's a proposal

Is is possible to create a domain which stores numbers so 
they always have an exact representation that terminates?

Clearly we can do this with FRAC(INT) so that 1/3 is
an exact representation of .333...

But the question is, can we create a domain that will
store the number in the lowest base which holds an exact
representation, such as 121 base 3? Something other than
base 2 or base 10?

It seems to me that some of the issues of floating-point
computation may be handled by dynamically changing the
base so the representation can handle intermediate
results exactly.

Comments?

(I'm on the road until monday evening so email access
is extremely questionable)

No it is not. At least not until you reveal what you understand by a 
"number" and what properties it should have.

BTW, how would you store \pi in a finite way? Is it 1 in base \pi?

Tim,

It is well known that in general real numbers do not have
any exact representation that "terminates" in this sense.
But not everything we do in a computer must be represented
in this way. For example in Axiom we can easily manipultate
series, continuing fractions, and other sorts of "stream-like"
object that are (potentially) infinite in size but which have
finite descriptions.

See http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RealNumbers

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Tim,

a very cute question indeed. The approach proposed by Bill Page is quite
interesting in that way, that the completition of a number field can be
done in different ways using ideas from topos theory. I don't even see how
to manage the wealth of possibilities here. However what about truncating
computations in a sort of p-adic way along with a stream like
reprsentations?

To pick up Ralf Hemmeke's example, if you want to represent pi, you might
want it to expand in powers of some prime number, eg 3

pi= a1*3^1+a0*3^0+ .....

a stram like object could represent the n-th power truncated version of
such expansions. The inductive limit of these objects would actually (but
infinitely) represent the number.

Over all it seems to be very complicated and I would not expect such a
representation to be helpful for numeric calculations (speedwise) at all.

ciao
BF.

Dear all, especially Alfredo and Bill!

First of all, I would like to say a big THANK YOU! for your encouragement and
your energy, although it has not quite worked out.

However: If you would save the image somewhere so I can download it, I could
burn a couple of CD's tonight.

I must confirm that I was also using patch 49. I didn't think of that
possibility. I'm truly sorry - please excuse.

On the other hand, I can report that my presentation (even though only a
poster) was quite a success. Although people are very sceptical about Axiom, I
was able to demonstrate that my algorithms are faster by an exponential
facter. (I.e., I need linear time, GFUN get's stack after something like a 100
terms.)

I'll report more when the conference is over, and I'll add some documentation,
too.

Antoine: could you make your univariate holonomic package available? That would
be splendid.

Thanks again,

Martin

Hi,

is it possible with axiom to say "draw(...)" and then save the generated 
picture as a .ps file or a .png without manual interaction? I basically 
want

   echo "draw(...)" | axiom > picture.ps

The reason is that in book.pamphlet there appear via

\spadcommand{draw(...)}

the commands that produce the pictures given in the book. With a little 
rewriting that could be automated and these .ps files in src/doc/ps 
could go away. Note that we should then also be able to produce higher 
resulution pictures (if Axiom allows it).

Yes, all you need is to be using a machine that has X11
installed. his is possible even on a machine that doesn't
have a graphics adapter (such as the axiom-developer.org
server) by using a virtual frame buffer driver.

See "Extensions to MathAction" at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SummerOfCode#msg20050602105831-0500@page.=
axiom-developer.org

And these related pages:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxXvfbRun

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomGraphics

I have tried this while connected via ssh to axiom-developer
server and I am able to create a postscript graphic which
I can then download. My intention is to use this technique
to add Axiom graphics to the wiki pages.

I have verified that I can run the 'axiom -gr -noht' script
inside a Xvfb shell and create postscript files in this way,
but there is a complication due to the interaction between
sman and AXIOMsys that prevent the usual method of communication
via unix pipes from working. The solution is to use the lower
level pty interface to send commands and receive output from
'axiom -gr -noht'. I learned how to do this properly in Python
using a package called 'Pexpect' from reading the code that
does this in Sage. But I haven't had enough extra time available
to contine work on this.

Regards,
Bill Page.

For a practical implementation see the RealLib Project:

http://www.brics.dk/~barnie/RealLib

by Branimir Lambov

http://www.brics.dk/~barnie/

and especially his paper:

A two-layer approach to the computability and complexity of
real functions

http://www.brics.dk/~barnie/RealPaper.pdf

The Sage developers are working on an interface to RealLib

http://sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org/RealLib3
http://sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org/DidierDeshommes
http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/packages/optional

I would like to be able to do this in Axiom.

Thank you, Bill. I really thought that it would have been easier.

Does somebody know why X11 is required? Axiom was also sold on Windows 
if I am not completely wrong. How did NAG produce graphics there?

I quickly looked at src/algebra/view2D.spad but I could not see anything 
related to X. Since I have no idea what

   VIEW    ==> VIEWPORTSERVER$Lisp

refers to, I am out of business. :-( But I really really wonder, why X 
is a must for draw and/or write. Does Axiom (through LISP) call some 
functions from X?

Ciao
Ralf

There is no X11 code in Axiom proper. Axiom only sends the plot data
to Viewman (see the src/graph subdirectory) or one of his friends (I
don't remember the details). They create the graphics and the ability
to dump PS files. Needless to say, they need X11.

Interesting places to look at are (all under $AXIOM/SRC):

GRAPH/*, INTERP/SOCKIO.LISP.PAMPHLET and ALGEBRA/VIEW*.SPAD.PAMPHLET.


To address your problem: I seem to remember that there is a simple way
to print the plot data (i.e. the list of points) to the console. If
not, simply change VIEW2D.SPAD. Then feed that list to GnuPlot.

I attached UIDRAW.SPAD.PAMPHLET, which is a modified VIEW2D.SPAD
(iirc). I used it to generate plot data for my SOC project. I'm sure
you could do a better job, but it worked for me. It prints the data as
Lisp sexps, though. You should probably change that. You also need
*PRINT-ARRAY* to be T.

Yes of course. There has been a long ongoing discussion about
how best to implement Hyperdoc and Axiom Graphics on Windows
because of this issue. X11 is required because both HyperDoc
and Axiom Graphics call X11 library functions directly when
creating windows and drawing to the screen.

> Axiom was also sold on Windows if I am not completely wrong.

You are correct.

> How did NAG produce graphics there?

NAG integrated two new packages for Axiom on Windows - one
called OpenInventor (for graphics) and the other Techexplorer
(a latex-cable browser to replace Hyperdoc). Both of these
packages were proprietary at the time Axiom was made open
source but now they are (more or less) open.

OpenInventor is now called 'Coin3d'. See:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00201.htm=
l

and the related threads:

This is part of the communications interface between Axiom and
Axiom Graphics. Axiom Graphics is a separate program written in
"C" that does all of the interaction with X11. AXIOMsys (which
is the program that runs the code at which you are looking) sends
commands to Axiom Graphics via a session socket.

>=20

No, not directly. Only by sending a command to another process
that does that work.

Bill Page.

Hi,

I've 'literated' VMLISP.LISP.PAMPHLET (the result is attached), which
contains compatibility/utility code. In particular, I did the
following:

1) I gave most functions their own chunk. Sometimes I put several
   functions in a single chunk, mostly because they didn't need
   individual documentation. For example there are a lot of aliases. I
   put most of them in a single chunk.

2) I added/removed blank lines and comments. The latter only if they
   appeared to be useless. Otherwise I just kept them.

3) I *did not* change the capitalization/formatting of code. At least
   not intentionally.

4) I *did* change the order of function definitions. This was
   necessary since I put several functions within a single chunk.

5) I *did not* delete any code that wasn't commented out.

6) I created sections roughly corresponding to the comments in
   VMLISP.LISP, which in turn corresponded to the VMLISP Manual. I
   added sections, when it seemed appropriate. I also moved code
   between sections, because sometimes functions were in the wrong
   sections.

   Almost every section contains at least one sentence describing
   what's supposed to go in there. Of course, that's not final.

   There are still functions in the wrong section, since the section
   scheme changed a few times.

7) I wrote documentation for some of the functions. There is still a
   lot of work to do, but it's a start.

8) I built Axiom using the new version. The build didn't finish, but
   it failed in the same spot as with the old one (algebra: compiling
   ahyp.spad). Cliff (CY) apparently succeeded building Axiom with the
   new file.


While literating VMLISP.LISP.PAMPHLET, I maintained a list with open questions,
suggestions, comments etc. Here it is:


1) Credits. There are a few places where credit is given to the
    contributor of a function (search for Juergen Weiss in
    VMLISP.LISP, for example). While I agree that giving proper credit
    to contributors is important, I don't think that the documentation
    chunks of individual functions are the right place. Currently
    that's not a problem since there is almost no documentation, but
    hopefully that will change. I'm not sure how to handle credits
    properly, though. Therefore I did not remove the credits given to
    Juergen in VMLISP.LISP so far.

2) Fixes and history. Some existing chunks are marked as fixes for
   specific compiler versions or contain a complete history for a tiny
   snippet of code. I believe that history belongs in the SVN/Arch/etc
   comments and fixes shouldn't be there at all. If there's a bug in
   the compiler, the compiler should be fixed. If a work-around is
   needed until the bug is removed, the fix should go as soon as the
   bug is fixed; or at least not stay indefinitely.

   For example, take a look at VMLISP.LISP:

     In GCL 2.5 there is a bug in the write-to-string function.
     It should respect *print-escape* but it does not. That is,

     ...

     <<stringimage fix>>=
     ;(define-function 'prin2cvec #'write-to-string)
     (define-function 'prin2cvec #'princ-to-string)
     ;(define-function 'stringimage #'write-to-string)
     (define-function 'stringimage #'princ-to-string)
     @

   Since we don't use GCL 2.5 anymore, why do we keep this? The
   work-around isn't bad since it doesn't really matter wether we call
   WRITE-TO-STRING with *PRINT-ESCAPE* bound to NIL or PRINC-TO-STRING
   (although the latter also binds *PRINT-READABLY* to NIL). But why
   do we keep the explanation of the problem around?

3) Obsolete code/documentation. There is a lot of code that is
   obsolete or almost obsolete. Either because it isn't used anywhere
   or because it is for the benefit of a long dead Lisp system (see
   point 4 below; also look at the 'No-ops and Constant Functions' and
   'Obsolete Functions' in VMLISP.LISP.PAMPHLET)

4) Obsolete and other *FEATURES*:
   
   - CCL (Codemist is dead/obsolete and CCL is also used by OpenMCL)
   - Lucid (dead/obsolete)
   - IBCL (dead/obsolete)
   - KCL (should be replaced with GCL)
   - CMULISP (obsolete; CMU CL does not have this in *FEATURES*)
   - ALLEGRO (is that code for Franz's Allegro CL? Does it run?)
   - ibm/370 (obsolete)
   - LispM (obsolete :-( )
   - AKCL (should be GCL)
   - RIOS (obsolete)
   - DOS (obsolete)
   - RT ?
   - oldboot ?
   - symbolics (obsolete)
   - ibmps2 (obsolete)
   - mcl (is that for Digitool's MCL or for OpenMCL?)
   - lispworks (Is that a recent addition? Does it work?)
   - cormanlisp (see lispworks)
   - clisp (see lispworks)
   - sbcl (see lispworks)
   - abcl (see lispworks)

   Conditionalized code shouldn't be sprinkled all over the place.

5) INT-CHAR isn't part of CL (see A.1.3 of the Hyperspec). Since it
   seems to work like CODE-CHAR, we should probably replace the former
   by the latter.  It is only used in two places, one of which is the
   awkwardly named EBCDIC, which isn't used very often either.

6) I'm not sure what to make of

     (defun copy (x) (copy-tree x)) ; not right since should descend vectors

   Since Axiom runs very nicely without COPY descending vectors, isn't
   that comment obsolete? How did it get there in the first place? And
   why not simply use copy-tree directly then?

7) What about the following:

     ; The following version has been provided to avoid reliance on the
     ; Common Lisp concatenate and replace functions. These built-in
     ; Lisp functions would probably end up doing the
     ; character-by-character copying shown here, but would also need to
     ; cope with generic sorts of sequences and unwarranted keyword
     ; generality

     (defun rplacstr (cvec1 start1 length1 cvec2
                            &optional start2 length2
                            &aux end1 end2)

   Is CONCATENATE really that slow? Is it still bad to depend on its
   existence?

8) What about functions/macros that have unused parameters or provide
   functionality that is somewhat esoteric and isn't used anywhere?
   For example:

     (defun MAKE-OUTSTREAM (filespec &optional (width nil) (recnum 0))
       (declare (ignore width) (ignore recnum))
         (cond ((numberp filespec) (make-synonym-stream '*terminal-io*))
           ((null filespec) (error "not handled yet"))
           (t (open (make-filename filespec) :direction :output))))

   This function is at least once called with optional arguments, but
   obviously that doesn't change anything. The method of creating a
   SYNONYM-STREAM of *TERMINAL-IO*, if passed a number, seems pretty
   insane (even though I can see where that's coming from). The same
   holds for that (NULL FILESPEC) clause.

9) There are many functions with suboptimal names. Examples:

   gensymp - checks wether its argument is an uninterned symbol

   fixp - checks for INTEGER instead of FIXNUM, unless you're running
          CCL

   LC2UC - also called UCASE and UPCASE. The latter is related to CL's
           STRING-UPCASE, but does fancy things for symbols and lists,
           and lets other atoms pass through. There should be only one
           name for this, and it shouldn't be LC2UC.

   |camlCaseName| - camel case is frowned upon in Lisp. Having to type
                    vertical bars twice for a name is awful. I
                    understand that this might be useful/necessary for
                    BOOT code, but eventually these should be changed.

   ALLCAPS - Nowadays the consensus seems to be that lowercase names
             are better. I think we should stick to that. Since the
             Lisp reader upcases everything anyway (unless it's
             surrounded by vertical bars, see above) it doesn't change
             anything.

   is-foo - ANSI CL uses a -p suffix for predicates, as in NUMBERP or
            DIGIT-CHAR-P. I believe we should stick to this. If not,
            we should at least establish a new convention. Currently
            several conventions are used (all from VMLISP.LISP):

              IS-CONSOLE
              PLACEP
              ZERO?

            I understand that even CL makes a few exceptions, but that
            doesn't imply that we have make a mess as well.

   com,mas - This is a matter of style but commas in identifiers are
             just ugly. They don't serve a purpose either.

   nohyphens - Example:

                 LISTOFFREES

               should be

                 LIST-OF-FREES

               In fact, it should be

                 list-of-frees

10) Functions as macros. There are quite a few macros that could be
   functions. They are usually made macros for performance reasons (to
   inline code). This is bad style, crippels the 'functions' and makes
   debugging hard. One could probably get the same or similar
   performance with appropriate inline declarations. Example:

     (defmacro identp (x)
       (if (atom x)
         `(and ,x (symbolp ,x))
         (let ((xx (gensym)))
           `(let ((,xx ,x))
              (and ,xx (symbolp ,xx))))))

     should be

     (declare (inline identp))
     (defun identp (x)
       (and x (symbolp x)))

   There are many similar cases (ifcar, ifcdr, eqcar, ...).

11) EVAL-WHEN. The arguments LOAD, COMPILE and EVAL are
    deprecated. They have been superseded by :LOAD-TOPLEVEL,
    :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL and :EXECUTE.

12) Packages. It is usually recommended that there is exactly one
    IN-PACKAGE form per file to avoid confusion. Since apparently the
    idea is to stuff the whole interpreter into a single pamphlet
    (exposing the hideousness of LP) I'm not sure how this
    translates.

    Usually it is also recommended to bundle functionality in
    packages. Currently that isn't done at all. There are only very
    few packages, and some of them don't serve any purpose. Again I'm
    not sure how packages work with LP.

13) (Quasi-)Aliases. There are many functions that are simply aliases
    for others. Some of them are simply created using

      (defun alias-for-foo (arg1 ... argN)
        (foo arg1 ... argN))

    Others are created using

      (define-function alias-for-foo #'foo)

    which simply sets the SYMBOL-FUNCTION of ALIAS-FOR-FOO to the
    function #'FOO.

    Sometimes these aliases don't accept all the parameters that the
    original accepted.

    Quasi-aliases are functions like

      (defun MSUBST (new old tree) (subst new old tree :test #'equal))

    that differ from their original by supplying one or more
    arguments.

    (Quasi-)Aliases should probably be replaced, unless they capture a
    concept. Suppose you store objects of type FOO as lists, and it so
    happens that two FOOs, say FOO-1 and FOO-2, are equal iff

      (equal foo-1 foo-2)

    returns T. In that case it's justified to have a function

      (equal-foo (&rest args)
        (apply #'equal args))

    Also if a (quasi-) alias captures a very common use of the underlying
    function and improves readability it can stay.

    I don't think saving key strokes is enough reason for introducing
    an alias. After all Emacs supports dynamic completion (even in
    Fundamental Mode). Other editors have similar features, I believe.

14) No-ops and constant functions. Believe it or not, but there are
    quite a few functions that literally do nothing, like

      (defun make-string (a) a)

    or

      (defmacro assemble (&rest ignore) 
        (declare (ignore ignore))
        nil)

    I reckon they should go.

16) Multiple definitions. There are multiple definitions for some
    functions, eg (in VMLISP.LISP)

    ;;--------------------> NEW DEFINITION (see unlisp.lisp.pamphlet)
    (defun |ListMember?| (ob l)
      (member ob l :test #'equal) )

    which corresponds to

    ;;--------------------> NEW DEFINITION (override in vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet)
    (defun |ListMemberQ?| (ob l)
      (member ob l :test #'eq) )

    (defun |ListMember?| (ob l)
      (member ob l :test #'equal) )

    in UNLISP.LISP. There is no ListMemberQ? in vmlisp.lisp by the
    way.

    To me it's not clear which of the two definitions is in
    effect. I'd have to look into the appropriate Makefile, I
    guess. Why not just get rid of the obsolete definition?

    This case is particularly interesting, as both definition are
    equivalent.

18) Gensyms. In macros you use GENSYM to generate unique symbols to
    avoid name clashes with user defined symbols. This shouldn't be
    done by hand, though. Instead a macro like WITH-UNIQUE-NAMES or
    WITH-GENSYMS ought to be used.

Here is Kai's revision as a pamphlet file on the Axiom Wiki:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/interp/VmlispLisp

The think the result is quite beautiful.

I just clicked edit and cut-and-pasted Kai's draft into the source
for this page.

After review this and test that it still compiles, I think it should
become parge of the main Axiom distribution. Personally, I much prefer
this approach rather than the single-file monolithic "book volume"
approach that Tim Daly has proposed.

Thank you, Kai!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Gaby,

I am having a terrible time trying to install both subversion as
a server and svk on the axiom-developer.org server.

Both the problem (and the advantage) of subversion as a server
is that it integrates closely with Apache. The version of
Apache that we are running on axiom-developer is too old and
in any case would need to be re-compiled with different options
to use the mod_dav_svn module. So before I can get that working
I have to first have to re-build Apache from source. Getting
this right and converting our httpd.conf configuration to the
new version of Apache is going to take me a few more days. :-(

In the mean time I have also been trying to install svk on this
server because in principle it can be used to help with mirroring
svn branches on other systems and provides additional features
such as star-merge etc.

But even this installation is turning out to be very difficult!
:-( As we discussed during the Skype meeting on Monday, in order
to get svk running I have been struggling with the prerequisite
svn secondary installation procedures that involves some serious
Perl dependencies, svn::core etc. I thought I (finally) had all
that figured out, but now I get the following error when trying
to start svk:

[page@axiom-developer page]$ svk
Can't locate Class/Autouse.pm in @INC (@INC contains:

-------

Perhaps you or someone else who is more familiar with the advanced
use of Perl than I am could suggest where to go from here?

<frustration>
  Man! You sure can tell that subversion was designed by people
  who liked cvs ... ;)
</frustration>

Bill Page.

The Class::Autouse module is missing. See 
http://search.cpan.org/~adamk/Class-Autouse-1.27/. If there is no package
for your distribution (it is named libclass-autouse-perl in Debian),
you can build, test and install the module with:
perl Makefile.pl
make
make test
make install

Ho, I was totally wrong this week-end when I spoke about some socket
related code not used. I reread the sockio.lisp.pamphlet file and found
the functions used in the interpreter (I have never studied these parts
of the intergreter). Sorry for this.

Awesome! I quickly read your file and you have used
\subsection{The arc cotangent function} for cot and asec too :-)

Many thanks for Axiom.

I have committed the build-improvements branch to the trunk
of the Google Repository: http://axiom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

One can checkout the source by doing:
svn checkout http://axiom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ axiom

Can you please add something in the page: http://code.google.com/p/axiom/
explaining like you did in your comment above that this repository is
an experimental version.

Regards,

Alfredo

Kai,

I don't much understand lisp, but what you did in literating the code is 
just super.

For a first approximation that is OK, but I don't believe that the chunk 
names should agree with the names of the functions. If literate 
programming is done in that way, it doesn't add any value.

Not only the documentation around the function should describe the idea 
behind the code also the chunk names should should tell what the code is 
used for. So you would have

<<compute a Groebner basis>>=
<<initialize basis and critical pairs>>
while not empty criticalPairs repeat {
     <<take a critical pair>>
     <<compute the S-polynomial>>
     h := <<reduce the S-polynomial with respect to current basis>>
     if not zero? h then {
         <<update basis and critical pairs>>
     }
}
@

That's the essence of the GB-algorithm. And literate programs should 
convey this essence.

I admid that for LISP it's proably harder to put it into that style, but 
I guess, we are all learning what exactly LP is while we make 
experiences with real code.

I think since you are not deleting or modifying code, you should just 
check, whether the notangled .lisp file is identical to the one from the 
monolithic chunk. It should be no problem to achive this. Then you are 
sure that the compilation will run through.

Good luck for all your work to come. Axiom will benefit from it.
Acually we need more people like Kai.

Ciao
Ralf

Thanks for your help.

This CPAN stuff is pretty scary! :-) I must have just downloaded
and installed several hundred new Perl packages in the list 5
minutes!

I logged in as root and did

  # cpan
  cpan> install Class::Autouse
  cpan> exit

I seemed to install ok. It told me I should upgrade my cpan
installation by 'install Bundle::CPAN' and then reload, which
I did apparently successfully

Then I went to svk and now it gaves me a different error:

[page@axiom-developer page]$ svk

Thanks for pointing that out, but it's not my fault. Those section
headings were there before. I only changed them from \section to
\subsection. It's fixed now.

Most of the functions in VMLISP.LISP.PAMPHLET are really short and
it's hard to see how they could benefit from splitting them up
further. Sometimes functions don't really need individual
documentation, eg. aliases, and it makes sense to stick them
together.

There are a few fairly long and complicated functions, and those
should probably be split up into multiple chunks. Unfortunately, I
have no idea what they do. They are not documented at all and they are
written in a peculiar style.

Sure. If only I knew what the code does.

Actually there is a Lisp specific problem here. Often Lisp code
doesn't rely as much on side effects. Also every Lisp statement is an
expression with a value, which is used a lot. Finally people tend to
use lots of small functions. What is the difference between

(defun bar (...)
  (blah blub))

(defun foo (...)
  (let ((...))
    (bar ...)))

and

<<foo>>=
(defun foo (...)
  (let ((...))
    <<do-bar>>))
@

<<do-bar>>=
(blah blub)

I couldn't, since I reordered code. There's not really a good way
around that, I believe.

Great!

Thanks for doing this. I don't mean to be picky, but I wonder if there
is some way we could just populate /branches and leave /trunk empty?
By calling build-improvements /trunk I am afraid we might cause some
confusion. On the other hand, if Goggle gives us enough space it
would be good to have both /trunk and our current favorite /branch.

How's this? http://code.google.com/p/axiom

One thing about this, is that we cannot edit the page:

http://code.google.com/p/axiom/source

which tells the users how to checkout the source, and it says to do it from the
trunk. I guess if we assume that people will be curious enough, they will look
into the branches, but I am not sure this will be always the case.

With the space we have now, one thing we can do is have Silver in the trunk and
build-improvements in a branch and go from there if Google increases the size.
Do you think that is ok?

Thank you, it looks very good.

Alfredo

When I try this anonymous checkout I get:

$ svn checkout http://axiom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ axiom

it fails immediately with:

  svn: PROPFIND request failed on '/svn/trunk'
  svn: PROPFIND of '/svn/trunk': Could not read status line:
  An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
    (http://axiom.googlecode.com)

----------

It seems like subversion just does like me. :-(

A self checkout (with password):

$ svn checkout https://axiom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ axiom
    --username synthesis.anikast.ca

but it justed failed a long way through the transfer with the
message:

...
A    axiom.build-improvements\src\hyper\pages\GBF.ht
A    axiom.build-improvements\src\hyper\pages\HTXFormatPage5.ht
svn: In directory 'axiom.build-improvements\src\hyper\pages'
svn: Can't copy

y.pht.svn-base' to
'axiom.build-improvements\src\hyper\pages\.svn\tmp\poly.pht.t
mp.tmp': The system cannot find the file specified.

-------

So it's true. Subversion does like me...

BTW, what release of the SourceForge repository is this?
I notice that

 A    axiom.build-improvements\zips\tla-1.1.tar.gz

is still in this archive, but I am quite sure Gaby deleted it last
night. Which raises the question of how to keep this version up to
date with the SourceForge version.

I have been working with a program called 'tailor' on
axiom-developer.org

http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/Tailor

http://fiatdev.com/articles/2006/09/10/mirroring-subversion-with-darcs-a
nd-tailor

This program can transfer as both source and as target systems
to and from: Darcs Subversion Monotone CVS Bazaar-NG Mercurial
and Git (Cogito) and also from Bazaar (Arch 1.x) and Tla (Arch)
source system only.

It seems to work nicely and automatically to create a new archives
and to keep to keep them up to date by automatically running
periodically.

So far I have mirrored the build-improvements branch successfully
with both Mercurial and Darcs. If you are interested ing trying
Mercurial here is the url:

http://mercurial.axiom-developer.org

For more information about Mercurial see

http://www.selenic.com/mercurial

It seems to be just as "fast and easy" as advertised and I can
use it successfully on both Linux and Windows. Installation
was a piece-of-cake (here that subversion developers! ;)

This failure occured on subversion 1.4 on Windows - but I am
behind a strict firewall and proxy. It is possible that webdav
is not fully supported here. I will try later with a linux boxen.

While pulling my hair out about subversion last night, I did
management to find out something very useful, I think.

It is possible to use rsync to make a direct backup of our
subversion archive at SourceForge using the following commands:

  $ export RSYNC_PROXY=3Drsync-svn.sourceforge.net:80
  $ mkdir -p ~/repo/axiom/branches
  $ rsync -v -a rsync-svn-a::svn/axiom/* ~/repo/axiom/branches

See:

http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=3D31070&group_id=3D1#=
bac
kup

Then you can checkout a copy of the souces directly from this
local mirror!

  $ cd ~
  $ pwd
  /home/page
  $ svn info file:///home/page/repo/axiom/branches
  $ svn co file:///home/page/repo/axiom/branches build.improvements

It's fast! because rsync uses a very efficient network protocol
and file:// access is just local.

Please give it a try and let me know if it works for you.=20

Regards,
Bill Page.

You are not alone with this problem, and it is not a bug, I believe, in this
module.
Search with Google "Malformed UTF-8 character (unexpected non-continuation
byte".
Some persons change the read/write mode of the filehandle to the binary one
(with binmode), some others prepend a LANG=C to the command line.
Or maybe modifying the open call with a "<:byte" or a "<:utf8" could help
(see perldoc PerlIO). But this requires to modify this module,
it's not a good solution. Is there some Perl gurus here?

What do you mean you "reordered code"?

If it was

%FILE 1
<<*>>=
blih
blah
bluh
@
%END FILE1

and then you have

%FILE2
<<chunk bluh>>=
bluh
@

<<chunk blih>>=
blih
@

<<*>>=
<<chunk blih>>
<<chunk blah>>
<<chunk bluh>>
@

<<chunk blah>>
blah
@
%END FILE2

notangle FILE1 > file1
notangle FILE2 > file2
cmp file1 file2

should show that the two files are equal.

So what is "reorder"?

I just did:

  $ LANG=3DC perl -MCPAN -e 'install File::Type'

and the install worked fine.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Now I finally have a working

  $ svk version
  This is svk, version 1.08.

I think you are well qualified for that job. :-)

Bill Page.

But the execution... 
A "LANG=C svk ..." will be necessary I think.

Well it wasn't quite that easy, but I did finally get a successful
Windows build of Axiom using gcl-2.6.8pre (as patched for the
previously mentioned lstat problem) but it turned out I needed
a few more patches.

The most serious and difficult problem occurred in Axiom's database
code. There is some incorrect usage of the lisp 'probe-file'
function that no longer corresponds the way 'probe-file' works
in gcl (since gcl-2.6.7). This is actually a bug in the current
Axiom linux source distribution as well! This might explain the
problems that we had recently with trying to compile Martin's
Rubey's new 'guess' package since it means that generating the
new databases might fail.


Patch procedure
---------------

The following is an annotated output from

  $ darcs --diff -u

------

Binary files old-axiom--windows--1-1/zips/gcl-2.6.5.tgz and
new-axiom--windows--1-1/zips/gcl-2.6.5.tgz differ

Because I was too lazy to take the time to properly modify the
Makefile.pamphlet for the new gcl-2.6.8pre build, the first
thing I did was prepare a tarball for gcl2.6.8pre using the
name gcl-2.6.5w

  $ tar xzvf gcl-2.6.8pre.tgz
  $ mv gcl-2.6.8pre gcl-2.6.5w
  $ tar czvf gcl-2.6.5w.tgz gcl-2.6.5w

so that I could just start with the existing Windows sources.

--------

The following patch removes those patches to gcl that no
longer apply

There, that's all there is too it. :-) Now you can build Axiom
on Windows with the newest prerelease version of GCL.

Just curious, can you reproduce the following issues:

No, that is not necessary when running svk - only when doing
that particular install. SVK is working now, but before I
could complete all of the steps in Gaby's recipe at:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSilverBranch

svk was interrupted by Perl exceptions and I had to satisfy
at least 6 more dependencies via cpan. I have just completed
the final checkout from the mirror and everything looks ok.

This svk thing is a real rats nest of Perl dependencies. I
don't understand why these dependencies were not automatically
satisfied during the svk installation procedure. But maybe
because I had so much trouble with installing svn in the
proper way so that svk could talk to it, I somehow managed
to munge that part of the svk install. But if this is the
normal install experience for svk, I certainly wouldn't
recommend it for the inexp=E9riment=E9e.

Anyway, all's well that ends well... Well almost. It turns out
that during the 'svk sync /mirror/axiom' the download from
SourceForge failed about at least 6 times and had to be
manually restarted. That did not happen to be before while
working on the axiom-developer.org server. But at least it
restarted properly without irrecoverably locking any files
or anything.

End result: I still have serious doubts about svn and svk.
:(

Regards,
Bill Page.

I changed the order of function/macro definitions. I changed your
examble a bit to match what actually happened.

%FILE 1
<<*>>=
BLIH  (Should end up in a single chunk with BLUH)
BLOH
BLAH  (Should be in its own chunk)
BLUH  (depends on BLAH, ie has to come after blah in the file)
@
%END FILE1

Now try to chunk this up given those constraints without changing the
order of code.

Besides I deleted many blank lines and obsolete comments. I could've
kept them, but I reckon the cruft should go. Furthermore I'm planning
to be more invasive next time around. I'll eliminate aliases, obsolete
functions etc.

That's what I was planning to do, but it didn't work.

So I don't know how reasonable that would be. Your are certainly better 
off doing it your way. But for your question....

%FILE 2
<<BLIUH>>=
BLIH
<<BLOH>>
<<BLAH>>
BLUH
@
I guess, you don't want the above chunk, because it contains too much, 
right?

<<BLOH>>=
BLOH
@

<<BLAH>>=
BLAH
@

<<*>>=
<<BLIUH>>
@
%END FILE 2

I guess, you are right. Do it your way and restructure so that the 
essence becomes clear. That is much more important then having identical 
  .lisp files. Identical up to permutation of functions is enough for 
lisp files.

Yes, thank you very much. Your description is very useful.

I am quite impressed by how simple it is to use Tailor to move
complete repositories (including all history and revisions) from
one system to another. If we can't have just one common type of
source code respository, then at least we can interoperate.

E pluribus ...

Bill Page.

Not quite. This whole BL*H thing is thoroughly confusing. I'll just
give you the real code (kind of).

File1:

(defmacro alias-for-foo (...)
  [code generating code calling foo])

(defun bar (...)
  ...)

(defun define-function (alias function)
  (setf (symbol-function alias) function))

(define-function alias-for-bob #'bob)

End of File1

FOO and BOB are functions defined elsewhere. Now I wanted to put all
(most) aliases in a single chunk since they don't deserve individual
documentation. Hence the first and last forms above go into a single
chunk:

<<aliases>>=
(defmacro alias-for-foo (...)
  [code generating code calling foo])

(define-function alias-for-bob #'bob)
@

The (defun define-function ...) form has to go before that
chunk. Hence the order changes. I could have done what you suggest and
just referenced the (defun define-function ...) chunk in the aliases
chunk, but I didn't like that.

Of course, I also wanted to delete lots of whitespace and comments
anyway, so the whole point is moot.


Thanks for taking the time to discuss - admittedly boring - details.

Hmmm, I am not sure I can support that approach. For two reasons.

1) Most probably the aliases come in the documentation without links to 
the code they refer to. (Though that can be done.)

2) You separate code that belongs together. Don't you think?

Why would it make sense to list all the abbreviations on one section 
(even without documenation)?

> Thanks for taking the time to discuss - admittedly boring - details.

I don't think that it is "boring". I am sure that most of us have no 
real experience what the best LP style in Axiom would be. Otherwise I 
would have seen a "Conventions" page that explains how to write good 
literate programs. It's not totally clear, at least not for me.

But all our experiences must be collected some day on the wiki or 
another document to help newcomers with this LP style in Axiom. It's 
important.

Ralf

I'm not quite sure what exactly you're getting at.

> 2) You separate code that belongs together. Don't you think?
I suppose you mean that an alias definition should be next to the
definition of the function that it's an alias for? Like

<<foo>>=

(defun foo (...)
  ...)

(define-function alias-for-foo #'foo)
@

That's what I thought at first, but then it occured to me that

1) Aliases in general aren't terribly useful. The only exception I can
   think of is the following. Suppose you have an operation acting on
   objects of type FOO, say COMPARE-FOOS. Now it happens that the
   definition of that function is

     (defun compare-foos (&rest foos)
       (apply #'equal foos))

   In this case it is acceptable to create COMPARE-FOOS, because it
   captures a different concept. This is also useful if you later
   change the implementation of objects of type FOO, and you can't
   just compare them with EQUAL. In that case you simply change the
   implementation of COMPARE-FOOS. If you'd use EQUAL directly, you'd
   have to check each and every EQUAL in your source to figure out
   wether it has to be adapted to the new implementation of FOOs.

   Other than that I don't see any justification for aliases.

2) To be useful in the sense described above, an alias needs a good
   name. Almost all the aliases in VMLISP.LISP.PAMPHLET have terrible
   names. Here is a small sample:

     (defmacro absval (x)
       `(abs ,x))

     (defmacro intp (x)
       `(integerp ,x))

     (define-function 'U-CASE #'upcase)
     (define-function 'LC2UC #'upcase)
     (define-function 'L-CASE #'downcase)

     (define-function 'EVA1 #'eval) ;EVA1 and VMLISP EVAL make lexicals visible
     (define-function 'EVALFUN #'eval) ;EVALFUN drops lexicals before evaluating
     (define-function 'EVA1FUN #'EVALFUN)

     (define-function 'vm/ #'quotient)

   Note that apparently a single function can act differently
   depending on what it's called.

   I believe that all the aliases in the 'Aliases' section should be
   removed or at least renamed. I admit to being inconsistent, as
   there are many aliases that are not in that list, even though I
   often made a comment pointing out that they should be removed. One
   example is MAKE-VEC, which is defined as

     (defun make-vec (n)
       (make-array n))

   I'm not sure why this one got through. Another example is DSETQ,
   which is an alias for DODSETQ.

The 'Aliases' section contains only those aliases that I think should
be removed from Axiom. It so happens that almost all the aliases in
VMLISP.LISP.PAMPHLET qualify.

> Why would it make sense to list all the abbreviations on one section
> (even without documenation)?
Because they're all obsolete. That section is a list of things to
remove. Since that requires changing a lot of code (trivially), I
didn't do it (yet; I'm actually waiting for Tim's opinion on this,
before I go ahead and get rid of them).

Not to me, either. When I read your first response to my VMLISP.LISP
conversion I actually thought about that. I was going to suggest that
you put up the example you gave (the Groebner basis fragment).

It is. That doesn't really make discussing the intricate details of
chunking exciting, though. ;-)

Have you, for example ever used

at the end of a code chunk? noweave can generated hyperlinks inside the

I cannot say much about that. I am not a LISP programmer. :-(

Hmmm, in that case, the section would not be forever. So I am with you.

All I can put onto the net is already there. My experience of 
programming in LP style is at the ALLPROSE website. I am sure that I am 
not perfect, but the whole thing is a bit bigger than just dhmatrix.

And I am currently doing something here...

svn co svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk combinat
cd combinat/combinat
make colored dvi

in a similar style. But all that is not LISP, but you might get an idea 
how I think Axiom should look like.

Maybe I should have tried to explain this better, since I don't think
that this is specific to Lisp. In general, when does it make sense to
have several different names for a single function? Not very often,
I'd say.

I looked at your ALLPROSE when Martin mentioned it to me. It's quite
impressive as far as I can see, but I didn't spend enough time with it
to say anything about it.

I'll take a look.

Noweb has a powerful concept of filters. If you somewhere find a filter 
that adds such things for lisp or write one yourself, you don't need to 
add that by hand.

For example, in the Aldor part of ALLPROSE, there is no need to add %def 
statements. Just a littl convention of how to write code... the rest is 
done by a script at "make dvi" time.

I sometimes use macros in Aldor, but I try to keep that restricted to 
one file. The outside world should only see one thing.

Well ALLPROSE is basically just for Aldor code, but as you see, it is a 
literate program by itself and that means it documents its Makefiles, 
latex-style files and PERL files. So, if you forget about the Aldor 
part, it could probably also support the documentation of LISP code.

I'll wait until I find time to understand Gaby's new build process to 
move some ideas from ALLPROSE to the Axiom code.

I tried the same with eigen.spad.pamphlet. As a beginning I structured
the file, commented the functions I understand (although sometimes what
I wrote seems rather obvious) and began to write a little about the
theory.=20

I put the file in the wiki-source, so hopefully somebody comes up with
some kind of criticism. This is just a first try and I welcome
tips/ideas what to change. Hopefully I didn't made any content related
errors?

Tree additional questions concerning the literate source I have by now:

    How much theory belongs in a pamphlet? For example after a nice
    description what the gr=F6berner basis algorithm does, is it important
    why it terminates? Or is a reference here enough?=20

    If every file should be as elaborate as dhmatrix.spad, shouldn't one
    have a central point where the notation and foundations stuff gets
    clarified? Else, one would have to introduce the notation of
    vectors, matrics etc. again in every file that uses them. Maybe one
    should have a latex-style-convention in the wiki.

    How formal should a pamphlet be? Rather a heuristically description
    what happens (with reference) or better Definiton, Theorem ... ?=20

The first check is whether it builds correctly.  Or as Bill suggested,
check the notangle result against that of the previous file.

I don't know if there's a good answer to this.  My personal feeling is
that as much relevant information should be there as the author has
time to add, since many people may not be able to get to the referenced
articles without being at a university, but it's a judgement call -
obviously you don't want the entire life history of the major
researchers in the field as part of the pamphlet.  

I guess my response would be don't worry - just write what you think
best, and it can always be improved.  As long as the content is
accurate, it's going to be an improvement over what we have now!

Again, that's a judgement call.  I personally think it should go
something like this:

a)  In the files that implement vectors, matrix logic, and tensors a
full discussion should be present of the issues of syntax concerning
defining, displaying, and representing those objects according to major
mathematical conventions.

b)  In more specific files, a brief discussion of the points relevant
to the case in question along with a link to the main pamphlet(s) on
the issue would make sense.  If some specific conventions or syntax are
defined for the given topic, that should be discussed in the pamphlet. 
Also subject specific conventions which are not part of the wider
mathematical conventions should be covered.

Again, that's just me.  But a full treatment of a subject isn't
necessary when proposing a change - incremental improvements are also
welcome!

I don't think we're going to be universal on that right now - just
write as you prefer, and if at some point we decide on a general
convention we can go back and retool the pamphlets to all conform.  At
this point it is far more critical to get good, accurate literate
content - we don't want to drive away contributions due to style
nitpicks.  Those kinds of things can be fixed later.

My 2c,

CY

Great! Cliff and I were actually hoping that others might join the

I don't know Spad and I didn't check the content so far, but as far as
I can tell it looks really nice.

I have a few questions/comments:

1) Shouldn't mathematical symbols always be set in math mode, ie. 'the
   field $F$' instead of 'the field F'?

2) Isn't maybe 'Theory' a nicer heading than 'The underlying theory'?
   It's shorter and conveys the same information. Clearly a matter of
   style, though.

3) How about bibliography entries for introductory books or online
   articles on eigenvalues?

I would think so, too. Maybe one could have include files for
different purposes, eg one for linear algebra, another one for group
theory etc.

It would be really nice to have a somewhat unified notation. Since
defining one is an awful lot of work, maybe we could borrow some ideas
from the different math sites on the web (MathWorld, for example).


Thanks a lot,
Kai

PS: I tried to edit the page to remove a typo or two, but it kept

edit other pages. Any idea?

Hello!

It seems that slowly people are starting to bring legacy code into a=20
literate programming style. That is good and very important.

On 09/23/2006 12:23 PM, Frithjof Schulze wrote:

Don't worry. Whatever you do is probably better than leaving the file as =

it is. The whole thing will be an iterative process. And why is that?=20
Because nobody at this mailing list has come forward to define a=20
definite style for pamphlets. I am probably right that there is no such=20
thing for Axiom pamphlets as a style guide.

Now, knowing that there is no help for you, the best thing you can do is =

to invent your own style and make it public.

The only stuff that I could see on the wiki is linked here...

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/PamphletFiles

It is already something, especially=20
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/PamphletExample
but currently it completely neglects the fact that there is relation=20
between the different pamphlet files and that nowadays we should not=20
just reference them via the bibliography, but via hyperlinks.

> I put the file in the wiki-source,

would it have been too hard to provide the URL directly? If you want to=20
have help, make it nearly zero-effort for potential contributors.

Hmmm... the first thing YOU have to make sure is that your local copy of =

the Axiom sources still compiles without error (including the testcases).=


Whether you wrote good or bad content into the latex part of the=20
pamphlet is another question that needs review by other developers.
But the semantics should not change (at least not now or not too=20
drastically). In fact, I believe it must be made easier to add=20
testcases. Does somebody have a quick guide or reference of how to add=20
new testcases to Axiom?

Good question. My current experience says: it depends.

If we now document every simple detail we will never reach a status=20
where Axiom becomes the leading research platform.

But think of Axiom as being (one of) THE leading research platform(s)=20
then the only place where the theory is (should be) is in the pamphlet=20
since there is no other reference in the world. You are inventing the=20
theory and deliver the code together with the theory. So that says: all=20
of the theory should be in the pamplet.

However, there is hundreds and hundreds of books about mathematics and=20
algorithms around that I believe should (currently) not being rewritten=20
in the form of pamphlets. I think, it is enough for certain well-known=20
algorithms to include one (or better several) easily accessible=20
references (including references to other existing implementations).

That is for now. In the long run I would even like to see standard=20
algorithms documented in a self-contained way in a pamphlet. It=20
basically means that Axiom should become not only a leading CAS, but a=20
source for learning about algorithms and the underlying theory.

To make that possible, sooner or later we have to start that=20
Axiom-Journal thing.

If you now think in terms of a journal, then a pamphlet is like an=20
article. Although one can consider a pamphlet as a container for several =

code files, I am not so convinced that it is the right way to do it. For =

me it is perfectly OK, if you deliver a .tar.gz archive with several=20
pamphlets to the journal for review. As in a true journal that archive=20
should describe one (new) idea.

All I want to say is that not the file is the basic unit but the=20
idea/topic that is described. So for example, the whole build process of =

Axiom should be described in one document (in dvi/ps/pdf/html/...=20
format), but not necessarily in just one .pamphlet. I don't care much=20
how the sources are mapped onto the hard disk. What matters is that I=20
get something readable, I understand the process/idea/topic and I am=20
able to click and my editor opens exactly at right position in the right =

file if I want to correct something.

That is basically what I provide with ALLPROSE. It is a framework to=20
produce a whole Aldor library. An I consider such a library as ONE unit=20
no matter on how many files it is distributed internally. It describes=20
or rather should describe one idea/topic.

We had that before with the latex-style convention. It is not possible.=20
There are too many latex packages around and they are not all=20
compatible. We simply cannot fix the number of packages that we allow=20
since that is too much of a restriction to potential contributors. We=20
could have a journal style of how things should normally come out, but=20
it's impossible to think of every detail in advance.

>     How formal should a pamphlet be? Rather a heuristically description=

>     what happens (with reference) or better Definiton, Theorem ... ?=20

First approximation, guess and document what you've found out about the=20
legacy code. Next approximation, make that all more formal, add=20
definitions, theorems, PROOFS. A pamphlet should be a scientific=20
document, not just a code description. So finally, a pamphlet *is* as=20
formal as a journal article. (And is hopefully even formally reviewed.=20
And maybe later automatically verified by a proof checker -- that would=20
be cool!)

I hope that was not too long...

So first add your question to the FAQ page then open up=20
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/PamphletStyle. And add your experience=20
and vision of how pamphlets should look like. Hopefully, we will soon=20
have some good guideline for new contributors.

Unfortunately all introductory textbooks I know are in german, but I
will look if I can find something appropriate. Also I don't really know
how to set mathematics in latex. Do you know about an introduction?
There is a lot about what fonts and symbols exists, but I would need
something about when to use what font or mode.

Yes. And there should be a reference some where in the wiki. Even if it
is just a reference which pamphlet defines a special notation.

Is it possible that I locked the page with zope-external-edit? It still
doesn't really works here.

But even if you find some english reference, add the german references, too.

Under Linux I find ... (otherwise google...)

/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/amsmath/*.dvi.gz

amsldoc.dvi and testmath.dvi should give you quite a lot of examples of 
how to do advanced stuff.

You don't usually have to care much about fonts in LaTeX, the symbols, 
however, you find, for example at the end of

/usr/share/texmf/doc/amstex/amsguide.dvi.gz

(But don't consider much the other stuff, since it describes AMS-TeX not 
AMS-LaTeX.)

If you then still have problems ask again.

Yes, axiom still compiles and testing a little by hand everything still
works fine.

Are the testcases tried if I just recompile axiom or do I have compile
the whole program? There is no "test" clause or so in the Makefile.

That is in a way what I thought to do the other way round:
Learn about the algorithms and thereby documenting axiom.

No. What you wrote could actually be used in the wiki.

I don't have that much 'visions' now. It will take some time until
there is a whole guideline, but I will start one.

Great job! I am really glad that you invested time in doing this
work. I think it is excellent contributioin ot Axiom. I hope that
this work by you, Kai and Cliff is part of a trend ... :-)

The first thing I would strongly suggest is that if you make
extensive changes like this to a pamphlet then you *should* add
your name as an author. We do want to recognize people for the
contributions they make. Ultimately perhaps, the authors/editors
of these pamphlets might wish to add them to their personal list
of papers and publications. In many cases these contributions
should count as research.

Of course getting the details right is important but just getting
started is sometimes the hardest part. But I didn't find any problems
in what you wrote and I learned several things about the Axiom eigen
package that I didn't know before. Thanks.

I think references are important. Use web references if you can.
I suggest using hyperref to add clickable links directly in the
LaTeX source.

I think including a short section on notation in each pamphlet
would be good enough for now.

Starting with just a heuristic description is fine. If you are
able to make some formal definitions and add a theorem or two
that might make the mathematician more comfortable :-) but it
is not necessary at this point - especially if you can find some
basic references.

Editing this page works for me. It did not prompt me to register

Are you still having problems?

Poking around in the interp code, a couple of questions arise.

The first one is whether there is a grammar for the SPAD language.  If
memory serves, the answer to this is no there is not, but there is a
grammar for Aldor.

There has been some discussion in the past about programs like cl-yacc
that can generate a parser for a language based on its grammar.  I
don't know if a program like that could handle SPAD/Aldor->Lisp, but if
it could using it would solve two problems:

1)  It would force us to develop an actual grammar for the language
Axiom is using.

2)  It would help avoid the need to tangle with the maze of boot/spad
definitions we currently are using for this process by generating the
code we need in (hopefully) a cleaner, more modern style.

If such a generator really works, it has the additional benefit of
making it much simpler to put new ideas about language behavior into
practice.  Unfortunately parsers and language grammars seem to be
something of a non-trivial topic.  Is there anyone here for whom that
would be an interesting direction to work?

Cheers,
CY

I don't know for SPAD, but the Aldor User Guide (see aldor.org) gives a 
grammar for Aldor.

How else could Christian Aistleitner have written a parser for Aldor?

Bill, hasn't Christian sent you the code? Is that somewhere public? What 
license?

Alfredo,

I have finally updated the MathAction darcs repository
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MathActionRepository to include
the changes I made to MathAction to support Sage \begin{sageblock}
and \sage{...} commands.

Do you have some time available to add this to the DoyenCD?

You should use:

  darcs pull http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/latexwiki

to get these updates for Sage support. As usual, take care to
modify the paths in the code appropriately for Doyen.

I would like to be able to distribute the DoyenCD with Doyen Wiki
support for Sage at the upcoming Sage Days 2 in Seattle, October
6-10. I will be attending the meeting and especially the coding
sprint sessions where I plan to do my best to implement a first
version of a Sage interface for Axiom. This would mean that Sage
users would be able to use Axiom the same way they use Maxima now.

http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/days2
http://sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org/days2

If you could put up a version of Doyen with Sage support on the web,
I would also like to add a few pages to the wiki that demonstrate
how to use Sage (derived from those on MathAction) so that they can
be included on the DoyenCD.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Alfredo,

'sagetex.sty' is part of the Sage distribution. Look in your

   sage-root/examples/latex_embed

On axiom-developer look at:

  /home/page/sage-1.3.6.2/examples/latex_embed

I used everything from this directory just as it is with no
modifications. I added 'sagetex.sty' to the LaTeX style
directories in the same place as 'axiom.sty'. The only slightly
tricky thing was to locate 'sagetex.py' where it could be
found by sage (answer: var/LatexWiki).

You will see that 'sagetex.sty' and 'sagetex.py' must work
together.

Bill Page.

your version
on MathAction.

Dr. William Stein was very interested to see your presentation on
Doyen. I think you might find some of the weekend talks interesting
(see attached email) and you help during the coding sprints would
be most welcome. :-)

Do not delay about making travel plans when you get approval to go
and contact the meeting organizers as soon as possible to confirm.
Apparently hotel accomodations in Seattle are getting a little tight
for that weekend.

Thanks.

I see a problem with the Maxima output on this page. The $ should not
be present. I recall that you had to change the Maxima output parsing
regular expression because of a difference between Maxima built with
clisp (on Doyen) versus Maxima built with GCL (on MathAction). Do you
have a solution for this problem? If not, I can look into it.

Regards,
Bill Page.

The issue I had found was that on Solaris, ctime_r was a no-op.  In
general, there are quite a few interesting fields in struct stat that
we might want to see, the question is in what form, in particular,
machine or human readable.  Here are other possibilities:

the protection mode (likely not very portable?)
uid/gid
access time/modification time
char device/block device/fifo/socket?

Now that I read the manpage, we could use ctime itself, as it returns
a pointer to statically allocated memory.  In general, we should avoid
any libc calls which call malloc due to the memory fragmentation
effects on ht e GCL heap.  I'm not sure if the ascii time string is
more useful, as one would have to write a parser to manipulate it.

Take care,

Axiom is actually a collection of processes. The top level process is
sman (superman) which starts and controls other processes, including
AXIOMsys (the interpreter), viewman (the graphics) and hyperdoc.

All of the processes communicate thru sockets.

Viewman does all of the drawing work using X11.

Yes, the problem for me is darcs is really slow on my computer.  I might
as well consider switching to mercurial.  The fact it is coded in
Python, a language in which I'm more fluent than in Haskell, is also a
strong point in its favor.

IIRC, there are lots of problems with the grammar. For example,  
parenthesis do not occur in the grammar.
Anyone ever written a considerable Aldor program not using parenthesis?

According to my mail client, I sent the code to Bill on 2005-10-20  
11:19:33 CEST.
I wrote to the mailing list the same day saying that anyone who wants to  
have the code, should drop me a line. I found no lines in my inbox.

You can save the Axiom graphics output to files and run the 
program called ViewAlone on them. There are many examples
of saved output in the source tree. See 
src/graph/viewAlone/parabola.VIEW

The VMLISP file exists because the original sources were in MACLISP
and were ported to VMLISP. Eventually they were ported to an early
version of common lisp. 

The basic strategy was to leave the sources unchanged and write
common lisp equivalents for the maclisp and vmlisp functions were
possible. Many functions like EvalAndFileACTQ were possible to 
emulate closely enough that "it works for axiom". We were not
trying for generality. When we couldn't write the equivalent
function we rewrote the code.

This work was done in parallel with the development of AKCL.
Bill Schelter developed AKCL under contract to IBM and I helped
with some of that developement. Not all of the functions in 
common lisp existed or worked at the time.

Macros were used instead of 'Inline' because macro-expanded code
could be better optimized than 'inline' directive code. Many
tests were made by using the disassemble function and counting
actual machine instructions generated. In theory the two are
equivalent but in practice they are not.

any chance you could capture some of this insight as

This defines 2 functions.

> 
> (defun bar (...)
>   (blah blub))
> 
> (defun foo (...)
>   (let ((...))
>     (bar ...)))
> 

This defines a function and a "top level form".
The first expression is evaluated and returns a function.
The second expression is immediately evaluated for effect.

> and
> 
> <<foo>>=
> (defun foo (...)
>   (let ((...))
>     <<do-bar>>))
> @
>

Depending on the situation the value of the top level form
could have other side effects.

The 'alias' functions were defined following the philosophy of
writing VMLISP functions in common lisp rather than changing
the source code to be common lisp. This was the general porting
strategy we used in the past.

Keep in mind that we only need the alias function to perform the
specific task that axiom needs. In general the cover functions are
not even close to being equivalent but they cover the semantics
needed by axiom.

At the present time the code rewrite is removing many of these
functions completely. Bookvol5.pamphlet will not only be common 
lisp but will be ANSi common lisp. The net effect is that files
like vmlisp will go away.

> 1) Aliases in general aren't terribly useful.

In general they are not. But if you want to provide porting
functions that cover the semantics of two different functions
it is useful in lisp to just store a pointer in the function
cell of a symbol. It's a porting technique, not a useful
idea in general.




I should point out that you have to be VERY CAREFUL in axiom.
Not all function names that are used show up in the source.
This is NOT OBVIOUS. Axiom dynamically constructs some function
names so you cannot just grep to decide if something is being
used or not.

Plus Axiom plays some optimization games. Functions are initially
defined as 'autoload' which is just a trigger function. On first
use the trigger function loads the actual code which replaces the
function definition so it will have the correct definition on the
second and subsequent uses. There are other automatic 'inline'
operations that occur in order to speed up computation.

> Indeed.  That os very annoying for debug sessions. :-(

debugging optimized code is always hard.
gcc does code-motion, loop unrolling, beta substitution, operator
promotion and many other things that make gdb sessions a pain.
ultimately it's the final disassemble instruction counts that matter.

No. The DO-BAR chunk is included in the FOO chunk. Hence (BLAH BLUB)
ends up in the body of FOO and is not a toplevel form. Of course, the
two snippets differ in that one defines a function and the other does
not. But in a Lisp program I'd very much prefer the former, since it's
easier to understand and to work with. If performance is an issue, an
INLINE-declaration might help.

It is not a toplevel form.

Hi Tim,

I put your last two messages about the aliases in VMLISP.LISP
together, I hope you don't mind.

Sure.

I thought so, which is one of the reasons I didn't actually remove
anything. If we remove a function that's actually used, we'll notice
pretty soon, though.

What is this optimizing for? Memory? Is it still necessary?

That's what I was trying to help with. The whole thing grew out of the
recent GUI discussion. Since there is no broad consensus on the GUI
and several other questions, Cliff and I tried to find a minimal
common ground. We finally agreed that chunking up and documenting
Axiom's internals is a useful project, that anyone can participate
in.

How do you access the SF x86-linux1 machine? I used to have
access but the method I used (via cf.sourceforge.net) stopped
working a few weeks ago and I haven't been able to access any
of the compile farm machines since that time.

I think the effects of low memory can be unpredictable. You

the build-improvements branch uses the newest gcl-2.6.8pre.

I've been doing a binary search (which gives me a chance to appreciate

Cool. I wonder why no one at SourceForge ever mentioned that
this is possible?

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=3Ddetail&atid=3D200001&aid=3D155345=
6&gro

Or why the compile farm docs don't mention it except for remote
commmand execution? 'course I shoulda thought of trying that...

You mean there once was a version of build.improvements that did
compile in such small memory? You did not explain this earlier.

Do you suspect some Axiom coding error??? Or are you talking
about a different issue. It is no longer clear to me.

I'm sorry for not being clear.  The newest gcl-2.6.8pre has been on
the build-improvements branch since
September 17; see zips/ChangeLog.build-improvements

    2006-09-17  Gabriel Dos Reis  <gdr@cs.tamu.edu>

            * gcl-2.6.8pre.tgz: Update.

and it contains patches that Camm and you worked on (I believe).

For the moment, the build seems to be broken except on my two
machines.  Once, it is back to normal I'll ping you for test.

Before blaming Axiom, I prefer to blame myself first -- the makefiles
are very tricky and what can appear as a small change in a Makefile
can have far reaching fallouts in Lisp codes (especially in src/interp
where I'm having this problem) because of very poor or lack of
abstractions. 

>From the description you gave, it looks to me like my failures may

Axiom, it takes long to make progress.

Too much context was removed by Tim in his reply and there was
no reference to the specific email to which this was a reply so
at first I thought: What is this all about? :-(

Then I tried to understand from

http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/glo_t.html#top_level_form

"top level form n. a form which is processed specially by
compile-file for the purposes of enabling compile time
evaluation of that form. Top level forms include those forms
which are not subforms of any other form, and certain other
cases. See Section 3.2.3.1 (Processing of Top Level Forms)."

and

http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/sec_3-2-3-1.html

what is meant by "top level form" in the discussion below but
failed.

Is this distinction relevant to the discussion?

>From my point of view 'bar' is something defined at one level,
i.e. at the "lisp" level. Whereas 'do-bar' is something
defined at a "higher" level, i.e. as a chunk name in the
pamphlet file or the "literate program" level.

Kai writes: "But in a Lisp program I'd very much prefer the
former [bar], since it's easier to understand and to work
with."

To me this raises an important question of the point-of-view
one should have when writing literate programs: Is it correct
to think of oneself as working "in a Lisp program" or should
we think of this first of all as a document?

The noweb <<do-bar>> chunk reference looks like and performs
like a macro expansion in the underlying programming language
even though it is actually done at the time of notangle,
prior to the compilation. From the point-of-view of the static
document perhaps <<do-bar>> is ease to understand. Presumably
one defines <<do-bar>>=3D because it has a special significance
and/or is a sub-expression that occurs frequently in the
source and deserves to be singled out and explained separately
in the documentation.

But Kai is apparently thinking in terms of working at the lisp
REPL and/or some debugging level where it might be more
convenient to have a name that lisp understands such as 'bar'.
Lisp does not understand the pamphlet format and cannot use
the name 'do-bar'... but maybe it should! When debugging
lisp programs derived from pamphlet source files maybe it
would make sense to have available some "noweb-aware" tools
that allowed simple reference to code chunks? E.g.

  (setq pamphlet-file "vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet")
  (pamphlet-chunk "do-bar")

etc.

Would this allow the lisp programmer/debugger to more easily
cross the gap between her lisp program and the pamphlet
source?

Or am I missing the point of this discussion?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi,

  The time it takes to build Axiom is prohibitive.  

If the build is done only once a day, that is probably alright.
However, when several iterations are done in a day, it becomes
unbearable.   

What can be done to improve the build time?

After eliminating the obvious like avoiding building the docs
and running the tests, the next thing you probably need to do
is find a way to compile SPAD faster. Right now, interpsys is
loaded and compiles a single SPAD file, then quits for each of
1,042 files. In principle it should be possible to compile many
SPAD files in a single call to interpsys - say one call per
layer in the algebra build.

Also, interpsys (really the embedded GCL) runs gcc for each
SPAD compile to compile the generated lisp to object code.
Is there some way to make starting gcc faster?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Not that I know of, given current Axiom architecture.

Offline, Camm, Bob Boyer and I have been exploring the idea of
integrating GCL to GCC (long term project).  Bob suggested that we
somehow find a way to have GCL not to start parsing over and over
again the same include file (cmpinclude.h).  
Maybe the precompiled header capability would be an option but I doubt
it gains us a significant speed up in the Axiom case, but who knows;
we have to try.

In fact, as I noted already there is a tiny flaw in the current bootstrap
process.

When adding several layers of spad files, as I did for my guessing package, one
has to add each layer one at the time, and has to call make as

make DAASE=$AXIOM/../../int 

Otherwise the newly built algebra files will not be in the database that
interpsys uses: it uses those in ${SRC}/share by default.

Thus, I think the Makefile should really work as follows:

 * for each layer
  
 *   start interpsys
  
 *   compile all files in the layer
  
 *   create the databases

from the second iteration on, of course, it should use the new databases.

HOWEVER: quite certainly, this will make the build process slower, instead of
faster, for two reasons:

* It takes quite some time to create the databases

* compiling slows down when several files are compiled. Certainly this is a
  bug, but I have no idea where to find it...

Of course, the latter can be circumvented by starting a fresh interpsys for
every file that gets compiled, just as it is done now.

I guess, the best way to speed up the build process is to document the
compiler.

Martin

We should find ways to speed up the database manipulation.

Also, Tim, I noticed that currently the database format is a mix of
two beast.  What is the "right" direction and what are your plans?

yes; but we have to speed up the compiler (and probably GCL too).

| * compiling slows down when several files are compiled. Certainly this is a

| 
| Of course, the latter can be circumvented by starting a fresh interpsys for

but, that is very slow.  The compiler should be able to compiler
several files in row.

I traced the issue down to an obscure dependency in the toplevel
Makefile. Axiom build on SF x86-linux1 has been going on for a while
now.  It is at algebra layer 13, but I don't think it would be completed
before I take off to office.  This is the first time I'm having a
build of axiom.build-improvements going that far on a debian-based 
system.  I suspect that is encouraging.

three possibilities.... first, the whole point of using 'make'
is that you don't have to do a full build except the first time.
unfortunately you are working on the makefiles which is a very
rare situation. i know it is painful (from experience) but it
would be useless to optimize build times since almost no-one
else will have the problem.

second, do machine-parallel builds. fix a problem on one machine
and while it builds, move to the next machine.

third, have the build check for obj/sys/bin/lisp and if it exists
skip the lisp build step (unless you are hacking that makefile).

If you have questions about Plone, ZWiki or Zope, please feel

In retrospect I think there was no especially good reason to
choose ZWiki/LatexWiki - only the timing and a matter of
convenience. Plus it turned out that the maintainer of the LaTeX
extension for ZWiki (Bob McElrath) happened also to be interested
in Axiom. :-)

It is amusing to me that ZWiki is not shown in this comparison.
At the time (almost three years ago) there were very few other
wiki's that included support for LaTeX. On another project I
had already had some experience with Plone and Zope. ZWiki is
written in Python using Zope as the web application server and
object-oriented database. I consider this a "higher-level"
application development environment compared to some other
scripting languages and choice of database or file system. But
this is large a subject matter of "taste".

>=20

I have looked at Twiki, and used both MediaWiki and Moinmoin. I
think all three of these now have optional LaTeX support.

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/MathModePlugin
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki_math_markup
http://johannes.sipsolutions.net/Projects/new-moinmoin-latex

And they all could probably quite easily be adapted to interface
with Axiom and other computer algebra packages the way that
ZWiki/MathAction does now.

MediaWiki is famous because it is the software that runs Wikipedia.
The Sage project is using Moinmoin possibly because it is written
in Python which is also the implementation language for Sage. But
Moinmoin does not use Zope so it is simpler in that respect.

The "wiki syntax" in all of these systems was originally intended
to be very simple to use so as not to represent any barrier for
new users, but this goal has in most cases been abandoned because
it turns out that people do care about the format. Most of these
systems have some form of "WYSIWYG page editing" which is supposed
to be easy for new users to create nicely formatted pages. Moinmoin
in particular has a very nice editor.  ZWiki has this as an option
but I have turned it off because unfortunately it does not work
properly with the LatexWiki embedded LaTeX commands.

Actually I am rather surprised by the relatively slow rate of
adoption of the wiki concept but on the other hand, after three
years of watching closely it is clear to me that it is very
gradually growing in popularity - not declining.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Make isn't the problem.  As the system currently stands, when
something is modified it is recommended to delete the build tree and
start afresh -- doing otherwise only brings false positives (or
negatives depending on how you count).  I've been bitten enough to
know that for the moment, it is always the "first time".

I doubt I'm alone; or if I'm alone, I doubt I'll stay alone for long
time.  Unless Axiom stays with only 2 "coders", I suspect this issue
needs to be addressed somehow. I have some students who will be poking at
various parts of the system.  I would hate they spend most of their
time waiting for the compiler.

I solved this issue:  It was me forgtetting to specify $(ENV) before

Now, I can ressurect my work on the boot directory (which I partly
lost while digging this issue).

Alfredo and Gaby,

I think we should get the Google repository reloaded ASAP.

I also agree. But to do that we *must* get the Google Code
masters to reset our svn repository on Google back to zero.
Since we do not have svnadmin access to the repository this
is apparently something that we can not do ourselves. Any
change that we make (including deletions!) do not result any
any decrease in the amount of space already used in the
repository files. We need to start again from an empty
repository state.

Alfredo, will you please contact Google and ask them to reset
it?

I have SVK running reliably now on the axiom-developer.org
server. With SVK it is possible to transfer an entire repository
from one location to another without having svnadmin export
import access. For example as described here:

http://svk.elixus.org/?RecoverSVNMasterFromSVKMirror

I would like to try this, but first we need to have an empty
repository on Google and not just one that "appears" to be
that way. :-)

Meanwhile I am still having fun using Tailor to convert from one
type of repository to another svn<->darcs<->hg and experimenting
with mercurial versus darcs...

If SVK doesn't work out, then I am sure that I can persuade Tailor
to also do svn <-> svn from one location to another. But since
SVK is native to svn, I think we should try that first. Both of
these can be run periodically via crontab so that no manual
intervention would be involved in keeping at least one-way
mirrors up to date. (Two-way involves the potential to that
one might have to manually resolve conflicts.)

I am still struggling with get svn installed in server mode
on axiom-developer.org but I hope to have more time to work
on that soon.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I contacted him.  He is not directly related to the hosting team but
did ask them.  As you reported, the team was concerned about storing
some tarballs in the Axiom sources.  

For this particular issue of "emptying" the repo, do you want me to
contact them or do you prefer to handle it?

Not applied. Is it necessary (I do not have time to look at it) ?
It seems to me if 'dir' is a directory. Bill, or any other, do you
know how we can trigger this bug (in the interpreter for example)?

Since gcl-2.6.7 'probe-file' in gcl returns Nil if it's argument
is a directory so any place that it was used in the Axiom Lisp
code for it's side-effect of expanding a directory name to it's
truename would be in error.

These patches had not be previously applied to the Windows
version of the Axiom source because it was still bases on
gcl-2.6.5.

'make-databases' is not used in the Axiom interpreter. It is
only used during the build from source. It is a function with
two parameters:

interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet:

  (defun make-databases (ext dirlist) ...

and the affected code is:

  (localdatabase nil
     (list (list '|dir| (namestring (truename "./")) ))
     'make-database)
  (dolist (dir dirlist)
          (localdatabase nil
                         (list (list '|dir|
                                     (namestring (probe-file
                                                  (format nil "./~a"
                                                          dir)))))
                         'make-database))

...

But in etc/Makefile.pamphlet, which is the only place where
make=3Ddatabases is called, we see:

  echo ')lisp (make-databases "" nil)' | ${INTERPSYS} )

so the net effect is that the above bug is not manifest in the
current build but this patch is desirable for possible future
application and consistency.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Unfortunately it does not work. :(

After several attempts using SVK, first trying the mirroring
method that I mentioned earlier, and then later using just a
simple 'commit' of the most recent revision of trunk from
the Axiom Silver, the result is the same error message:

  "Could not write svndiff to temp file: No space left on device"

My conclusion is that "if" we really do have 250Mbytes for the
repository on Google Code, then there must be something else
wrong with the system configuration because it certainly should
be possible to commit at least the most recent revision of trunk.

In those cases were I could get feedback from svn while it was
working, it seemed that this error occurred while trying to commit
a single large file from the zips directory - probably the gcl
tarball (about 20 Mbytes). That's large but not *that* large...
I wonder if the Google server is using some very limited
temporary space, e.g. a overly small /tmp volume or something
like that?

Another thought is perhaps svn is not properly recognizing the
tarball as binary? I am not sure if it makes sense for svn to
be writing an 'svndiff' for such a file.

I don't really know where to go from here on Google Code. It
is very awkward not having shell and svnadmin access to that
server.

On the axiom-developer.org server I am continuing to work towards
setting up our own svn server while subversion seems to keep
trying to "subvert" me at almost every step! ;) But setting up
complete mirrors of our SourceForge subversion archive with both
Darcs and Mercurial using Tailor to automatically keep them in
sync only took a couple of hours.

Regards,
Bill Page.

>=20

Actually I now suspect the problem occurs on our side of
the process - not Google's. Our axiom-developer.org server
is configured with a very small /tmp (tmpfs) space - only
16 Mbytes! If svn is trying to stuff all of the tarball into
this small space, it is bound to fail.

Many applications allow one to define an environment variable
to override the placement of files in /tmp, e.g.

  export TEMP=3D/anywhere/else

I was not able to determine if this is possible with svn/SVK
or not but I am running another batch job now with this
option to see if my commit will run to completion.

Stay tuned...

Regards,
Bill Page.

build-depsys is supposed to be an interface between the lisp world and
the "makefile" world.  However, it lacks abstraction.  Basically, it
takes (among other things) six parameters for directories, just to use
only one to build a path for some files to lookup>  It does so bt
concatening that directory path with "/interp/".  It could just take
that directory aas argument.  Fixed thusly.
build-interpsys has similr behaviour.

built and tested on an i868-pc-linux-gnu.

Type UnivariateTaylorSeries into the browse filed of HyperDoc then press
"Constructors". FINE.

Now try the same thing with

   UnivariateTaylor*

and you get the message "There is no constructor matching pattern 
"UnivariateTaylor*"

Anybody else experiences that problem?

As far as I recall, that never worked. Hm, it does seem to work for operations

Yes, this is definitely a client-side error.  When the svn client
sends a file to the server (during a commit), it uses xdelta to
diff-encode the data into a temporary file, then the neon library (an
http client library) pushes the tmpfile over the wire.

As an experiment, you might want to create a local repository, and
have svk push the full history from the original repository to another
local repository.

Hello,


I want to work in the boot package. Is it possible from the interpreter
to open a gcl prompt with all the Axiom packages loaded and, it's _very
important_, all the internal variables set? If I work with depsys some
variables are not set so its behavior is different. Just an example
(MERGE-PATHNAMES "TEST") in depsys returns #p"/usr/local/axiom/mnt/TEST"
but in the interpreter it returns "#p"TEST" or #p"/home/greg/Axiom/TEST"
if I modified the AXIOM default directory with ')cd /home/greg/Axiom'.
Of course I know that it's possible to use ')lisp lisp-code' but this is
not practical.

Greg

There are at least several ways.



The one I usually use is to type:

  -> )lisp (setq |$DALYMODE| t)

This is a special mode of the interpreter.
ANY expression that starts with an open paren is 
interpreted as a lisp expression. Thus, after you
do this you can type lisp expressions at the prompt:

  -> (+ 2 3)
Value = 5





Another method is to type:

  -> )lisp (break)

which will put you into a lisp break loop (a recursive
version of the top level loop). To return back to axiom type
 
BOOT>> :q

at the lisp prompt.




A third method is to type:

  -> )lisp (throw |$intTopLevel| nil)

which will put you back into the lisp top level. To return
to axiom type:

BOOT> (restart)

Thanks for the explanation. Our service providers has modified
the configuration of /tmp on our server to provide more space
and the 'svk smerge' command is now working happy apparently
re-creating the Axiom subversion repository on Google in the
expected manner. :-)

At the current rate of upload, I expect the process to take

Good to hear Bill. :-) If everything goes as expected, later we can
discuss how to keep in sync sourceforge and google repositories.
I do not know if the steps you provided me before are still the ones
to use. This is just in case you want me to take care of the maintaining
them in sync.

Alfredo

Hmm, I don't know how to make sense of this (from interp/Makefile):

I have uptdated to build-improvements form 29.09.2006 and tried it
on a few system. On debian sarge i386 and gentoo amd64  build works
both with system gcl and with bundled gcl (using `--without-gcl')
option. On amd64 mandrake 9.2 build works with bundled gcl (did not
try installed gcl). On debian unstable bundled gcl does not build
due to missing msgfmt:

When I modified the Makefile to put the 'compiler::link' form on a
single line I was able to restart the build. Build produced stopped latex
process later, but appearently I got working AXIOMsys.

This is a binutils inside GCL issue.  I don't know what to do about
it.  Maybe modify GCL not to build with intl' support?

Is it possible this might be a shell issue?  It looks to me as if the
mutiline format string isn't being properly interpreted as a string
when passed to GCL.  What shell was that?

I'll eventually get to the latex part.

For the moment, I've "mysteriously broken" my local tree.  I propose

Well, um ... as usual I was too optimistic.

After 24 hours of running:

  svk smerge --baseless --incremental --verbatim --remoterev \
    /mirror/axiom /mirror/google --message="Initial commit" 

where /mirror/axiom is a mirror of the SourceForge repository
and /mirror/google is a mirror of the Google Code repository,

I got this message twice:

...skipping
A   branches/build-improvements/src/input/sregset.input.pamphlet
A   branches/build-improvements/src/input/lump.input.pamphlet
RA layer request failed: PUT of

  improvements/src/input/lump.input.pamphlet': 502 Bad Gateway
  (https://axiom.googlecode.com)
  Please sync mirrored path /google first.
...

I had to restart from scratch because initially I did not (yet)
know about using --incremental.

Then the third time around this time using the incremental option
so that at least something got committed in case it failed again,
at revision 19 I got the error message:

New merge ticket: 54bea96e-1511-0410-8851-aaeae44645fa:/:18
A repository hook failed: MERGE request failed on '/svn':
Commit would put repository over quota limit.

Arrggggh! :-(

The complete svn repository on SourceForge is only 233,248 Kb.
It should have fit on Google!

On axiom-developer.org I can rsync the entire repository from
SourceForge and create a local mirror in about 10 minutes and
everything works fine.

Maybe 'svk smerge' is too brain-dead about the way it recreates
the branches and ends up duplicating more code than in the
original SourceForge repository?

Or maybe we do not actually have 250Mb. available on Google?

Again, not having shell access to Google Code is making this
unnecessarily excruciating. At least I could use svnadmin and
tidy things up. But doing things this way is ridiculous.

Where to go from here?

1) Start over from scratch again!? and this time do what I had
planned originally - just commit trunk, copy trunk to branches
build-improvements, and then commit an up to date version of
build-improvements? I.e. lose all the history?

2) Beg for another 100 Mb. from Google and continue the smerge?

3) Ask someone who does have shell access to Google Code to just
rsync this turkey from SourceForge for us?

What do you think?

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. On a related issue. The more I think about the 'zips'
directory in the Axiom distribution the more I think it was a
ReallyStupid (tm) invention. Why take a source code tarball from
another project (gcl) and stick it into the Axiom repository?
If we really need a copy of gcl, why don't we just add it properly
into the repository as source code? Why do we work around the
capabilities of the source code control system by saving the
tarball and patches against it, having to apply these patches
during the build instead of just committing these patches to
Axiom's version of gcl in the repository? All of this stuff is
stored in the repository in a compressed manner anyway, right?

GNU bash, version 3.1.14(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

AFAICS shell preserve backslashes (since they are inside apostrophes).
I have checked on another Debian machine (this time using bundled gcl)
and the same problem appeared. Both problematic machnes run Gnu make
3.81. The other machines (without this problem) run Gnu make 3.80.

I believe I have run into that problem with one of my own projects. Here =

is my 'svn log' corresponding to it. Maybe that gives some inside.

Cannot you move the \ outside the '...' area.

---My ChangeLog

There was a problem with handling quoted backslash/newline combinations
with a newer version of GNU-make (version 3.81). This came from a recent
bugfix that happened in make 3.81. Here is the corresponding ChangeLog
entry from GNU make 3.81.

Google Guy Here.  :-)

Can you do me a favor?  Can you try using svk to 'push' your
repository to some other local repository (in the same way you're
pushing it at google)?  Then verify that the target (replicated)
repository is indeed the same size as the original?

I *suspect* there's a bug in the quota-tracking code at google, and if
so, it's my fault.  I may need to investigate ASAP!

Yes, this is what I was trying to hint at when you guys initially
asked for a gig of space.  :-)

I don't know :-)
In fact, I would really prefer to avoid the situation where Axiom
maintains its own forks of GCL and noweb.

However, as per the build-improvements branch, I think we no longer
apply patches against the tarballs.

Now, if this is a make bug, then it is really unfortunate. :-(

Sorry that I suggested to rewrite

mytst:
	@echo \
	'(foo  \
	    (bar baz))'

into

mytst:
	@echo \
	'(foo ' \
	'   (bar baz))'

Just put the apostrophes differently.

I'll be quiet next time.

I see your 'reasons' cache has expired again. 
Please refresh it from the mailing list history. :-)

Axiom is NOT the only one to do this and there are prefectly valid
reasons for doing so. Review your version of SVN if you don't
believe me. They include Neon and APR. 

You believe that yum and apt-get work and that they work for
every user. But consider all of the software that got installed
because you needed a couple Perl packages. I believe the number
was in the hundreds. I've run into the same issue trying to
automatically install yum packages. I generally abort the
update if it insists on installing a new version of glibc
when all i wanted was to bring some utility up to date.

And consider what happens when the average user tries to 
update the utility, the update insists on re-installing glibc,
and the user does not have root access.

Plus if you apt-get GCL you might get a version from stable,
unstable, or testing. Yet GCL-2.6.8pre only works on some
systems and GCL-2.6.8pre2 only works on others and there is
no build-time way to distinguish them. Nor is there a tag
so you can't pull from the CVS. I'm waiting to see how this
issue is handled in build-improvements.

Axiom build should 'just work'.

Not, 'just work if you have yum', 'have root access', and
'are willing to install a hundred Perl scripts' or 'know
which CVS tag will work with this axiom version'. Axiom 
can build on Red Flag Linux. As far as I know they don't
have either yum or apt-get (or if they do I don't know the
chinese incantation). Axiom is nearly working on the MAC.
As far as I know there is no yum for the MAC.

Axiom build should 'just work'.

The reason to use the GCL tarball with patches is that gradually
the patches get accepted upstream. If we copied the source tree
into Axiom we would be maintaining our own version which would
eventually get out of sync. A source tarball with patches does
not get out of sync since the patches are obvious.

The fact that the repository is or is not compressed has nothing
to do with the whole issue.




Part of your frustration seems to be coming from SVN. I'm using
SVN in work and it 'locks' the source tree, insists I run 'cleanup'
(which NEVER works), and forces me to unwind changes, blow away my
source tree, refetch the repository, re-apply my changes, and commit.
It is tedious. The whole idea of 'locking' is broken.

I also use SVN on Magnus, one of my other open source projects.
The checkouts regularly fail. I have to do a checkout followed
by at least a half-dozen 'updates' to get a good source tree.
And then commit bombs and I'm forced to try to clean up the
resulting mess using the same dance of 'back-out, blow-away,
checkout, update, update, update, update, update, update,
apply changes, commit and pray.

Darcs is slow but it works. 
Arch is complex but has never failed.
CVS is old but never fails.

SVN is broken. Face it. It's not ready for prime time.
The only hope we have is to host it ourselves so you can
use the admin tools to recover.

Tim --

there exist two implementations of boottran::boottocl:
  1. one in interp/util.lisp,
  2. and on in boot/ptyout.boot.

Which one is the real boottocl compiled into the Boot translator?

I DO NOT know any other project that stores source code tarballs
in their source code repository. Do you?

I did not say that storing gcl source code in the Axiom
repository was necessarily a ReallyBad(tm) thing - just storing
it as a compressed zip file is ReallyBad. Whether Axiom should
be distributing gcl as part of it's source code (as patches or
en mass) is a separate issue.

No they don't work for every user - just 95% of them. The
others either have a unique system of their own choosing or
they have badly screwed something up somehow.

Yes. But it worked. Scary stuff.

You must be one of those in the 5% category. ;)

Different problem. 'pre' mean 'pre-release'. We are lucky that
it runs at all.

!!! Wait until gcl-2.6.8 is released, of course. Nobody should be
distributing pre-release software except in highly experiement
branches.

That's simply unrealistic.

Linux should just work. Windows should just work ... Maple should

All patches are obvious in a source code control system. What is

The point is that storing a binary tarball containing source code
in a source code control system defeats the purpose and makes it
necessary to do things in a more complicated way.

We had previously discussed this long before SVN was ever an issue.

But I agree about SVN. My experience with subversion is all
negative. I have no idea why the "major projects" have chosen
such a monster. But I guess it works for them and there are a
*lot* of people actively developing it and using it.

Darcs seems to get faster with each release. 1.0.7 works very
well for me. It is continuing to be actively developed and
maintained.

Arch fails on windows and has (mostly) been abandoned by it's

As Jurgen Weiss has pointed out, bootsys is technically
superfluous. The boot translator is include in interp as part
of SPAD. And Axiom can be bootstrapped directly from the
version of boot in interp. (This is the method that he used
for the CMUCL version of Axiom.)

So I guess which one is "real" depends on your point of view.

all that is interesting but does not address my real issue.

Assume I have an issue with how boottocl works, which version am I
supposed to modify?  I'm talking of the system as it currently is --
now how it could theoretically be.

Thank you very much for your reply and your suggestion below.

First I created a local backup copy of our SourceForge repository:

  $export RSYNC_PROXY=rsync-svn.sourceforge.net:80
  $mkdir -p ~/test0
  $rsync -v -a rsync-svn-a::svn/axiom/* ~/test0

(This took less that 10 minutes.)

This copy of the repository is 167,364 Kb. Apparently the size of
233,248 Kb that I quoted above was incorrect. Sorry.

  $ du -s /home/page/test0
  167364  /home/page/test0

Then I ran the following test to simulate what I was trying to
do to Google:

  $svnadmin create /home/page/test
  $svk mirror  /mirror/axiom https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom
  $svk mirror /mirror/test file:///home/page/test
  $svk smerge --baseless --incremental --verbatim --remoterev /mirror/axiom
/mirror/test

(This took about 15 minutes on axiom-developer.org.)

Note: I did not use file://home/page/test0 as the source because if
both repositories are local svk uses a short-cut to do the smerge.

No. You are "off the hook" :-)

The size of the resulting repository is 326,332 Kb.

$ ls /home/page/test1
conf  dav  db  format  hooks  locks  README.txt
$ du -s /home/page/test1
326332  /home/page/test

This is nearly twice as large as the original!

So this confirms that 'svk smerge' does not re-create the repository
in the same compact form in which it exists on SourceForge. :-(

Regards,
Bill Page.

at one time the two parsers handled differently languages,
the 'old' boot language and the 'new' boot language. the
boot parser was written in the old boot language and the
rest of the system was coded in the new boot language.
the goal was to unify the two language.

i don't remember whether we fully resolved that issue.
the only way to guarantee they are the same is to verify
that they ultimately call the same functions. or you can
translate each of the boot files with both functions and
see if the resulting lisp code is equal.

one of the parsers used to live in the boottran package
and the other lived in the boot package. there is a subtle
issue of which macros are loaded into each image which
affects the ultimate expansion of the code.

so the ultimate answer is i don't know. its been too long.

It was a rhetorical statement with no basis in fact. I have no
idea if it is true or not or even how to find out. Sorry.

But certainly such general package installation tools as apt-get,
yum, up2date,, pkgadd and fink are very popular among the "boxed
linux" distributions as you can judge by hits on google. And
language specific tools such as cpan for perl have a reputation
for high quality and ease of use. I don't know anyone besides
Tim who has reported such serious problems with these tools.

Bill Page.
