|                      Richard Dimick Jenks                                  |
|           Axiom Developer and Computer Algebra Pioneer                     |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| Richard D. Jenks was born on November 16, 1937 in Dixon, Illinois,         |
| where he grew up. During his childhood he learned to play the organ        |
| and sang in the church choir thereby developing a life-long passion        |
| for music.                                                                 |
|                                                                            |
| He received his PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois at      |
| Urbana-Champaign in 1966. The title of his dissertation was                |
| ``Quadratic Differential Systems for Mathematical Models" and was          |
| written under the supervision of Donald Gilles. After completing his       |
| PhD, he was a post-doctoral fellow at Brookhaven National Laboratory       |
| on Long Island. In 1968 he joined IBM Research where he worked until       |
| his retirement in 2002.                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| At IBM he was a principal architect of the Scratchpad system, one of       |
| the earliest computer algebra systems(1971). Dick always believed that     |
| natural user interfaces were essential and developed a user-friendly       |
| rule-based system for Scratchpad. Although this rule-based approach        |
| was easy to use, as algorithms for computer algebra became more            |
| complicated, he began to understand that an abstract data type             |
| approach would give sophisticated algorithm development considerably       |
| more leverage. In 1977 he began the Axiom development (originally          |
| called Scratchpad II) with the design of MODLISP, a merger of Lisp         |
| with types (modes). In 1980, with the help of many others, he              |
| completed an initial prototype design based on categories and domains      |
| that were intended to be natural for mathematically sophisticated          |
| users.                                                                     |
|                                                                            |
| During this period many researchers in computer algebra visited IBM        |
| Research in Yorktown Heights and contributed to the development of the     |
| Axiom system. All this activity made the computer algebra group at IBM     |
| one of the leading centers for research in this area and Dick was          |
| always there to organize the visits and provide a stimulating and          |
| pleasant working environment for everyone. He had a good perspective       |
| on the most important research directions and worked to attract            |
| world-renowned experts to visit and interact with his group. He was an     |
| ideal manager for whom to work, one who always put the project and the     |
| needs of the group members first. It was a joy to work in such a           |
| vibrant and stimulating environment.                                       |
|                                                                            |
| After many years of development, a decision was made to rename             |
| Scratchpad II to Axiom and to release it as a product. Dick and Robert     |
| Sutor were the primary authors of the book Axiom: The Scientific           |
| Computation System. In the foreword of the book, written by David and      |
| Gregory Chudnovsky, it is stated that ``The Scratchpad system took its     |
| time to blossom into the beautiful Axiom product. There is no rival to     |
| this powerful environment in its scope and, most importantly, in its       |
| structure and organization.'' Axiom was recently made available as         |
| free software. See http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom.              |
|                                                                            |
| Dick was active in service to the computer algebra community as            |
| well. Here are some highlights. He served as Chair of ACM SIGSAM           |
| (1979-81) and Conference Co-chair (with J. A. van Hulzen) of EUROSAM       |
| '84, a precursor of the ISSAC meetings. Dick also had a long period of     |
| service on the editorial board of the Journal of Symbolic                  |
| Computation. At ISSAC '95 in Montreal, Dick was elected to the initial     |
| ISSAC Steering Committee and was elected as the second Chair of the        |
| Committee in 1997. He, along with David Chudnovsky, organized the          |
| highly successful meetings on Computers and Mathematics that were held     |
| at Stanford in 1986 and MIT in 1989.                                       |
|                                                                            |
| Dick had many interests outside of his professional pursuits including     |
| reading, travel, physical fitness, and especially music. Dick was an       |
| accomplished pianist, organist, and vocalist. At one point he was the      |
| organist and choirmaster of the Church of the Holy Communion in            |
| Mahopac, NY. In the 1980s and 1990s, he sang in choral groups under        |
| the direction of Dr. Dennis Keene that performed at Lincoln Center in      |
| New York city.                                                             |
|                                                                            |
| Especially important to him was his family: his eldest son Doug and        |
| his wife Patricia, his son Daniel and his wife Mercedes, a daughter        |
| Susan, his brother Albert and his wife Barbara, his sister Diane           |
| Alabaster and her husband Harold, his grandchildren Douglas, Valerie,      |
| Ryan, and Daniel Richard, and step-granddaughter Danielle. His             |
| longtime companion, Barbara Gatje, shared his love for music,              |
| traveling, Point O'Woods, and life in general.                             |
|                                                                            |
| On December 30, 2003, Dick Jenks died at the age of 66, after an           |
| extended and courageous battle with multiple system                        |
| atrophy. Personally, Dick was warm, generous, and outgoing with many       |
| friends. He will be missed for his technical accomplishments, his          |
| artist talents, and most of all for his positive, gentle, charming         |
| spirit.                                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| Prepared by Bob Caviness, Barry Trager, and Patrizia Gianni with           |
| contributions from Barbara Gatje, James H. Griesmer, Tony Hearn,           |
| Manuel Bronstein, and Erich Kaltofen.                                      |
|                                                                            |

		  The ACM SIGSAM 2009 International
		Workshop on Programming Languages for
		    Mechanized Mathematics Systems
			      PLMMS 2009

		   Munich, Germany; August 21, 2009
		     http://plmms09.cse.tamu.edu/

			   CALL FOR PAPERS


The ACM SIGSAM 2009 International Workshop on Programming Languages
for Mechanized Mathematics Systems will be co-located with TPHOLs 2009.=20

General Information

The scope of this workshop is at the intersection of programming
languages (PL) and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). The latter
category subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS),
interactive proof assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers
(ATP), all heading towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical
assistants. Areas of interest include all aspects of PL and MMS that
meet in the following topics, but not limited to:

  * Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages
    intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both
    algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic
    definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof
    languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming
    languages built into CA systems.=20

  * Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the
    relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For
    instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq
    is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML
    and Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such
    mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities,
    which are rarely available in regular programming languages. How
    can programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without
    limiting mathematics to the computational world view?

  * Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers
    advanced mathematical concepts in programming languages that
    improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type
    systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent
    types are of particular interest here, as is intentionality vs
    extensionality.=20

  * Language elements for program verification: covers specific means
    built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using
    MMS. For example, logical annotations within programs may be
    turned into verification conditions to be solved in a proof
    assistant eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make
    this work conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?

These issues have a very colorful history. Many PL innovations first
appeared in either CA or proof systems first, before migrating into
more mainstream programming languages.  This workshop is an
opportunity  to present the latest innovations in MMS design that may=20
be relevant to future programming languages, or conversely novel PL=20
principles that improve upon implementation and deployment of MMS.=20=20
Why are all the languages of mainstream CA systems untyped?  Why=20
are the (strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than=20
a typical CAS?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?=20=20
What forms of dependent types may be used in mathematical modeling?=20=20
How can MMS regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and
"modularity"?  What are the biggest barriers to using a more
mainstream language as a host language for a CAS or PA/ATP?=20

PLMMS 2007 was held as a satellite event of, and PLMMS 2008 was
a CICM 2008 workshop.

Submission Details

The strategy is to do a depth-first collection of functions and move
them into the interpreter or compiler documents. This is the start
of the second layer of that collection for the top level loop.

Just saw the note on the Maxima list from David Billinghurst about a sourceforge project for Reduce:

http://reduce-algebra.sourceforge.net/

It looks like this may be the (formerly?) commercial REDUCE, based on their history blurb.  If so, it's probably worth calling some attention to - if nothing else as a source for ideas/algorithms.  It's sourceforge page lists the BSD license.

Dear Friends of Jerry Kovacic:

It is with great sadness that I am passing on the news that
Jerry Kovacic died of brain cancer at around 2:30 pm on
April 1, 2009. He was 67.

Jerry is well known for his eponymous algorithm for solving
linear second order differential equations, which was
implemented in Scratchpad (Axiom). His early work in the
late 1960's on the inverse problem for differential Galois
theory paved the way for a complete solution of this
difficult problem. He has been a visiting scholar at the
Department of Mathematics at The City College of The City
University New York since his retirement from a software
company, and he has made significant contributions to a
modernized treatment of differential algebraic geometry. For
the last few years, Jerry was an organizer for the Kolchin
Seminar in Differential Algebra, and until a month ago,
despite his fight with brain cancer, he continued to attend
the Kolchin
Seminar at the Graduate Center, CUNY, and participated in
discussions. 

We will miss him dearly.

Sadly,


William

You can now run a complete Axiom system on native windows.

The approximate steps are:


A) set up an X server on windows:
 1) visit http://gears.aset.psu.edu/hpc/guides/xming
 2) download Xming
 3) install it in windows
 4) launch it

B) download axiom ubuntu image
 1) http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads.html
 2) download ubuntu binary as axiom-ubuntu-nov2008-bin.tgz
 3) move axiom tgz image to C:\

C) set up Portable_Ubuntu on windows:
 1) visit http://lifehacker.com/5195999/portable-ubuntu-runs-ubuntu-inside-windows
 2) download Portable Ubuntu
 3) install it (it created c:\Portable_Ubuntu directory)
 4) cd Portable_Ubuntu
 5) run_portable_ubuntu (its a bat file)

D) enable root access
 1) in the ubuntu menu bar Applications->Terminal
 2) sudo passwd root (the default root passwd is 123456)

E) install axiom into /etc (the only place with room in my install)
 0) su -
 1) cd /etc
 2) tar -zxf /mnt/C/axiom-ubuntu-nov2008-bin.tgz
 3) cd axiom
 4) export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
 5) export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
 6) axiom

For me, axiom starts, hyperdoc pops up, and I can run graphics.

You need to export the DISPLAY variable in portable ubuntu. Do:

So more detailed steps are:

A) set up an X server on windows:
 1) visit http://gears.aset.psu.edu/hpc/guies/xming
 2) download Xming
 3) install it in windows
 4) launch it

B) download axiom ubuntu image
 1) http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads.html
 2) download ubuntu as axiom-ubuntu-nov2008-bin.tgz
 3) move axiom tgz image to C:\

C) set up Portable_Ubuntu on windows

 2) download Portable_Ubuntu
 3) install it (it created c:\Portable_Ubuntu directory)
 4) cd Portable_Ubuntu
 5) run_portable_ubuntu (it is a bat file)

D) enable root access
 1) in the ubuntu menu bar Applications->Accessories->Terminal
 2) sudo passwd root (the default root password is 123456)

D+) find your window IP address
 0) open a windows cmd window
 1) type ipconfig
 2) write down your IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.105) 

E) install axiom into /etc (the only place with room in my install)
 0) su -
 1) cd /etc
 2) tar -zxf /mnt/C/axiom-ubuntu-nov2008-bin.tgz
 3) cd axiom
 4) export DISPLAY=192.168.1.105:0.0 
 5) export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
 6) export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
 7) axiom

+<h1>Axiom on Windows:</h1>
+You can now run Axiom on a Windows box. Basically all Axiom needs

+get a copy of Axiom (Step B), set up ubuntu (Step C), set up
+the minor details (Step D, E), and start Axiom (Step F).
+
+The steps are very simple and are laid out in detail here:

Axiom now has a new )set debug command.

This top level command will collect all of the internal debugging 
flags so that they can be found, become easier to use, and become
better documented.

Lisp is good at manipulating lisp. You can use it to skip over
gensyms and linebreaks, comments, and all kinds of other noise,
including knowing that 'asdf and '|ASDF| are equal.

Here is the algebra check program I use. 
It does not require perl, awk, sed, and other tools.

=======================================================================
;;; check is a lisp-based regression test function that complains if
;;; the newly compiled algebra differs from the reference algebra.
;;;
;;; To use it, just invoke the check function
;;; (Note that the directories are hardcoded since they rarely change)
;;; (Note that you must compile this file due to recursion depth)


;;; In this example, the API and NOTTING domains are new and are not in
;;; the reference algebra. The ASTACK, DEQUEUE, FLOAT, and STACK domains
;;; have added missing functions in the latest release. The 
;;;     --- is the new directory function
;;;     +++ is the reference directory function
;;; check exits on first failure.

well, there are an average of more than 1 post per day over the last

I'm trying to build Axiom from sources on Slackware
(using recent GIT version):

# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/linux
# export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
# make

I get this error after about a year of my tries :-)

## SKIP ##
compiling VECTOR.lsp to VECTOR.o
=====================================
=== algebra bootstrap complete ======
=====================================
make[3]: *** No rule to make target
`/tmp/axiom/mnt/linux/algebra/AHYP.o', needed by `src'.  Stop.
make[3]: Leaving directory `/tmp/axiom/src/algebra'
make[2]: *** [algebradir] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/tmp/axiom/src'
make[1]: *** [srcdir] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/axiom'
make: *** [all] Error 2


===========================================================
As far as I know, the issue is this rule in file "src/algebra/Makefile":
${OUT}/%.o: ${MID}/%.nrlib/code.o
	@ echo copying $*.nrlib to $*.o
	@ cp ${MID}/$*.nrlib/code.o ${OUT}/$*.

I think so because when I remove "${MID}/%.nrlib/code.o",
'make' finds this rule but, of cause,
fails not finding "${MID}/AHYP.nrlib/code.o"

Also in some my project I had similar trouble trying
to connect a target in one directory with a prerequisite in another.

Looking at other linux distributions (Debian, ALT-Linux), I
found there are no such problems and no specific patches.


==========================================================
I'm using:
Slackware 12.2.0
GNU Make 3.81
GNU Awk 3.1.6

Build log is very long and starts with:

Igor,

slackware is not one of the platforms I have in my build list
so I don't guarantee it will work there....

I will build a slackware machine and see if I can reproduce your problem.

No idea what this can be.  I have been building Axiom on Slackware for years and
have never had a problem.  A fresh Git checkout seems to progress well for me
(on Slackware 12.1.0).  This almost looks like lack of disk space perhaps, or
some other local idiosyncrasy.

Hans,

re: DESTDIR documentation, I agree and I will document it better.

By the way, your mailer sends out a UUENCODED-html document rather
than ASCII text so your message arrives as a block, which UUDECODES
to html.

One of the fundamental problems with forking is that people can be
confused about the original projects and the forks. It is important
that this does not happen. The Axiom project is the original project.
OpenAxiom is a fork started around the September 2007 time frame.

Could you post the error on http://savannah.nongnu.org/mail/?group=3Daxiom
mailing list? I'd be happy to fix the problem if I knew what it might
be.

Right and that is clearly stated on

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AboutAxiom

It is a bit hard to clearly describe differences between the forks, 
because for the end user it is currently nearly invisible.

People should look at the respective websites of the original Axiom 
project and the forks or ask at the respective developers lists.

Ralf,

I'm not sure that this is true anymore.

Axiom has been concentrating heavily on documentation and the
results are visible primarily to the end user. 

Axiom now has approximate 300 help files, 250 of which are algebra.
These are listed from the )help command.

Axiom now has examples for thousands of functions, so when a user does
  )d op map
he sees examples, such as:

  Examples of map from StreamFunctions2
  m:=[i for i in 1..]
  f(i:PositiveInteger):PositiveInteger==i**2
  map(f,m)

Axiom now has 19 documents defined, of which 9 are fully populated
and are being expanded continuously. All of the documentation is
hyperlinked for easy navigation. There is a combined table of contents.

Axiom has several full graphs of the algebra in various forms so
a user can navigate the graph and hyperlink directly into the 
document containing the associated algebra.

Axiom has one video on youtube which has been viewed 1168 times.
A second one is "in process" to be released shortly.
A whole series is planned.

Axiom has included a new
  )set debug
command that will expose various debugging tools to the end user.

Axiom's website focus is on end user issues, including building
easy-to-download binaries.

Axiom has a new firefox browser front end that incorporates about
80 percent of the existing hyperdoc pages as well as dozens of
new content pages.

All of these changes are end-user visible, and only on Axiom.
I think the end user can see these differences directly.

Tim

Fix the system build so it no longer requires egrep, 
as reported by a Igor.

Igor, the slackware build is in process but I probably won't have a
binary available until the weekend as I have a business trip.

As I understand it, you could easily prevent forking by pushing Axiom to
user more actively, it could have the functionality of OpenAxiom or FriCAS,
but it has lost the momentum. From user point of view the confusion is
of no importance as long as one of forks works and another one does not.

Aleksej,

As I understand it, one fundamental difference between OpenAxiom and Axiom
lies in the project goals related to the boot language. Approximately half
of the Axiom internals is written directly in common lisp. The other half
is written in a "syntactic sugar language", called boot, which compiles to
common lisp.

The Axiom project had, since it was released as open source, the
stated goal of removing the boot language code. Indeed, this was a
goal I had while working on Axiom before it was ever released from IBM
in the late 80s.

The OpenAxiom project has the exact opposite goal of writing everything
in boot and developing boot as a language.

Given that the goals of OpenAxiom are directly opposed to the stated
project goals of Axiom, how do you see that this difference should be
resolved?

Tim

Tim is almost right -- OpenAxiom aims to move away from Lisp as implementation
language.  That goal of OpenAxiom is in line with the original AXIOM project
(which led to A#, then Aldor).  I have it from first hand the original project
wasn't meant to be written entirely in Lisp.  However, that was an issue of
occasional debate.  I suspect that will continue for the foreseeable future.
By the way, the Boot in OpenAxiom is inaccurately described as
a syntactic sugar for Common Lisp.

As Dick Jenks explained it to me when I joined the Axiom project in 1984,
the Boot language was intended as a boot-strap step to eventually implement
the entire system in the Spad language.  The idea was first to convert to a
language that was syntactically similar to Spad, then convert it to actually
use Spad.  Of course the second step never happened.  That's why the
language was named Boot.
While Boot does have the semantics of Lisp, to me, the distinguishing
feature is it's very nice syntax for list pattern matching.  You can do the
same things in Lisp, but the syntactic elegance of Boot for pattern matching
is undeniable.  It was so nice that we got away without real structured data
throughout the entire project.  I love the syntax:

Yes, and Dick was one of the authors of the Boot language.
Dick also used Meta, another language which has since been removed.




Boot's lack of data structures causes obscurity

The lack of structured data is the cause of so MANY of the random
$-variables with undescribed contents. I am trying to untangle the
contents of the Frame structure so I can explain it. I'm trying to
collect and manage the global state scattered in hundreds of $-variables.

There is a general )set data structure hidden in |$setOptions|
which could easily be a domain-specific language (DSL) if implemented
in lisp. I will eventually write a simple DSL to make this data structure
obvious and trivial to extend and maintain. But boot makes it impossible
to use these structures or DSLs, making the whole subsystem obscure.





Boot needlessly complicates the build process

Since boot was written in boot we had a situation where we needed a
running Axiom in order to build Axiom. This was also true of the
algebra in that you needed a running system to build a running system.
That was fine at IBM as we always had a running Axiom.

While we worked together at IBM I created a version of Scratchpad
that was a pure lisp implementation. It greatly simplified the build
process since we didn't need to build Meta or Boot. But Dick was quite
pleased with the "recursively defined" aspects and hated lisp syntax.
Thus, my pure lisp version died, greatly complicating my build work.
(Indeed, that's why there are .clisp, .lsp, and .lisp files in int.)

When the system was released to me I did not have permission to
distribute NAG's system and therefore did not have a way to bootstrap.
I needed to rearchitect the system so boot and the algebra could be
built without a running system. It took nearly a year of work to 
construct a version of Axiom that builds from scratch. Boot made 
part of that process painful.

This whole process makes the system build needlessly complicated.  One
of the CLEARLY STATED GOALS of the free version of Axiom was the goal
of rewriting boot into lisp and removing boot from the world.





Boot is a bad idea.

Boot adds nothing to the system but python-like syntax. We might as
well retarget boot to BE python-compatible so we would have people who
knew the language. There are NO active Axiom developers who have
developed new code in boot. Boot is a dead language, specified only by
its single implementation. It is not even a complete language as there
are many things implemented directly in lisp that you can't say in
boot. It is a syntactic-sugar, restricted subset of a real language.

Boot is yet-another-of-the-thousands of lisp-without-parens languages.
Every one of these lisp-without-parens languages misses the
fundamental point of the parens, which is that programs are data.

Boot takes away the source of the immense power of lisp to self-modify.
Boot takes away lisp's ability to build domain-specific languages in macros.
Boot takes away CLOS, data structures, and other tools.
Boot takes away "to the metal" optimizations.
Boot takes away the ability to debug in the language you write.

You add a boot-to-lisp translation which requires code to maintain.
You add a boot-to-lisp translation which complicates the build process.
You add a boot language which requires documentation and explanations.
You maintain an unspecified language nobody speaks.

Why?





The Common Lisp future of Axiom

Once boot goes away then Makefiles go away since I can use lisp to
build lisp.  The whole build process becomes....

  fire up a lisp image
  load code
  execute

(Well, there is noweb but Axiom can now read TeX files with tex-chunks
so noweb will disappear as soon as I finish removing boot. Thus the
sources will be literate lisp files as pure latex readable by Axiom)

So Axiom will be very simple to build and rather more simple to
understand since I'm literate documenting it as I go.  Axiom will be
easier to maintain since Common Lisp is a language with a published
standard used by people.

Back in the late 80s I set out to remove boot from Axiom.
It is a clearly stated goal of the Axiom project.
It is happening as I write this.

Alright, now that becomes more clear. What is common between Axiom and
OpenAxiom then? Do they implement the same high level language?
Do they have the same mathematical library?

> Given that the goals of OpenAxiom are directly opposed to the stated

I repeat, that from user point of view the difference between projects
is that one builds and another does not. While I can build FriCAS and
OpenAxiom, I cannot boast it with Axiom. And the impression from my side
is that you handle build problems ad hoc (cf. Slackware build problems):
each linux-based system gets its own configuration file with quite
uncommon content.

What should be done, if I happen to need Axiom on HP-UX, is unknown.

At the same time FriCAS and OpenAxiom use portable Common Lisp
implementations (GCL is far from being portable), they are packager
friendly (they don't ship bundled publicly accessible software),
and they use well-established configure-make build process.

I remember you stated "it should simply work" as one of arguments in
favour of shipping gcl and other software bundled. In practice it works
quite the opposite way: I have to patch CLISP in order to make it not
fail on fragile shell code, I have to patch ECL in order to install
libraries properly on Darwin, I have to patch noweb in order to make it
behave (it uses hardcoded prefix and wrong icon program). Sometimes
these patches are done by other people and look magic to me. All these
customizations are to be reused, but Axiom doesn't do that.

In short Axiom doesn't build and doesn't play nice, when I'm going to
fix build problems myself.

And from my user point of view, Axiom should adopt either FriCAS' or
OpenAxiom's build system, whatever is closer, or develop similar one,
if Axiom is meant to be used by non-programmers. I believe you know
that there're enough engineers who are not and do not wish to be
programmers or system administrators.

Note, that I'm not interested in your political agenda, like to Boot or
not to Boot, or to tangle or not to tangle. I'm interested in real world
applications, those used by real life engineers, researchers or students.
As for now I can offer them OpenAxiom and FriCAS, but not Axiom, because
of severe maintainance problems. I'd like to change that but it seems to
contradict your political views, and I'm not ready to maintain substantial
patches.

Dear Timothy

Frankly I think it would be better to use the shared lib by default.
Don't know what you think but a lot of distributions ship only the
shared lib and I would be surprised if that will not continue.

Regards,

Greg

I couldn't agree more.   I think Boot was a real master piece --
just look at the size of the parser and translator.  Yes, definitely
the pattern matching syntax is really nice.

A while ago, I rewrote Axiom's build system to use Autoconf
and restructured the Makefiles so that people -- most of the time
-- just say

     configure && make && make install

That work is in the build-improvements branch.
That is the branch that both OpenAxiom and FriCAS use
as common basis.  The work is still there for Axiom
to benefit from.

A data point: OpenAxiom has more codes written in Boot than any
other in the AXIOM-family.  Yet, it does not need a running
OpenAxiom system to build the entire compiler.

I suspect we had this sort of discussion before...

I actually sent that email prematurely last night, hence it ended with a
colon.
I said that Boot's pattern matching allowed us to get by without structured
data for the whole project.  I meant to follow that up, with "but that's not
a good thing."  The interpreter exposes it's internal representation in a
very bad way.  If you want to change the data structures the interpreter
uses, you need to find all the places in the code which use pattern matching
to destruct data, and change them.  I did this several times and it is no
fun at all.

Any modern language uses structured data to hide those sorts of
implementation details.  Tim's project to rewrite the system in CL is a very
good thing if he replaces Boot pattern matching with structured data.  The
important issue is hiding implementation details.  To me the language used
is secondary.  If Tim wants to use CL, that's fine with me.  If other
projects do the same thing with Boot, that would be good too.

Tim's point about the heavy use of global variables in Boot is a valid
point.  That makes the code hard to understand and change.  But to me that's
not a language issue, but an implementation choice.  Any good rewrite of the
interpreter would remove those.  That could be done in Boot or CL.  If Tim
likes CL, and he does that work to add structured data, I think Axiom would
be much easier to maintain.

You can find the libXpm libraries online. Don't use the sources I
provide. I thought I was being helpful and saving some effort by
caching the sources locally. 

libXpm is used to display pixmaps.  This functionality is part of the
graphics subsystem.  If you feel that you would rather simply rewrite
the code to not use the libXpm package or use the shared library, I'd
be happy to include your diff-Naur patch.

I'm in the process of rewriting graphics to use Firefox canvas
elements.  Axiom's Firefox front end does not use X at all so the
problem won't exist eventually.

You have the sources. Do
  diff -r --brief axiom openaxiom
and you'll see that they are almost nowhere the same.

No. Almost, but no. And that changes more every week.

I scan the commit logs of both FriCAS and OpenAxiom to pick up
changes.  You'll see Waldek mentioned in several Axiom patches from
FriCAS.  Those are patches that Waldek wrote for FriCAS that I
understood enough to apply. If I can't understand the reason for a
change then I can't pick up the change.

Axiom has algebra changes. I do not see the same patches being
applied to OpenAxiom or FriCAS.

You clearly believe that Axiom should adopt the "standard autoconf"
method of building. 

I clearly believe that Makefiles should go away. I believe I will
be able to build Axiom in a portable, unified way using only 
Common Lisp, Latex, and a browser. I'm 

 * rewriting system-dependent subsystems like hyperdoc and graphics
   into Firefox, thus we don't need libXpm
 * simplifying the internals like removing boot so we don't need to
   depend on pre-stages to build, thus we don't need Makefiles
 * unifying the concepts so that Axiom reads and understand latex-style 
   chunks, thus we don't need noweb
 * documenting everything using latex books, thus we don't need hundreds
   of tiny .h, .c, .boot, .lisp, and other 1960s development techniques

Axiom is about 1 million "things of code". It used to exist in thousands
of files, in dozens of subdirectories, with multiple system prerequisites
and complicated dependencies between the code parts. Autoconf is the
"right way" to manage that pile. That's a 1990s "solution" to a 1960
constraint of 4k memory limitations. Believe me, I was there.

Axiom will eventually be 30 books written in Latex and Common Lisp.
You will need a Latex and a standard Common Lisp and a standard browser.

For the moment, as a temporary measure, things that will go away like
GCL's snapshots, noweb, or libXpm are "supported" in "ad-hoc" ways.

FriCAS made the same points. The "30 year horizon" and the "noweb/gclweb"
issues were the fundamental reason why that fork happened.

You strongly disagree with Axiom's project goals.
Thus I think you might consider not using Axiom at all.

Greg,

I did consider using the shared library but was unable to make it work.
There appears to be some sort of versioning issue I don't understand.
If you can figure it out and post a patch, I'll include it.

Hi,

Actually, a patch for this problem was posted a year ago (and even long before
counting the build-improvements branch).  I was (mistakenly) under the
impression it was applied:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2008-05/msg00000.html

LDF should likely be set as in the link above so that either the static or
dynamic lib can be used (preference to shared libs IIRC):

   LDF=" -L${XLIB} -lXpm"


Take care,
Steve

Steven, Igor,

I MAY BE WRONG, but as I recall, when I applied that patch it failed
to build on several systems.

Did either of you test it? How? On what system does it work?

As Stephen mentioned, a patch was applied to
build-improvements -- picked up by both OpenAxiom
and FriCAS.  And as far as I can tell, it works on the many
platforms those systems build.  Solution?  Don't hardcode
XLIB.  Get it deduced for you for free by tools that are
specifically designed to solve that kind of problem.
Stephen';s suggestion is correct for 99.9% of the platforms.

Gaby,

Sigh.

I await your diff-Naur patch for autoconf builds of the Axiom trunk.
If you recall, I've asked for this since you first did autoconf.
That never happened. Please include the patch with your next autoconf
advertisement.

You'll admit that autoconf would have failed if libXpm was not in the
list of things to check. Exactly this kind of failure happpened with
egrep last week. FriCAS, as I recall, did NOT use autoconf to fix it.



Do we really need to relive the whole debate? I certainly don't. 
If people think autoconf is vital, there are now alternatives.
It seems like a "solved problem" to me. 



Can we please stick to the simple question at hand, which is,
did anyone actually TEST the patch and confirm that it works on slackware?
It seems like a standard of public programming to actually test a patch.

And, if the fix is so trivial, did anyone consider simply (re-)posting the
patch rather than open a diatribe about how Axiom fails everywhere?
I don't remember a public crucifiction of FriCAS for the egrep bug
despite the fact that autoconf can detect it but did not.

All systems have bugs.
Find it, fix it, TEST it, post the fix, move on.

Tim

Well, I'm not advertising anything.  You asked for solution; I
suggested one that works -- which others beside me
have been using (e.g. FriCAS).  You are very welcome to dismiss
it under the name of diff --Naur or whatever.  The work is the
in the build-improvements branch; you are of course entirely
entitled to dismiss it -- it only appears curious that you would
complain of missing patch.

Everybody has his/her theology.  Putting aside the fact that I do
not see what egrep has to do with libXpm.so, I would have
reused AC_PROG_EGREP if the issue was reported to me.
But, by no means I do not claim it is superior to solutions that
do not exist yet.   It certainly solves the problem in a very scalable
way -- I do not need to keep a personal list of which platforms
has the right grep.  I just know the Autoconf macro has
been tested by thousands of thousands of system builders, thousands
of thousands times.  So, I do not need to reinvent my own
surely inferior hack.

I'm sorry for having -- for a second -- thought you were genuinely
looking for solution that has been tested to work (the Xpm problem).

Please, continue your regularly scheduled work and ignore
my suggestion (which Stephen reproduced) that happens to work
for OpenAxiom and FriCAS in the real world on real systems
(including the one you are talking about.)

Gaby,

So far I've discussed the problem on and off list.
I've searched for the libXpm.a for slackware.
I've found, built, tested, and then tar-gziped the sources.
I've posted the result and updated the faq.
I've set up a new machine with a slackware 12.2 image.
I am planning to add slackware, like I did vector, to the supported systems.
I am rebuilding all of the currently supported systems to test the patch.

All I asked was, did anyone test the patch.
My recollection, possibly wrong, was that the patch failed for some systems.
Please test an Axiom build on slackware and let me know if it works for you.

This hardly constitutes ignoring the problem.
It does constitute ignoring autoconf, which was not the posted patch.

Please try to stay on topic.

Tim

Yes.  It succeeds on one , and failed on another one -- the one it failed
one was one you did not anticipate (a 64-bit machine that has its
libs in a slightly different place) in the long list of special Makefiles.

Oh, don't worry; I'm staying on topic -- I'm just going to refrain
from suggesting anything that might look like a scalable solution
that has actually been tested and known to work everywhere
we know of.

So.... openSUSE 32 bit worked. openSUSE 64 did not. 
Ok, I'll do an openSUSE 64 build.

I'm not going to do any work, that is rejected before planning stage.
It is a mere waste of time, I'm not going to live forever or wait forever,
even 5 years is too much.

Which is asking for maintainance nightmare, since:
a) Firefox doesn't work everywhere where libXpm works;
b) Firefox is harder to fix.

"Standard browser." Does it mean, it will work in Lynx? w3m? Which one?

While I agree with some points, other points are simply asking for nightmare.
Autoconf may be bad, but what is there now is even worse. And what is going
to be is hardly any better.

Again, my points:

1. Axiom doesn't work.
- Because Axiom is bound to GCL (which is a piece of s... that doesn't work,
contrary to libXpm and autoconf).
- Because Axiom's build system is maintained ad hoc, even to build it
on another linux distribution you need to contact the author and wait
until he sets up another system.

2. Axiom relies on bundled software to build, which is maintainance
nightmare already.

3. Some goals, like depending on Firefox, are asking for maintainance nightmare.

>From user point of view, you have little understanding of real user needs,
even those, who are ready to try little known CAS.

To port FriCAS and OpenAxiom to Dragonfly the only thing I had to change
was OS name pattern, "*bsd*" to "*bsd*|*dragonfly*" in autoconf script.

To build OpenAxiom on FreeBSD I had to dig out some minor differences in pty
headers and libraries, with help from Gabriel I made it. Graphics (libXpm)
worked fine right off the box.

At the same time I had Firefox broken for about a year, and heard similar
complains even from Ubuntu users (thanks to Firefox' sensitivity to libraries).

_That_ is real experience.

...[snip]...

Axiom is a long term project. The theme is the 30 year horizon.  The
point is to make the code live despite the fact that the authors are
dead.  Just two weeks ago we lost yet another Axiom contributor.

A great deal of thought went into the design decisions and project goals.  
All of those thoughts have been documented many times in this forum.

...[snip]...

What is there now is being simplified with each iteration.
A large number of Makefiles are gone. Whole subdirectories are gone.
The whole Makefile superstructure will disappear.
Code is being re-structured, refactored, and documented.
End user documentation is improving with each release.





Exactly the points you raise are the reason FriCAS exists.
FriCAS developers removed the literate form of files in many cases.
FriCAS developers use autoconf and traditional code handling.
FriCAS developers "want it now", not 30 years from now.

If you REALLY want it now, I suggest you switch to Sage.
Sage is moving very fast, builds everywhere with a single "make",
(although not autoconf), has a huge number of active authors,
and is released every week or so. They don't want lisp at all.
But they bundle everything under the sun.




I applaud your desire to use a computer algebra system.
However, the project goals of Axiom clearly don't meet your needs.

<begin indignation rant>

P.S. As for that "piece of shit" GCL.... GCL was developed under
contract to IBM specifically for Axiom. I'm one of its (minor)
authors.  Bill Schelter, the author, was one of the finest programmers
I've known.  His death in 2000 is what caused me to call NAG about
Axiom.  What body of work have you personally authored that so
outshines GCL that you feel qualified to disparage Bill's work? What
body of patches have you submitted to GCL that improves it?  His code
is still used 9 years after his death and generates more efficient
code for Axiom than any other lisp distribution.

Bill sat at my office desk when he visited IBM to work. I once saw him
complain about something Emacs did that was failing. He stopped work,
downloaded the Emacs sources, found the problem, rebuilt Emacs, tested
it, posted a patch, and went back to the GCL task. He has patches in
Emacs, written, tested, and posted in the late 80s. He did open source
work before anyone knew what it was, quietly, efficiently, and correctly.

Bill is unable to defend himself against your remarks but I am.

You seem to be stopped by trivial build problems. 
You refuse to consider posting even minor patches. 
You feel qualified to disparage work you don't personally understand.  
You feel that wasting your time to help other people is a bad tradeoff. 
You feel that the project goals should be redefined to suit your opinions. 
You have no sense of vision beyond your own wants and needs. 
Frankly, I'm not as impressed with you as you seem to be with yourself.

Be that as it may, the Axiom mailing list is NOT the place to lightly
disparage Bill's work. He was a great programmer and I feel a need to
defend his reputation.

On slackware 12.2 I applied your patch to use the Xpm shared library.
I built Axiom from scratch using the shared library.
When I started Axiom the Hyperdoc browser shows a blank page.

I downloaded and built the libXpm.a from the sources I posted.
I rebuilt Axiom from scratch using the static library.
When I started Axiom the Hyperdoc browser works normally.
Graphics also works.

My recommendation is that you build using the libXpm.a on slackware.

Tim

Any other active developer to stay when we lose you?
Judging from commit messages you're the single developer.

Sure, but who are other developers who share most of your views?
Who is going to fix bugs and to develop Axiom (pretty little used) after you die?

Does Axiom build with CLISP or ECL on NetBSD as is right now?
It is 15 to 25% of all BSD users by different estimations.

Do you know any impressions of Sage by real people? All those I know

This is simply delusion. I object several points of Axiom, which proved
to be wrong in practice, and you declare "project goals ... don't meet."

Was you ever told that you're idealist? that you live in ivory tower?
Honestly, this is the impression of you. I don't talk about your
professional skills those you start complaining of, I only assert that
you seem to lack understanding of target audience needs.

I have no time to fix "trivial" build problems. You made them not so
trivial, as do other developers.

I do not have much time to invest into problems that should be solved already,
exactly those problems that all other active "PanAxiom" developers consider
to be solved at the first place.

I'm trained to understand real world, I am not a mathematician.

Who told you that? How many people did you help lately?

This opinion is based on real world experience. If you have facts to
support your views bring them here.

Like anyone attacks Bill at all.

Look, it is 2009 now, not 1989. GCL is outdated, not quite standard,
the least portable of all open source Common Lisp implementations,
one of the least supported ones too. Until quite recently, noone
answered messages on GCL lists for two years at least. Most projects
have time schedule shorter.

What of these has to do with Bill?
He died in 2000 by your own words, but everything of mentioned above
happens after.

And there're many things that changed in the real world in that time
since 2000: we saw significant glibc changes, we saw significant changes
in NetBSD and FreeBSD projects, which brought them to desktop usage,
same happens to Solaris as we talk now. How is it reflected in GCL releases?
When did the last one happen? 2004? I don't even remember now.

You accuse me in disparaging Bill's work as if he died last week.
Now come and charge me with AI winter of 70s. Get real, wake up.

All I say is that project goals should be adjusted if you want to
receive any acceptance outside yourself and (maybe your) friends.
You have some really nice ideas, but other ones are simply awful.

This is a half-lie.  In many instances a substantial amount of
"literal" (i.e., LaTeX) documentation was added to FriCAS.  I do not
know whether Axiom or OpenAxiom picked it up, but I do know that I
wrote this documentation.

It is true however that FriCAS uses LaTeX only for the mathematical
part of the code, i.e., the spad files.

Hi Tim,

Too strange! ;) Works fine for me on Slackware 12.1.0, which uses the same xpm
library version as 12.2.0.  I have also been using this patch on slackware
distros back to versions which provided a static lib.

This seems doubly strange in that linking the dynamic lib works for other
distros (the fedora 10 makefile, for example).

Perhaps when I upgrade a slackware machine I will revisit this issue.

Take care,
Steve

This is the case for OpenAxiom.

Ok. It is entirely possible I made some mistake.
I'll nuke the slackware install and rebuild it from scratch.
This time I'll install everything and see if that changes the behavior.

I've uploaded the binary for slackware (static library version, it will
take me a while to construct the shared library version again).
Could you please test it on your machine?

Hi Tim,

I upgraded to 12.2.0.  The binary works fine on the new 12.2.0 -- but I am
confused:

   > ldd axiom/mnt/slackware/bin/hypertex
     ...
     libXpm.so.4 => /usr/lib/libXpm.so.4 (0xb7f75000)
     ...

   > objdump -x axiom/mnt/slackware/bin/hypertex | grep Xpm
       NEEDED                libXpm.so.4
     00000000        F *UND*  00000000              XpmWriteFileFromImage
     00000000        F *UND*  00000000              XpmReadFileToImage

Looks like everything was built using a shared libXpm.

I will let you know how my local build finishes up.


Take care,
Steve

Tim,

Well, the binary does have a problem.  Looks like GCL was built with a bad path
perhaps?  For example:

  (1) -> )fin
  BOOT> (defun foo ())

  FOO

  BOOT>(compile 'foo)
  cc1: error: /root/axiom/mnt/slackware/bin/..h: Permission denied

  Correctable error: (SYSTEM "gcc -c -Wall -DVOL=volatile -fsigned-char -pipe
  -I/root/axiom/mnt/slackware/bin/../h -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer
  -c \"/tmp/gazonk4.c\" -o \"/tmp/gazonk4.o\" -q") returned a non-zero value 0.

Regardless, a fresh build is clearly in order.

Take care,
Steve

Well, just for superstition I did a rebuild of Axiom using shared
libraries before I did a complete slackware install. The Hyperdoc
home page still showed up blank.

Next I completely reformatted the machine, did a slackware install
but this time I let it install everything from the DVD (4.2 Gigs),
refetched Axiom sources, added your patch, and did an Axiom build.

This one appears to work with the shared library.
Please test it on your install:

http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads/axiom-slackware-mar2009-bin.tgz

I'll rebuild all of the other platforms and see if or where it succeeds.

Tim

This is new behavior and clearly a bug.
I've added it to the bug list as bug 7191.

Personally, that's one of the things I admire about Tim and the Axiom project - idealism.

I don't presume to speak for Tim or the Axiom project, but I always had the impression that the goal was to CREATE the target audience - to reshape the approach the world takes to computer algebra and this type of software, using Axiom to lead by example.  In my opinion, this is something to be respected.  There is of course a risk that this type of experiment will not succeed in attracting the support required for long term viability, but I personally don't see that as a reason to avoid performing the experiment.  In any case, the literate nature of the work should help preserve its value for the long term, by making it easier for someone else to use the knowledge embodied in Axiom.

If you look into the email archives around the time of the forks, you will see that the arguments at the time sound similar to the points you are raising now.  The forks were not undertaken lightly.  The goals of OpenAxiom and Fricas (as I understand it, the project devs of course can speak to this much better) are very much along the more immediately practical lines you are suggesting.  I certainly recommend both projects - I have a great deal of respect for the teams working on them.  They have been and are making exciting progress.

Looks like it has been an issue before.  See the short thread starting at:

 http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2007-10/msg00010.html

A brief read of the GCL docs concerning si:*lib-directory* and
si:*system-directory* indicate to me that one course of action would be to set
si:*system-directory* to the value of $AXIOM/bin at runtime, instead of at build
time as currently done in interp/Makefile.pamphlet in the savesys stanza:

   @ echo '#+:akcl (setq si::*system-directory* "${SPAD}/bin/")' \
               >> ${OUT}/makeint.lisp

For example, the following works:

  (1) -> )fin
  BOOT>(defun foo ())

  FOO

  BOOT>(setq si::*system-directory*
             (concatenate 'string (getenv "AXIOM") "/bin"))

  "/home/steve/tmp/axiom/mnt/slackware/bin"

  BOOT>(compile 'foo)

  #<compiled-function FOO>

Perhaps extending boot::restart with logic similar to the above is a reasonable
path forward?

Take care,
Steve

Looks good here, aside from the system-directory issue.

In addition, my local build on 12.2.0 finished and seems fine.

Take care,

Thanks for the test and the bug fix for directories.
That fix is queued behind 2 other changes in the change queue.

Michael,

Thanks. I can reproduce that. Its a missing script and I'll add it.

You can put this in your $AXIOM/lib subdirectory, do a chmod +x SPADEDIT
and it will work:

=====================================================================
#!/bin/sh
# this script is invoked by the spad )edit command
# can be replaced by users favorite editor
# optional second argument should be character offset in file

thefile=$1
if [ ! -f $1 ] ; then 
  thefile=$AXIOM/../../src/algebra/$1
else
  thefile=$1
fi


if [ $# = 2 ] ; then
	START=`grep -n \^$2\( $thefile | awk -F: '{print $1}'`
else
	START=1
fi

if [ ! "$EDITOR" ] ; then
	EDITOR=vi
fi

if [ "$DISPLAY" ] ; then
	if [ "$EDITOR" = "emacs" ] ; then
		emacs  +$START $thefile &
	elif [ "$EDITOR" = "vi" ] ; then
		xterm -e vi +$START $thefile &
        else
		xterm -e $EDITOR $thefile &
	fi
else
	$EDITOR $thefile
fi

David Gelernter made several observations about the way we currently
are limited by the desktop metaphor. These have a bearing on my thoughts
about the Crystal interface, which were recorded in bookvol12: Axiom Crystal

 \chapter{Axiom Crystal Design}
+\section{Book presentation}
+In the book "Science at the Edge" by John Brockman
+(ISBN 978-1-4027-5450-0),
+in the chapter "The second coming -- A manifesto" by David Gelernter,
+David talks about the way we interact with computers. This has some
+bearing on the crystal notion.
+
+\subsection{Book spines}
+David points out that we currently have a "desktop metaphor" which
+allows us to view our computer interactions as though we were moving
+things around on a desktop, typically folders and documents. There are
+several limitations of this metaphor.
+
+The first is that there is a limited amount of space on the desktop.
+He proposes the idea of a landscape where the computer is just a moving
+window. This gives much more real estate to hold information.
+
+The lack of desktop space leads to the icon idea to capture a small
+representation of a document or folder. There are limitations to how
+representative such a tiny image can be of the original. A book spine
+is an excellent representation of the contents of a book but a tiny
+picture of a folder, not so much.
+
+If I look at this idea in terms of the Crystal concept I can
+see two parallels. The first idea (desktop/icon) vs (landscape/book)
+is related to the organization of Axiom. There is an ongoing effort
+to organize the whole of the system into some small number of books.
+The whole system is then somewhat similar to an encyclopedia where
+there is a shelf of related information. 
+
+Currently the algebra books are on the order of 5000 pages of raw
+material. They will likely grow many times that size as literate
+information is added. One website representation would show the
+Axiom books as book-spines where the algebra section could be
+broken up (visually, not actually) as encyclopedia-like images.
+Thus, you would find the algebra "books" from A-C, D-F, etc.
+
+\subsection{Linking information}
+
+A second idea from the book is the limitations of the hierarchical
+file system idea. Why does a particular file have to have a name?
+Why does a particular file only live in one folder?
+
+For the first question, he comments that if you had 3 dogs it is reasonable
+to name them. But if you have 10,000 cows it probably is not. Some
+information can be anonymous.
+
+For the second question, he asks why doesn't a folder "grab" the 
+information so that a particular file might not reside in multiple
+folders. Unix has this idea embodied in links but Windows doesn't
+support the idea.
+
+He suggests that it might be reasonable to have the folders be active
+so that a particular piece of information, say a travel receipt, might
+be "grabbed" by the taxes folder and the travel expense folder.
+
+Crystal's view of this is somewhat different. Information isn't named.
+It resides in "the problem" floating in space. The naming of information
+is related to the view. 
+
+So if we take a problem in space, say all of your financial information
+and wrap a crystal around it we can view it in multiple ways, each of
+which represents a "facet". Moving between these views corresponds to
+rotating the crystal to view "the problem" through a different facet.
+
+So, in a financial crystal, you might have a taxes facet, a travel
+expense facet, an assets facet, a checkbook facet, etc. A travel
+receipt from a business trip which was added to "the problem' would
+show up in all of these facets in different ways. It is up to the
+facet to organize this piece of information into its proper place

OK. this is bug 7195

It is unusual for the interpreter to exit this way.
It usually will happen if there has already been at least one other

A new Bezier package has been added. It does linear, quadratic, and

+A linear Bezier curve is a simple interpolation between the 
+starting point and the ending point based on a parameter t.
+
+Given a start point a=[x1,y1] and an endpoint b=[x2,y2]

If I do:
)set system functioncode on
)set system optimization on
)set function compile off
draw(surface(x,x*x,y),x=0..5,z=0..3)

I get the failure
  >>System error:
  The variable |y| is unbound.

So clearly, in the highly optimized compiler code, this variable
is freely referenced and unbound at run time causing the segmentation
violation. Turning compilation off can catch it.

X-List-Received-Date: Wed, 15 Apr 2009 15:30:54 -0000

This is mostly more documentation. It is the first step toward
cleaning up and making the interpreter documentation minimally readable.

Add \defunsec latex macro which allows section titles to be displayed
for each defun.

Add section titles to many sections.
Add doc strings to defun sexpressions

Additionally, minor regression breakage due to the new Bezier package
was fixed.

There was a hole in regression testing. If the regression tests failed
with an early exit (e.g. an interpreter exit) then the regression code
would certify the test as passing if the subset of tests prior to the
failure worked. 

Regression tests use "--S N of M" on each start line of each test
so it is possible to check whether the final start line fulfills the
condition that N=M, that is, the last line reads "--S 20 of 20", etc.
If the test exits early, say at test 8, then the "--S 8 of 20" would
not fulfill the requirement and an error will now be indicated.

This check was added and some failing tests were brought up to the
new standard.

Failing tests are listed at the end of every system make.

+Bezier curves "move" based on moving their control points, which
+in the case of the three components of a quadratic Bezier curve
+are the three points given. To see this motion we can show what
+happens when you "drag" the middle control point along the line
+from [-4,4] to [4,4] by increments of 1. 
+
+First, we form the line as a list of Floats, 9 in all.
+
+   line:=[[i::Float,4.0] for i in -4..4 by 1]
+
+Next, we form a list of functions, each with a different center control point.
+Notice that the endpoints remain fized so we expect that the curve will
+begin and end at the same point but that the midpoint is pulled around.
+
+  functions:=[quadraticBezier([2.0,2.0],m,[6.0,2.0]) for m in line]
+
+Then we form a list of the graphs by calling each function in the above
+list. Each function call happens 101 times (to include both endpoints).
+Thus we get a List of Lists of Points of DoubleFloats
+
+  graphs:=[ [ point( ( (functions.i)(j/100.0) )::LIST(DFLOAT) ) _
+    for j in 0..100] for i in 1..9]
+
+We draw the first graph to see if it looks reasonable:
+
+  d1:=draw(graphs.1)
+
+Since it does we add the other 8 graphs. The 2D graphs can hold up to
+9 simultaneous graphs.
+
+  others:=[graphs.i for i in 2..9]

+\subsubsection{dvsum and dvdsum}
+The dvsum and dvdsum operations implement differentiation of sums with 
+and without bounds. Note that the function
+$$n\mapsto\sum_{k=1}^n f(k,n)$$
+is well defined only for integral values of $n$ greater than or equal to zero.
+There is not even consensus how to define this function for $n<0$. Thus, it is
+not differentiable. Therefore, we need to check whether we erroneously are
+differentiating with respect to the upper bound or the lower bound, where the
+same reasoning holds.
+
+Differentiating a sum with respect to its indexing variable correctly gives
+zero. This is due to the introduction of dummy variables in the internal
+representation of a sum: the operator [[%defsum]] takes 5 arguments, namely
+
+\begin{enumerate}
+\item the summands, where each occurrence of the indexing variable is replaced
+  by 
+\item the dummy variable,
+\item the indexing variable,
+\item the lower bound, and
+\item the upper bound.
+\end{enumerate}
+
+\subsubsection{dvprod and dvdprod}
+The dvprod and dvdprod operations implement differentiation of products with 
+and without bounds. Note again, that we cannot even properly define 
+products with bounds that are not integral.
+
+To differentiate the product, we use Leibniz rule:
+$$\frac{d}{dx}\prod_{i=a}^b f(i,x) = 
+  \sum_{i=a}^b \frac{\frac{d}{dx} f(i,x)}{f(i,x)}\prod_{i=a}^b f(i,x)
+$$
+
+There is one situation where this definition might produce wrong results,
+namely when the product is zero, but axiom failed to recognize it: in this
+case,
+$$
+  \frac{d}{dx} f(i,x)/f(i,x)  
+$$
+is undefined for some $i$. However, I was not able to come up with an
+example. The alternative definition
+$$
+  \frac{d}{dx}\prod_{i=a}^b f(i,x) = 
+  \sum_{i=a}^b \left(\frac{d}{dx} f(i,x)\right)\prod_{j=a,j\neq i}^b f(j,x)
+$$
+has the slight (display) problem that we would have to come up with a new index
+variable, which looks very ugly. Furthermore, it seems to me that more
+simplifications will occur with the first definition.
+
+\begin{verbatim}
+  f := operator 'f
+  D(product(f(i,x),i=1..m),x)
+\end{verbatim}
+
+\subsubsection{dvpow2}
+The dvpow2 operation implements the differentiation of the power operator 
+\verb|%power| with respect to its second argument, i.e., the exponent. 
+It uses the formula
+$$\frac{d}{dx} g(y)^x = \frac{d}{dx} e^{x\log g(y)} = \log g(y) g(y)^x.$$
+
+If $g(y)$ equals zero, this formula is not valid, since the logarithm is not
+defined there. Although strictly speaking $0^x$ is not differentiable at zero,
+we return zero for convenience.

+
+The binomial(n, r) returns the number of subsets of r objects
+taken among n objects, i.e. n!/(r! * (n-r)!)
+
+The binomial coefficients are the coefficients of the series expansion
+of a power of a binomial, that is
+
+    n
+   --+    / n \   k             n
+   >     |     | x    =  (1 + x)
+   --+    \ k /
+   k= 0
+
+This leads to the famous pascal triangle. First we expose the OutputForm
+domain, which is normally hidden, so we can use it to format the lines.
+
+  )set expose add constructor OutputForm
+
+Next we define a function that will output the list of binomial coefficients
+right justified with proper spacing:
+
+  pascalRow(n) == [right(binomial(n,i),4) for i in 0..n]
+
+and now we format the whole line so that it looks centered:
+
+  displayRow(n)==output center blankSeparate pascalRow(n)
+
+and we compute the triangle
+
+  for i in 0..7 repeat displayRow i
+
+giving the pretty result:

Waldek has implemented changes to the spad compiler to use 
+-> rather than #1 for anonymous function syntax which makes
anonymous functions easier to understand. He helped by pointing
out the explicit revisions that contained the changes.

Bezier was updated to test and use Waldek notation.

General Information

The scope of this workshop is at the intersection of programming
languages (PL) and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). The latter
category subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS),
interactive proof assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers
(ATP), all heading towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical
assistants. Areas of interest include all aspects of PL and MMS that
meet in the following topics, but not limited to:

  * Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages
    intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both
    algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic
    definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof
    languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming
    languages built into CA systems.=20

  * Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the
    relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For
    instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq
    is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML
    and Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such
    mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities,
    which are rarely available in regular programming languages. How
    can programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without
    limiting mathematics to the computational world view?

  * Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers
    advanced mathematical concepts in programming languages that
    improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type
    systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent
    types are of particular interest here, as is intentionality vs
    extensionality.=20

  * Language elements for program verification: covers specific means
    built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using
    MMS. For example, logical annotations within programs may be
    turned into verification conditions to be solved in a proof
    assistant eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make
    this work conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?

These issues have a very colorful history. Many PL innovations first
appeared in either CA or proof systems first, before migrating into
more mainstream programming languages.  This workshop is an
opportunity  to present the latest innovations in MMS design that may=20
be relevant to future programming languages, or conversely novel PL=20
principles that improve upon implementation and deployment of MMS.=20=20
Why are all the languages of mainstream CA systems untyped?  Why=20
are the (strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than=20
a typical CAS?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?=20=20
What forms of dependent types may be used in mathematical modeling?=20=20
How can MMS regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and
"modularity"?  What are the biggest barriers to using a more
mainstream language as a host language for a CAS or PA/ATP?=20

PLMMS 2007 was held as a satellite event of, and PLMMS 2008 was
a CICM 2008 workshop.

This is a major transition step in development. The tangle.lisp contains
all of the code necessary to extract the code chunks from a pamphlet file.
When using the latex syntax there is no need for a weave function since
the pamphlet file is pure latex. This will greatly simplify the system
builds since several changes are in the pipeline:
 
o) Rewrite the pamphlet files into latex syntax
   This removes the need to use weave anywhere in the system

o) Integrate the tangle function into the )co, )read, and other Axiom cmds
   This means that Axiom will now understand, and be able to directly 
   manipulate pamphlet files in their native form. The compiler will be
   able to compile directly and the interpreter can read directly.

o) Remove noweb from the makefiles.
   This greatly simplifies the makefile and removes a complete layer
   of build processing

o) Remove noweb
   The .tgz file will eventually be removed and no longer bundled with
   the system.
  

This code works with both noweb syntax, as in
    <<chunkname>>=
    <<achunk>>
    @

and latex syntax, as in

    \begin{chunk}{chunkname}
    \getchunk{achunk}
    \end{chunk}

Details of the prolog necessary to use the latex syntax is in the
documentation.

+;;; 1 ABSTRACT
+
+;;; This program will extract the source code from a literate file
+
+;;; A literate lisp file contains a mixture of latex and lisp sources code.
+;;; The file is intended to be in one of two formats, either in latex
+;;; format or, for legacy reasons, in noweb format.
+
+;;; Latex format files defines a newenvironment so that code chunks
+;;; can be delimited by \begin{chunk}{name} .... \end{chunk} blocks
+;;; This is supported by the following latex code.
+
+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
+;;; 2 THE LATEX SUPPORT CODE
+
+;;; The verbatim package quotes everything within its grasp and is used to
+;;; hide and quote the source code during latex formatting. The verbatim
+;;; environment is built in but the package form lets us use it in our
+;;; chunk environment and it lets us change the font.
+;;;
+;;; \usepackage{verbatim}
+;;; 
+;;; Make the verbatim font smaller
+;;; Note that we have to temporarily change the '@' to be just a character
+;;; because the \verbatim@font name uses it as a character
+;;;
+;;; \chardef\atcode=\catcode`\@
+;;; \catcode`\@=11
+;;; \renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\ttfamily\small}
+;;; \catcode`\@=\atcode
+
+;;; This declares a new environment named ``chunk'' which has one
+;;; argument that is the name of the chunk. All code needs to live
+;;; between the \begin{chunk}{name} and the \end{chunk}
+;;; The ``name'' is used to define the chunk.
+;;; Reuse of the same chunk name later concatenates the chunks
+
+;;; For those of you who can't read latex this says:
+;;; Make a new environment named chunk with one argument
+;;; The first block is the code for the \begin{chunk}{name}
+;;; The second block is the code for the \end{chunk}
+;;; The % is the latex comment character
+
+;;; We have two alternate markers, a lightweight one using dashes
+;;; and a heavyweight one using the \begin and \end syntax
+;;; You can choose either one by changing the comment char in column 1
+ 
+;;; \newenvironment{chunk}[1]{%   we need the chunkname as an argument
+;;; {\ }\newline\noindent%                    make sure we are in column 1
+;;; %{\small $\backslash{}$begin\{chunk\}\{{\bf #1}\}}% alternate begin mark
+;;; \hbox{\hskip 2.0cm}{\bf --- #1 ---}%      mark the beginning
+;;; \verbatim}%                               say exactly what we see
+;;; {\endverbatim%                            process \end{chunk}
+;;; \par{}%                                   we add a newline
+;;; \noindent{}%                              start in column 1
+;;; \hbox{\hskip 2.0cm}{\bf ----------}%      mark the end
+;;; %$\backslash{}$end\{chunk\}%              alternate end mark (commented)
+;;; \par%                                     and a newline
+;;; \normalsize\noindent}%                    and return to the document
+
+;;; This declares the place where we want to expand a chunk
+;;; Technically we don't need this because a getchunk must always
+;;; be properly nested within a chunk and will be verbatim.
+
+;;; \providecommand{\getchunk}[1]{%
+;;; \noindent%
+;;; {\small $\backslash{}$begin\{chunk\}\{{\bf #1}\}}}% mark the reference
+
+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
+;;; 3 GLOBALS
+
+;;; The *chunkhash* variable will hold the hash table of chunks.
+;;;
+;;; Every time we find a \begin{chunk}{name} ... \end{chunk} we look
+;;; in this hash table. If the ``name'' is not found we add it.
+;;; If the name is found, we concatentate it to the existing chunk.
+
+(defvar *chunkhash* nil "this hash table contains the chunks found")
+
+;;; This shows critical information for debugging purposes
+(defvar *chunknoise* nil "turn this on to debug internals")
+
+
+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
+;;; 4 THE TANGLE COMMAND
+
+;;;
+;;; The tangle command does all of the work of extracting code.
+;;; For legacy reasons we support 2 syntax forms, latex and noweb
+;;;
+;;; In latex form the code blocks are delimited by
+;;;     \begin{chunk}{name}
+;;;     ... (code for name)...
+;;;     \end{chunk}
+;;;
+;;; and referenced by \getchunk{name} which gets replaced by the code
+
+;;; In noweb form the code blocks are delimited by
+;;;     <<name>>=
+;;;     ... (code for name)...
+;;;     @
+;;;
+;;; and referenced by <<name>> which gets replaced by the code
+
+:;; There are several ways to invoke the tangle function. 
+;;;
+;;; The first argument is always the file from which to extract code
+;;;
+;;; The second argument is the name of the chunk to extract
+;;;    If the name starts with < then we assume noweb format as in:
+;;;        (tangle "clweb.pamphlet" "<<name>>")  <== noweb syntax
+;;;    Otherwise we assume latex format as in:
+;;;        (tangle "clweb.pamphlet "name")       <== latex syntax (default)
+;;;
+;;; The standard noweb chunk name is ``*'' but any name can be used.
+;;;
+;;; The third arument is the name of an output file:
+;;;  (tangle "clweb.pamphlet" "clweb.chunk" "clweb.spadfile")
+
+
+
+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
+;;; 5 THE TANGLE FUNCTION
+
+;;; This routine looks at the first character of the chunk name.
+;;; If it is a $<$ character then we assume noweb syntax otherwise
+;;; we assume latex syntax.
+;;;
+;;; We initialize the chunk hashtable
+;;; then read the file and store each chunk
+;;; then we recursively expand the ``topchunk'' to the output stream
+
+(defun tangle (filename topchunk &optional file)
+ "Extract the source code from a pamphlet file"
+ (let ((noweb? (char= (schar topchunk 0) #\<)))
+  (setq *chunkhash* (make-hash-table :test #'equal))
+  (when *chunknoise* (format t "PASS 1~%"))
+  (gcl-hashchunks (gcl-read-file filename) noweb?)
+  (when *chunknoise* (format t "PASS 2~%"))
+  (if (and file (stringp file))
+   (with-open-file (out file :direction :output)
+     (gcl-expand topchunk noweb? out))
+   (gcl-expand topchunk noweb? t))))
+
+
+
+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
+;;; 6 GCL-READ-FILE (aka read-sequence)
+
+;;; This would be read-sequence in ansi common lisp. Here we read
+;;; a line, push it onto a stack and then reverse the stack. The
+;;; net effect is a list of strings, one per line of the file.
+
+(defun gcl-read-file (streamname)
+ "Implement read-sequence in GCL"
+ (let (result)
+  (with-open-file (stream (open streamname))
+   (do (line eof)
+      ((eq line 'done) (nreverse result))
+    (multiple-value-setq (line eof) (read-line stream nil 'done)) 
+    (unless (eq line 'done) (push line result))))))
+
+
+
+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
+;;; 7 GCL-HASHCHUNKS
+
+;;; gcl-hashchunks gathers the chunks and puts them in the hash table
+;;;
+;;; if we find the chunk syntax and it is a
+;;;   define ==> parse the chunkname and start gathering lines onto a stack
+;;;   end    ==> push the completed list of lines into a stack of chunks
+;;;              already in the hash table
+;;;   otherwise ==> if we are gathering, push the line onto the stack
+
+;;; a hash table entry is a list of lists such as
+;;; (("6" "5") ("4" "3") ("2" "1"))
+;;; each of the sublists is a set of lines in reverse (stack) order
+;;; each sublist is a single chunk of lines. 
+;;; there is a new sublist for each reuse of the same chunkname
+
+;;; If the noweb argument is non-nil we assume that we are parsing
+;;; using the noweb syntax. A nil argument implies latex syntax.
+
+(defun gcl-hashchunks (lines noweb)
+ "Gather all of the chunks and put them into a hash table"
+ (let (type name chunkname oldchunks chunk gather)
+  (dolist (line lines)
+   (if noweb
+    (multiple-value-setq (type name) (ischunk-noweb line))
+    (multiple-value-setq (type name) (ischunk-latex line)))
+   (cond
+    ((eq type 'define)

+    ((eq type 'end)
+      (when *chunknoise* 
+       (format t "END name= ~a chunk=~s~%" chunkname (reverse chunk)))
+      (setq oldchunks (gethash chunkname *chunkhash*))
+      (setf (gethash chunkname *chunkhash*) (push chunk oldchunks))
+      (setq gather nil)

+      (push line chunk))))))

+;;; 8 GCL-EXPAND
+
+;;; gcl-expand will recursively expand chunks in the hash table
+;;; 
+;;; latex chunk names are just the chunkname itself e.g. chunkname
+;;; noweb chunk names include the delimiters, e.g: <<chunkname>>
+
+;;; a hash table entry is a list of lists such as
+;;; (("6" "5") ("4" "3") ("2" "1"))
+;;; so to process the chunk we reverse the main list and
+;;; for each sublist we reverse the sublist and process the lines
+
+;;; if a chunk name reference is encountered in a line we call expand
+;;; recursively to expand the inner chunkname.
+
+(defun gcl-expand (chunk noweb? file)
+ "Recursively expand a chunk into the output stream"
+ (let ((chunklist (gethash chunk *chunkhash*)) type name)
+  (dolist (chunk (reverse chunklist))
+   (dolist (line (reverse chunk))
