Dave,

Axiom has the same issues.

My take on this is that what you check depends on the reason you are 
checking.
If you are generating the output for human use (e.g. a table) then you 
want decimal.
If you are generating the output for regression testing (e.g. checking 
the answers on
multiple hardware) then you probably want Fateman's solution.

The output is used both for human use and for regression testing.  Its
primary use is human -- it's an example in the Sage reference manual:

   sage: float(e)
   2.7182818284590451

This is something a user will look at when reading the documentation
for some function.  It illustrates what happens when they convert the
symbolic constant e to float.

And therein lies the problem. We use a regression that does a comparison 
of the
printed representation of the output of the run with a stored copy of 
the output.

All of our regression tests were passing until I installed another, 
unrelated program.
Suddenly about 30 regression tests started failing. It turns out that 
the unrelated
program upgraded one of the system libraries. The net effect of that 
change was
to cause the last digit in the output to "wobble" so that some of the 
table values
differ in the nth place (20th, 30th, or thereabouts digit). This caused 
the regression
comparisons to fail.

Common lisp will give you the exact bit pattern of the float and this value
does not wobble so the text comparison succeeds with both the old and
the new libraries against the bit pattern.

So I can tell you from experience that what you would like to do is not
going to succeed.

Our solution to the human vs regression problem is to include the stable
bit values in the actual compare and keep the human values in a latex
table. This is easy to do with literate input.

What I would like to do does succeed.    The goal of the doctest suite
in Sage is:

  (1) to provide examples for users that illustrate every function in Sage,

  (2) assure that these examples run as claimed, in the sense that a
given input pasted into the Sage command line, results in the claimed
output (with certain well-defined assumptions about state).

You can view (1) as documentation for users, and view (2) as one form
of "regression testing".   There are many types of regression tests.

Regarding your example, I would consider it a bug if the specific
examples of Sage's floating point output -- as claimed in the examples
in the official documentation -- are wrong in the presence of certain
standard system-wide shared libraries.     That is to say, if the Sage
documentation says:

   sage: foo(bar)
   1.2345

but in fact in Sage one has

   sage: foo(bar)
   1.2351

then I would consider this misleading documentation, i.e., a bug.
Your statement above suggests that you *don't* consider this a bug at
all.   In Sage, one possible solution (and it depends on context
whether this it the right solution or not) would be to change the
documentation to

   sage: foo(bar)     # last few digits numerically unstable
   1.23...

The "..." in Python's doctest framework is a wildcard.     The Sage
code hasn't been changed, but the documentation has been.   The point
is that a read of the documentation for the function foo will see
explicitly -- right there in the documentation -- that there are
numerical noise issues on certain platforms.       We have followed
exactly this approach in all of the Sage example docstests, which now
total over 110,000 lines of input, testing over 19,000 functions (or
over 80% of the functions in Sage).

Tim,

I've been thinking about this although I'm not sure I've had any great 
insights? I don't claim to have any great expertise in the the deeper level 
mathematics myself so I thought I would just write down all the issues that 
occurred to me in case you or anyone had any ideas.

By the way, I'm still working on Grassman/Clifford algebra code here:
file:///home/master/euclid/maths/standards/program/clifford/

Although these algebras have common operations like addition, multiplication 
(exterior, inner...) and their inverses, they would be coded differently so I 
can't see now they would make use of common code in categories, or inherit 
from categories, in such a way to simplify the relationships between these 
related algebras.

In many cases we might want the algebra to be a module over algebras with one 
of the multiplications which is:

    * associative.
    * possibly commutative or non-commutative.
    * distributive over addition.

Although not all the multiplications in a given algebra/structure would have 
these properties.  We may want to have a module over an algebra with multiple 
multiplications, such as Grassmann/Clifford algebra itself, so we need a way 
to choose the multiplication which forms the module.

In addition to these requirements we can't take this algebra family in 
isolation but they need to interwork with related algebra families, It would 
be good if these algebra families need to appear on the category and domain 
graph here:
http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/dotabb.html
(its not complicated enough yet!)

Relationship to Other Algebras
-----------------------------------------
Since there are many accidental and not so accidental isomorphisms between 
Clifford algebras and Cayley-Dickson (complex, quaternion and octonion), 
spinor, Hopf and tensor Algebras, for instance: see tables in [Pertti 
Lounesto, Clifford Algebras and Spinors, Second Edition].

Do we need lots of coerce functions? Or can we represent some of these by 
choosing a suitable category hierarchy?

Are there common functions between these algebras that could be separated out 
into categories?

How to Choose a Hierarchy
--------------------------------------
How do we go about designing a category hierarchy structure? How does this 
relate to the way that algebras are created in mathematics?

By applying constraints?
--------------------------------
We could start with tensor algebra and represent these as a subalgebra by 
applying some constraint (like Pauli matrices). Is there a way to get a 
subalgebra in SPAD by applying constraints?

There is already an issue with working with sparse Clifford algebras and this 
approach would seem to make the issue of efficient coding and storage of 
variables even worse.

Also this would seem to go away from point of having a separate Clifford 
algebra implementation and so I don't think this approach is really practical?

By using isomorphisms?
----------------------------------
There are lots of isomorphisms between the algebra families, is it practical 
to treat say complex numbers or quaternions as special cases of a Clifford 
algebra? Probably not as complex numbers are used widely and need to be 
efficient.

Generating using semidirect product and so on?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Since it does not seem very efficient to use the category hierarchy to create 
subalgebras from more general algebras, can we do the reverse and build up 
more complex algebras from simpler ones?

For instance could we generate the quaternions from complex numbers whose 
elements were themselves complex numbers? Or could we generate quaternions 
from a semidirect product of two complex number algebras?

As SPAD stands at the moment I can't see how this is possible? We cant even 
create complex numbers whose elements are themselves complex numbers:

(1) -> a:= complex(complex(1,2),complex(3,4))
   There are 1 exposed and 0 unexposed library operations named complex
      having 2 argument(s) but none was determined to be applicable.
      Use HyperDoc Browse, or issue
                             )display op complex
      to learn more about the available operations. Perhaps
      package-calling the operation or using coercions on the arguments
      will allow you to apply the operation.

   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named
      complex with argument type(s)
                              Complex(Integer)
                              Complex(Integer)

      Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type,
      or "$" to specify which version of the function you need.
(1) -> 

What seems to be required is a way to allow the inner and outer complex 
numbers to define a different imaginary operator and to define how they 
interact:

a: Quaternion := complex(%i,complex(%j,1,2),complex(%j,3,4), %k=%i*%j)

Anyhow, at this stage I cannot see how to generate algebras in this way?

Common Functions on these Algebras
----------------------------------------------------
Although I can't see how to how to design a category hierarchy to usefully 
relate these algebra families I can think of some common functions that could 
be applied to these algebras.

This does not concern operations on instances of elements of these algebras 
but operations on the whole algebras, examples of the sort of things that I 
would like to be able to do is:

    * Create a Type consisting of a complex number whose elements are complex 
numbers whose elements are complex numbers, run a function to check if this 
algebra is associative.
    * run a function to check if the above algebra is isomorphic to octonions.
    * Start with a Clifford algebra based on 3 dimensional space, add another 
dimension that squares to +ve, add another dimension that squares to -ve, in 
the plane of these extra dimensions rotate by 45 degrees.
    * Orthogonalise a basis.
    * Take a semidirect product of two complex number algebras, check if this 
is isomorphic to quaternions.
    * Take an even subalgebra of a Clifford algebra based on 3D Euclidean 
space, check if this is isomorphic to quaternions.
    * Convert to reciprocal basis
    * Convert between Clifford and Grassmann basis.

So none of these operations involves creating an element (a representation) in 
these algebras, they are all functions which operate on the algebra (Type) as 
a whole. So what I was thinking of is an interface (category) that could be 
applied to many algebras (domains) to provide a common set of functions like:

    * addDimension(squaresTo)
    * isAssociative?()
    * isIsomorphic?(Type)
    * rotateDimensions(plane)
    * directProduct(Type,Type)
    * semidirectProduct(Type,Type,function)
    * evenSubalgebra()
    * constrainToOrthogonal()

In the case of Clifford algebras these functions would be implemented to 
operate purely on the bilinear form, in the case of other algebras they would 
be implemented to operate on what determines that algebra.

Camm,

I have been away on a business trip for the last week.
I will look at this shortly.

Great to be in contact again.

1) I've apparently fixed the issue with the non-native-reloc ports, at
least temporarily, by loading bookvol5 in makeint.lisp as a .lsp the
first time.  I provide more detail later if desired.

2) I've just committed to the 2.6.8pre branch socket code which I hope
will obviate the need for your recent read.d patch regarding
read-char-no-hang.  I really think the current behavior is correct,
though I could of course be overlooking something.  Newlines are read
and returned.  The old implementation, among other things, returned
'eof for (read-char-no-hang *standard-input* nil 'eof)<Return>. 

I think you are rolling your own socket code, but I've been testing
briefly with this:

=============================================================================
>(in-package 'si)

#<"SYSTEM" package>

SYSTEM>(defun foo (&rest r ) nil)

FOO

SYSTEM>(let* ((s (socket 8081 :server #'foo))(a (accept s))) (do nil ((eq 'eof (setq ch (read-char-no-hang a nil 'eof)))) (sleep 1) (when ch (print ch))))

#\a 
#\s 
#\d 
#\Return 
#\Newline 
NIL

SYSTEM>.
=============================================================================
(other xterm)
telnet localhost 8081 </tmp/foo
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.m.enhanced.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.
=============================================================================
file /tmp/foo
asd
=============================================================================

3) I don't really know how to test or use )browse at the moment.  And
I have forgotten how to escape to the lisp propmt, (as opposed to one
command at a time )lisp)

4) It would be great to integrate the compiler::link patches for now
at least.  At some point I hope to have native object relocation
everywhere, but this is likely a ways off.

Note I'm turning off sgc for now, but this should not be permanent.

    Hi,



     can someone explain  the following answer of axiom?

    

(12) -> sum(binomial(t+i,i),i=0..k)

                     t + k      t - 1
         (t + k + 1)(     ) - t(     )
                       k         - 1
   (12)  -----------------------------
                     t + 1
                                                    Type: Expression(Integer)
(13) ->

  Axion does not believe that  binomial(t-1,-1) is zero:
 


   (1) -> sum(binomial(t+i,i),i=0..k)

                    t + k      t - 1
        (t + k + 1)(     ) - t(     )

Camm,

Good to hear from you. Sorry for the delay. I was off at a conference all
of last week.

1) I've apparently fixed the issue with the non-native-reloc ports, at
least temporarily, by loading bookvol5 in makeint.lisp as a .lsp the
first time.  I provide more detail later if desired.



1) The bookvol5 file is eventually going to be the full interpreter. I am
moving all of the code (slowly and carefully) into that file. At the moment
only some of the macros have been moved. These macros need to be
in the compile environment so bookvol5 has to be loaded to pick up the
moved macros. This file also needs to be compiled and loaded later
since there are some functions that are currently defined in other files.

This is a temporary situation. I am "tree-shaking" the whole interpreter
so that I only pick up functions that are actually used. I have thrown away
piles of code that can never be referenced. There are still well over 100
files to process so the tree-shaking will probably take the rest of the 
year.
However, once the interpreter is isolated there will only be one literate
file that contains everything.

2) I've just committed to the 2.6.8pre branch socket code which I hope
will obviate the need for your recent read.d patch regarding
read-char-no-hang.  I really think the current behavior is correct,
though I could of course be overlooking something.  Newlines are read
and returned.  The old implementation, among other things, returned
'eof for (read-char-no-hang *standard-input* nil 'eof)<Return>. 

I think you are rolling your own socket code, but I've been testing
briefly with this:


I don't want my own socket code but I was unable to get the behavior I 
needed to
implement using Axiom as a web server. I will pick up your latest 
release and do a
build and test using it. I'm more than happy to use an unpatched lisp.

> 3) I don't really know how to test or use )browse at the moment.  And
> I have forgotten how to escape to the lisp propmt, (as opposed to one

 From the top level you can drop into lisp using ")fin" and you can 
return to Axiom
from lisp using "(restart)" You can also do ")lisp (setq $dalymode t)" 
which will
cause Axiom to interpret any expression that starts with an open-paren 
as lisp thus:

  )lisp (setq $dalymode t)
  (+ 1 1) => 2



 From the top level you type ")browse" and Axiom will now function as a 
web server on
the port (8085). At the moment you need to give a full path to the root 
page thus:

http://127.0.0.1:8085/home/axiom/mnt/ubuntu/doc/hypertex/rootpage.xhtml

Try Topics -> Numbers -> Integers -> x:=factorial(200) as an example.
You should see the result of the computation pasted inline in the webpage.

This should be easier and automatic but I have to write that code and I 
have not.

I have not used the compiler::link patch because I didn't understand it 
and could not get
it to work.. I will rewrite the makefile to use your changes and see if 
I can get it to work.

Do you know if GCL will build on a MAC? I used to have a MAC port 
working but
something broke and I cannot figure out what.

Tim

OK, but for now, if we want ia64, mips, mipsel, alpha, and hppa ports
(which maybe we don't), I need to get the interpsys build to load all
binary modules just once.  As I said before, things apparently work by
changing the bookvol5 load at the top of makeint.lisp to a .lsp load
as far as this file goes.  But there is alas something else that is
loading (autoloading?) the following file three times:

Error: Binary module load error:
 /home/camm/axiom-20091101/mnt/linux/algebra/exposed.o

Can you help here?  Can I use the same trick to load the first two
instances in .lsp form?

The issue is that on these platforms, native object relocation is
currently absent.  In gcl cvs, mips, mipsel, and alpha relocation become
available, but this still leaves ia64 and hppa, so we need
compiler::link for full portability.  

The idea here is to run the init sequence keeping a list of all loaded
.o files (which use dlopen on these systems and do not persist across
save-system), link in these binaries with the system linker, ld, and
then rerun the init sequence in the produced executable redirecting
all load calls to the previously linked in .o files to a simple
initialization of their program data.  This is reported as
"Initializing" instead of "Loading".  

The problem is that these files can exist in only one instance at the
ld stage, and at the init stage.  (I suppose I could try something
really fancy to copy and rename the files on the fly to file1, file2,
etc. if I had to.  This is tough as the compiled in init function in
each object is named according to the file name at compile time --
these function names have to be unique too.)

Thanks!

Alas my browser is hanging on the above url, so something needs
fixing.  I don't even get to read-char-no-hang:

(1) -> )lisp (trace read-char-no-hang)

Warning: READ-CHAR-NO-HANG is being redefined.
Value = (READ-CHAR-NO-HANG)
(1) -> )browse
listening on port 8085
 .....

Debugging suggestions?

Thanks!  Here are my patches, most of which are cosmetic:

It should, but our chief developer on this platform has disappeared,
and I have not tested here in quite a while.  It would be very good to
refresh this.

Take care,

Camm, the URL shown below is partially specific to your system
If you build axiom with the shell variable 

    $AXIOM=/home/axiom/mnt/ubuntu

then the URL will work as shown (assuming you build on ubuntu).
If you build on, say, a fedora10 system with the shell variable

    $AXIOM=/home/camm/mnt/fedora10

the URL would be:

http://127.0.0.1:8085/home/camm/mnt/fedora10/doc/hypertex/rootpage.xhtml

That is, you have to specify the complete path to the file rootpage.xhtml
(which will naturally have the $AXIOM prefix you used).

Tim






>From the top level you type ")browse" and Axiom will now function as a
web server on
the port (8085). At the moment you need to give a full path to the
root page thus:

http://127.0.0.1:8085/home/axiom/mnt/ubuntu/doc/hypertex/rootpage.xhtml

Try Topics -> Numbers -> Integers -> x:=factorial(200) as an example.
You should see the result of the computation pasted inline in the webpage.

This should be easier and automatic but I have to write that code and
I have not.




Thanks!

Alas my browser is hanging on the above url, so something needs
fixing.  I don't even get to read-char-no-hang:

(1) -> )lisp (trace read-char-no-hang)

Warning: READ-CHAR-NO-HANG is being redefined.
Value = (READ-CHAR-NO-HANG)
(1) -> )browse
listening on port 8085
 .....

Debugging suggestions?

Camm,

The file "exposed" sets 3 global variables
 |$globalExposureGroupAlist|
 |$localExposureDataDefault|
 |$localExposureData|

These are static, hand-maintained alists.

I have no idea why they are loaded multiple times.
They do not need to be. I will look into it.



OK, but for now, if we want ia64, mips, mipsel, alpha, and hppa ports
(which maybe we don't), I need to get the interpsys build to load all
binary modules just once.  As I said before, things apparently work by
changing the bookvol5 load at the top of makeint.lisp to a .lsp load
as far as this file goes.  But there is alas something else that is
loading (autoloading?) the following file three times:

Error: Binary module load error:
 /home/camm/axiom-20091101/mnt/linux/algebra/exposed.o

Can you help here?  Can I use the same trick to load the first two
instances in .lsp form?

Greetings!  

Odd thing is, if I go into int/interp, fireup
../../obj/linux/bin/lisp, and execute

(progn
			(setq si::*collect-binary-modules* t)
			(setq x si::*system-directory*)
			(load "../../obj/linux/interp/makeint.lisp")
			(setq si::*system-directory* x)
			(unintern (quote x))
			(compiler::link
				(remove-duplicates si::*binary-modules* :test (quote equal) :from-end t)
				"interpsys"
				(format nil "
					(let ((si::*load-path* (cons ~S si::*load-path*))
                                             (si::*load-types* ~S))
						(compiler::emit-fn t))
					 (setq si::*collect-binary-modules* t)
					 (setq x si::*system-directory*)
					 (load \"../../obj/linux/interp/makeint.lisp\")
					 (setq si::*system-directory* x)
					 (unintern (quote x))
					 (when si::*binary-modules*
						(error (apply (quote concatenate) (quote string) \"Binary module load error: \" si::*binary-modules*)))
					(setq si::collect-binary-modules* nil si::*binary-modules* nil)
					(gbc t)
					(fmakunbound (quote si::sgc-on))(when (fboundp (quote si::sgc-on)) (si::sgc-on t))
					(setq compiler::*default-system-p* t)
				" si::*system-directory* (quote (list ".lsp")))
			"../../obj/linux/lib/sockio-c.o ../../obj/linux/lib/cfuns-c.o ../../obj/linux/lib/libspad.a" 
			nil))

I get a perfectly fine interpsys which will finish the build, with no
exposed.o loaded at all.  Yes this same command in the
src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet autoloads exposed.o 3 times.
Puzzled.....

Take care,

Thanks Tim!  But it still hangs just as before.  What else can I
trace to see where I'm stuck?

You'd better stop doing such senseless things and do what the rest of
the world does: respect LDFLAGS and link dynamically.

This simplifies code much because you remove all these multiple
customizations.

It is hard to tell for sure, most likely you've broken FreeBSD support,
and Tim boasted that he supports FreeBSD.

Yes, but of course without the axiom respondign to requests.

The same url with http://127.0.0.1:8085/ put at the front looks like
it is connecting, but waits forever.  So the tcp port is open at
least. 

Take care,

hmm...

In the zips directory there is a copy of GCL that builds cleanly.
Does this connect? Is there any change in the socket code
between the gcl tgz in the zips directory and your latest version?

  Hi,

  Sorry if it is off topic (currently I am not subscribed to
axiom-developer).

  I updated the mandriva gcl and axiom packages some time ago. You can
see the files at:
http://svn.mandriva.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/packages/cooker/axiom/current/

  What would be the proper way to setup a single script to start, or
open a tab in, firefox from axiom? That is run something like:
firefox -remote
'openURL(localhost:8085/usr/lib64/axiom-3.4/doc/hypertex/topicspage.xhtml=
)'
once the ')browse' command was run.

  Something like running 'notebook()' in sagemath, or the command line
option 'sage -notebook'

Hi Tim!

One other issue is coming up.  You are resetting
si::*system-directory* in your restart function.  This is used in gcl
as distributed to find auxiliary files.  On most platforms, you don't
need any, so you don't notice this, but, again as currently
distributed, GCL can't find the cmpinclude.h file when you redirect
this variable.  I've got a work around for now, and this part of GCL
can certainly be made more foolproof, but my question is -- do you
need to set this variable?  Can't we let variables in the 'si package
be set by gcl?

Take care,

Camm,

I removed the line from restart and rebuilt/retested the system.
I can find no difference in behavior so Axiom will no longer set 
si::*system-directory*
This is available in the lastest patch. 20100115.03.tpd.patch
(git commit 509e5b024a)

Tim

Camm,

The latest patch removes the file exposed.lsp
so it no longer needs to be loaded at all.

Greetings!  Tim, is there a machine at your site onto which you would
mind giving me access?  Perhaps I could set this up for you there.

Take care,

Congratulations, Tim!

Separate question -- I notice there are many regression failures in
the build log.  Do you have any mechanism to identify "expected"
failures?  Or is there any other automated way to ensure the
correctness of the build?  For example, with maxima, the autobuilder
is instructed to abort if there are any "unexpected" test suite
failures. 

Take care,

There are failures in the build log but they are mostly expected failures.
They are designed to test deliberately failing cases.

The design of the regression test system is that you create an input file,
capture the output, and append it after the command with a prefix.

So

1+1

in an input file generates

  (1) 2
                  Type: PositiveInteger

Now you construct an input file that has some special comments
around this test case (see any file in src/input/*.input.pamphlet):

--S 1 of 32
1+1
--R  (1) 2
--R                Type: PositiveInteger
--E 1

Since anything with "--" is an axiom comment almost all of the lines
are ignored when the file is read. If you read the file and spool the
output you will see:

--S 1 of 32                                     <-- the testcase number
1+1                                             <-- the axiom input
                                                <-- the actual output
  (1) 2                                         <--
                  Type: PositiveInteger         <--
--R                                             <-- the expected output
--R  (1) 2                                      <--
--R                Type: PositiveInteger        <--
--E 1                                           <-- end of this testcase

We see the input (1+1) and the Axiom output. We also have comments that show
the expected Axiom output. There is a function called "regress" which 
will take this spool
output file (say, foo.output") and compare the actual Axiom output from 
the expected Axiom
output.

 )lisp (regress "foo.output")

It lists the successful and the failing test cases (look in 
int/input/*.regress)

At the very end of the build Axiom scans the regress files looking for 
any that fail.
Some can fail due to the fact that the algorithm is random. Others fail 
for various
reasons. I check these failure cases after every Axiom build.

Any failures either get fixed in the next update or get added to the 
known bugs list.

So, to answer your question, there are cases where the Axiom input fails 
intentionally
and the failing output is captured. This way it is possible to test 
known bad inputs.
The regression test system only cares that the answers are the same, it 
does not care
that the Axiom input is a known, intentional failure.

Thus, the regression test system can test both successful and failing 
input but will
only complain if some output did not match the previous results.

Very nice. I'll look into this further.

Are you aware of the work in Axiom Volume 11: The Axiom Browser?
It uses mathml for mathematics display.

Do I understand correctly, then, that as some failures are random, and
will therefore are expected to produce differences with previous
output, there is no way to really catch a case, say, where gcl is
blowing the algorithm on a new platform?  If so, a wishlist item would
be to add some flag that would indicate an expected stochastic
failure.  Then an autobuilder could be instructed to demand strict
compliance with some known output, or fail.

Take care,

Tim,

I did come across it although I did not fully take it in at the time, so much 
to learn when first looking at the Axiom documentation. The documentation 
probably needs a bit more overview at the start of volume 11 before jumping 
into build instructions so that newcomers can see what its all about.

It does seem a very nice idea, using the browser for what it is good at and 
use Axiom for doing the maths. Is this is what provides calculations for the 
Axiom wiki? It would be a good way to show new users the advantages of Axiom 
if there were a page where they could type in a formula ,or sequence of axiom 
commands, and see the result immediately on the web page.

Looking at the dates it looks like development on this stopped around 2007, so 
I guess interest must have declined, which seems a pity. 

Using the command line interpreter has pros and cons, I wonder if this could 
be a way to overcome the cons, for instance: allowing the user to enter 
mathematical symbols such as the Greek alphabet directly into the formula 
using buttons on the web page?

Martin Baker

Some of the algorithms are purely random so the result
has nothing to do with GCL.

Actually, there is behavior in floating point that differs
from platform to platform. Run
  grep machineFraction src/input/*

The floating point behavior differs from platform to platform.
I wrote 'machineFraction' to get at the actual bits in the
register (it uses common lisp's integer-decode-float, see
the code in books/bookvol5.pamphlet, e.g. integer-decode-float-numerator)

In src/input/dfloat.input.pamphlet you can see that

machineFraction(2.71828)

is not equal to

machineFraction(2.71828@DoubleFloat)

on Ubuntu, but they are equal on some other linux platforms.
They should be equal.

Why these differ is on the list to debug.

At the moment all of the energy is going into moving the source code 
from the
tree-of-tiny-files format into books. It takes a while to move a 
million-things-of-code,
along with rewrites and refactoring. I'm into the final stretch though 
as I only have to
consolidate the interpreter and compiler. I hope to have it finished by 
the end of the year.

Once that happens I will revisit each book with an eye to writing decent 
documentation
See the book Lisp In Small Pieces for the ultimate goal I hope to 
achieve. The books
only contain the source code for the most part. There will be much more 
once I get rid
of the 1960s-PDP-11-64K-sea-of-tiny-little-files organization.

Actually when you run the browser from the Axiom command line you can 
input expressions
into the browser and the computed result will open up a <DIV> in your 
browser with the results.
This works now. All of the Javascript/AJAX/mathml/axiom-interpreter code 
works so it is
easy to add new pages. Once I got a proof of concept working I went back 
to building up
the other books.

Arthur Ralfs is the person to credit for the mathml connection.

More of the hyperdoc pages have to be converted and there are plans for 
deeper documentation
in the browser format. The browser form already contains pages which are 
not in hyperdoc.
There are newly written pages and code examples from the NIST Digital 
Library of Mathematical Functions.
There are other pieces of work stacked up  to put into the Axiom 
browser. We really want
to support the bra and ket notation from quantum theory. (I've been 
playing with that for a
while and it would be nice if Axiom supported it better.)

The browser will certainly support unicode I/O. The question would be 
whether the lisp
system will support unicode, which would be nice because then you could 
input/output
symbols like sigma as though it were any other character. Since Axiom is 
listening on
the host end it can interpret unicode any way it likes.
