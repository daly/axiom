Subject: ACL2 and Axiom

  Well you've finally given me an example to motivate me.

We've had the "in-plan" task to embed ACL2 under Axiom (since
both run in common lisp) so we can use the facilities of ACL2
in our computer algebra system. I suspect there will be a bit of
dancing to get the initialization correct and to hide the top
level interface but Axiom and ACL2 live in different packages
so there shouldn't be much conflict.

In particular, this facility is of interest as a reasoning mechanism
behind a "proviso" facility, that is, "1/x provided x != 0".

Does ACL2 handle reasoning about interval arithmetic?
Are there particular books in ACL2 I should study?

Also, the SUBSETP test failed in GCL-2.6.8.
I will pull the latest GCL sources and try again.

I am not aware of an interval arithmetic book.  There have been
several undergraduate student projects to build simple interval
arithmetic books but none made it into the distribution.  Of course, I
presume you're aware of ACL2's extensive collection of rational and
integer arithmetic books, e.g., arithmetic-5/top and the modulo
arithmetic of ihs and the register-transfer/floating point stuff of
rtl (most recently rtl8).

Ok. Once I climb the learning curve I'll look at that
in more detail.

I've put up a git repository to contain the changes I need to make to
embed ACL2. Both Axiom and ACL2 can sit in the same lisp image. I have
to figure out some Axiom "cover" domains that export things like a
"prove" function and a compatible set of domains to cover the data
representation.

I looked at the code a bit last night. Most of the code changes would
involve things like #- conditionally removing the ACL2 user I/O and
GCL initialization.

Hi, Tim --

I wonder if another possibility might be to view Axiom as a sort of
slave to ACL2, rather than the other way around.  The sequence of
steps would be: (1) build ACL2 as usual; (2) start up ACL2 and exit
its read-eval-print loop (by typing :q); (3) load the Axiom files; and
(4) save an image.  The Axiom user could then do his usual stuff, but
when necessary, enter ACL2 to do whatever is necessary to discharge
proof obligations.  With such an approach, if ACL2 cannot prove a goal
automatically, then at least one could enter the ACL2 read-eval-print
loop and interact with it to come up with a proof.

I see two other potential advantages I can see for keeping ACL2
intact.  The first is that by avoiding modifications to ACL2, even in
small ways that you have in mind, you avoid the risk of unforeseen
tricky issues (after many years I'm still often surprised by
subtleties that arise when modifying ACL2), and you avoid having to
maintain your mods over time as ACL2 evolves.  The second is that an
ACL2 user could perhaps employ Axiom as a trusted oracle (using the
so-called "trust tag" mechanism for external tools), so that
computations done by Axiom are stored as ACL2 theorems (input =
output).

By the way, I suspect though that Axiom traffics in real (and complex)
numbers, or at least floating point numbers.  ACL2, however, is
restricted to rational (and complex rational) numbers.  So you might
want to consider instead Ruben Gamboa's modification ACL2(r) of ACL2,
which is distributed with ACL2 but built with a different "make"
command.  That system supports reals and complexes, though still not
floats.

I'd be happy to discuss any of this with you further, either on the
list if you think others want to join in, or individually.

I see a few uses for ACL2/Axiom. One is as a build-time proof checker
to raise the level of system quality. A second is as a basis for some
research ideas I have about provisos. A third is as an end-user set of
Axiom domains for doing proofs (e.g. exporting a "prove" function)

The first issue of raising the level of system quality would involve
build-time proof checking which, if it failed, would be expected to
stop the build. There would be no need for a user interface.

The second issue of proviso work is "unpublished ideas" involving
interactions between Axiom domains. I have some ideas for symbolic
intervals and I think that ACL2 would be useful there. This also does
not involve a user interface since it only interacts with dynamically
created Axiom objects. This involves a pile of "scope issues" since
sets of provisos would live in a tree structure which Axiom needs to
manage.

The third issue of the end-user "cover" functions would capture and
expose the ACL2 functionality (e.g. prove) applied to Axiom objects
(e.g.  rationals, aka Fraction(Integer) in Axiom-speak). This might
involve user interaction with ACL2 but I haven't given that issue any
thought.  It may be that the interactive portion "just works"
depending on who is reading the user input at the time. If the system
falls into an ACL interactive loop doing its own reads then Axiom
won't know or care.  There is no such thing as a simple job, of
course.


In the long term plan I want Axiom to have a solid, proven set of
algorithms but the proofs are static. The build times would be much
longer but the end user wouldn't see that. They would only see
"certified" results. I would consider it a milestone if I could
automatically prove that Axiom's Euclidean algorithm was correct. Just
getting this right would be a whole PhD thesis :-)

So the long term goal is a computer algebra system with proven
algorithms rather than a system that proves things and uses a computer
algebra system.  Hence ACL2 lives "inside" Axiom by design.

I've created a git repository to track changes. That way I can pull the
latest ACL2 and merge my patches over your master code. I expect that there
will be several kinds of changes.

The first would be some #-Axiom conditionals to remove things like GCL
specific configurations that Axiom already does. Since we live in different
packages I don't think there will be function/macro name collisions. These
will not be of interest to you upstream.

The second will be adding bi-directional functions to convert ACL2 data
(e.g. rationals) and Axiom data (Fraction(Integer)). These will not be of
interest to you upstream.

The third will be some work on "proviso" or "interval" books.
These would be of interest to you and I'd push them upstream.

Another issue, from the Axiom side, is that Axiom is a literate program.
I'd like the proofs to also be literate since the intended audience for
the proofs is a human. I'm not yet familiar enough with the ACL2 code base
to have an informed opinion on this.

Axiom supports a lot of number types, including roman numerals :-)
My initial interest is intervals with a mixture of rational and symbolic
endpoints.

Machine reals (aka Axiom DoubleFloats) are of interest in that I'm
working on some numerics. It would be of interest to prove that no
reordering of Axiom-defined arithmetic operators causes results to
deviate by more than a small bounded number of low-order bits.

I've spent the last 5 years of my professional life at CMU (Axiom
is a hobby not related to work) developing the Intel machine level
semantics of instructions. We can now reason about machine code
sequences using conditional-concurrent assignments (CCAs). This
research is part of the Linger-Mills-Witt function semantics. It
will be interesting to see if there is a useful connection between
the function extraction semantics work and ACL2 machine-level proofs.

Floats (Axiom floats, that is) just make my head hurt. I don't think
I'm man enough to prove anything about them :-)

Greetings!  The FSF has requested that we "change the software license
to GPLv3 or later, and the documentation license FDLv1.3 or later".
By this I think they mean LGPLv3 of course.  To remain consistent with
the Debian Free Software guidelines, I think we'd have to add "with no
invariant sections, no front-cover texts and no back-cover texts'" to
the doc license.  I don't see any problem with this, but I thought I'd
put this out for comment just in case anyone else does.

Separately, at some point we might want to discuss having the FSF hold
the copyright, if that is even possible, let alone desirable.

I'm considering removing the binutils subtree, as all targets are
working now with custreloc save ia64 and hppa, which use dlopen as
always.  One can still build against an external bfd library if
desired.  It is probably necessary to keep the local gmp copy as a
convenience as many users don't seem to have this installed.

Indeed.  That does have some implication for systems like the AXIOM family.

well those are separate issues, I would think.  Having FSF owns
copyright relieves from some legal paperwork and burdens.  That is
largely orthogonal to who actually does the development work.

Please excuse my ambiguous wording.  The proposal is to license GCL
under LGPLv3 (currently LGPLv2), and the documentation under the
FDLv1.3.  The LGPL 'library' license is non-viral for apps such as
axiom.

Yes, this is orthogonal, and not too pressing.  But I do wonder if the
copyright holder has final say over issues such as licensing, which
might not be the case now.

Forgive me if I've mistaken your meaning, but there is an FDL:

A change to the most recent licenses will make things consistent with
FSF's current way of thinking about open source, though more
aggressive developers seem to think it's restrictive.  Given the
typical users and usual applications of GCL, this may not be an issue.

But I'm not sure -- if GCL is licensed under GPL3, does that mean that
anything built with or under it will also have to be licensed under
GPL3?  (I guess that's why Camm is querying the Axiom list.)

And copyrighting GCL under the FSF seems like a reasonable idea, but
without Camm, GCL would be fairly well static, I think.

  I have previously discussed the question of using GCL with Axiom.
GCL, originally ACKL, was written under IBM contract for Axiom.

Both the FSF and Stallman in direct email said there was no problem
using GCL with the mBSD code in Axiom. Note that Axiom distributes
and builds directly from the unmodified sources in the repository.
We add any patches, which we also distribute, at build time.

Since the whole philosophical point of the GPL license is to
guarantee the 4 freedoms, they are still guaranteed by this procedure.

You are of course correct and nothing in this proposal changes this.
The essence lies in the documentation license, which some have
interpreted as 'non-free' as they allow (but do not require) the
authors to specify some sections as 'unmodifiable'.  If GCL adopts the
new doc license, no such sections will (ever) be so designated.  This
satisfies the Debian Free Software Guidelines as well.

It seems all parties can be happy with this.  I was just asking if I
had overlooked something.

Take care,
