Subject: findSpadFiles problem

Bill,

I'm building Axiom for another release and I've discovered a problem
that needs to be fixed. The findSpadFiles routine in the
src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet file is generating duplicate targets
resulting in the error messages:

Makefile: NNNN: warning: ignoring old commands for target `.....`

after investigating the problem it appears that there is a built-in
assumption that the chunk names are unique. However, a document style
I use has violated that. This is the first time I've used it in the
algebra so it never happened before. 

In noweb you can say


mumble, mumble, ...
<<foo>>=
  chunk, 
  chunk
@

more words
 
<<foo>>=
  continued chunk
@

etc. That is, you can insert documentation inline in a chunk by 
just using the same chunkname. The second chunk gets concatenated
with the first. In src/algebra/combfunc.spad.pamphlet I've done:

<<package COMBF CominatorialFunction>>=
 .....
@
words to explain the change
<<package COMBF CominatorialFunction>>=
 .....
@

The findSpadFiles stanza reads:


egrep '@<<(domain|package|category) .*>>=' *.spad.pamphlet | \
awk -F: '{
  chunk=substr($2,3,length($2)-5);
  split(chunk,part," ");
  spadfile="\${MID}/"part[2]".spad";
  print spadfile": \${IN}/"$1;
  print "\t@\${TANGLE} -R\""chunk"\" \${IN}/"$1">"spadfile;
  print "";
}'

and I'm tempted to rewrite it to include a call to 'uniq' thus:


egrep '@<<(domain|package|category) .*>>=' *.spad.pamphlet | uniq | \
awk -F: '{
  chunk=substr($2,3,length($2)-5);
  split(chunk,part," ");
  spadfile="\${MID}/"part[2]".spad";
  print spadfile": \${IN}/"$1;
  print "\t@\${TANGLE} -R\""chunk"\" \${IN}/"$1">"spadfile;
  print "";
}'

Patch-47 is up. The primary changes are:

the axiom tutorial book was published at lulu.com (ISBN 1-4116-6597-X)
src/doc contains both the tex source and a pdf of the axiom tutorial book.
it should be available on amazon in about 8 weeks.

changes for the mac version were back-ported.
the mac port still does not work.

cleanup and documentation changes.

i'll be away until the 15th.

Yes. If you have a file

cat aaa.txt | uniq
gives

Only cat aaa.txt | sort | uniq
results in

Sorry that this comes to late, but 

  For example, Axiom's integrator gives you the answer when an answer

  For example, Axiom's integrator gives you the answer when an answer in terms

it is not true. The Risch algorithm is *not* completely implemented in Axiom,
unfortunately. It might be more complete than the ones in MMA and Maple, I
doubt that it's better than MuPAD, but boasting that it is complete is unwise,
I'm afraid.

>From Axiom point of view your function is very complicated: you have
a transcendental function, that is "cos(theta)" and then you make
an algebraic extension ("sqrt(1-b*cos(theta))") and finally you
again make a transcendental extension. 

There is a calculs-102 method to simplify your integral: take x = cos(theta).
Then we get a new integral:

integrate(exp(-a*sqrt(1-b*x))/sqrt(1 - x*x), x)

Now we have a transcendental extension of an algebraic extension. On this
one Axiom just runs out of memory. However this one is still pretty
complicated since we have an algebraic function in the exponent. So
put z = sqrt(1-b*x). Now we get:

integrate(z*exp(-a*z)/sqrt(1 - ((1 - z^2)/b)^2), z)

which Axiom returns unevaluated. AFAIU that means that Axiom proved
that the function have no elementary integral. 

One way to handle the integral above would be to expand exponential
into Taylor series. Then we will get a sequence of integrals like

integrate(z^k/sqrt(1 - ((1 - z^2)/b)^2), z)

Those are elliptic integrals, typically non-elementary. Since thay have
a common irrational part one can reduce then to a couple of base
cases. Of course, the tricky part is that we have coefficients and
we want to sum the whole thing. I did not try to do reductions (going
from general k tobase case) but since the reductions work in recursive
way the coefficients will be like hypergeometric progression. So
The result seem to be a sum of products of elliptic functions with
some kind of very general hypergeometric functions.

I doubt that one can get more explicit description. OTOH miracles do
happen and due to some strange coincidence the integral may be equal
to something simpler (after all, Axiom got stuck on original integral
in it search for miracles).

Rather than just state that there is a typo: please, please
state exactly the error and the correction. Or better yet
include a 'diff -au' patch to correct the error.

If, we can finish the implementation of this algorithm in Axiom,
then would your re-worded statement above be correct?

Of course we are really talking about "anti-derivatives", not
integration as such. Manuel Bronstein has written extensively
about this:

http://www-sop.inria.fr/cafe/Manuel.Bronstein/publications/issac98.pdf
http://www-sop.inria.fr/cafe/Manuel.Bronstein/publications

So what "elementary functions" are being considered by Axiom's
algorithm? E.g. addition, division, exponents, logarithms,
multiplication, polynomials, radicals, rationals, subtraction,
and trigonometric expressions such as suggested here:

Eric W. Weisstein. "Elementary Function." From MathWorld--A Wolfram
Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryFunction.html

Or should we be talking about "closed forms" as in the reference:

http://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/9805045?front

Date: Fri, 8 May 1998 22:49:15 GMT   (12kb)

What is a closed-form number?
Authors: Timothy Y. Chow
Comments: 11 pages; submitted to Amer. Math. Monthly

If a student asks for an antiderivative of exp(x^2), there is a
standard reply: the answer is not an elementary function. But if
a student asks for a closed-form expression for the real root of
x = cos(x), there is no standard reply. We propose a definition
of a closed-form expression for a number (as opposed to a *function*)
that we hope will become standard. With our definition, the question
of whether the root of x = cos(x) has a closed form is, perhaps
surprisingly, still open. We show that Schanuel's conjecture in
transcendental number theory resolves questions like this, and we
also sketch some connections with Tarski's problem of the decidability
of the first-order theory of the reals with exponentiation. Many
(hopefully accessible) open problems are described. 

--------

Or some other definition such as:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_functions#Elementary_functions

> It might be more complete than the ones in MMA and Maple, I doubt
> that it's better than MuPAD, but boasting that it is complete is

Since it was obviously the intention of the author of Axiom's
integration algorithm that it completely implement the Risch
algorithm and in spite of:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RischAlgorithm.html

"The case of algebraic extensions is quite complicated and is
therefore not completely implemented in any computer algebra
system."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm

"The Risch decision procedure is not formally an algorithm because
it requires an oracle that decides whether a constant expression
is zero, a problem shown by Daniel Richardson to be undecidable.
Transforming the Risch decision procedure into an algorithm that
can be executed by a computer is a complex task that requires the
use of heuristics and many refinements."

-------

What are the prospects for actually completing this programme in
Axiom rather than "correcting" the documentation? So far we have
documented the following cases:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/198IntegrateSinX2XIsNotHandled

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/199IntegrateExpX2ExpXXX

and the Risch algorithm is mentioned in the following places in
the current Axiom source:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/EfstrucSpad
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/IntafSpad
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/IntefSpad
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/IntrfSpad

And we also have Manuel Bronstein's work on

http://www-sop.inria.fr/cafe/Manuel.Bronstein/pmint/index.html

pmint - The Poor Man's Integrator

pmint is a very short (95 lines) Maple program for integrating
transcendental elementary or special functions. It is based on recent
improvements to a powerful heuristic called parallel integration.
While it is not meant to be as complete as the large commercial
integrators based on the Risch algorithm, its very small size makes
it easy to port to any computer algebra system or library capable of
factoring multivariate polynomials. Because it is applicable to special
functions (such as Airy, Bessel, Whittaker, Lambert), it is able to
compute integrals not handled by the existing integrators.

pmint is not meant as a replacement for existing integrators, but either
as an extension, or as a cheap and powerful alternative for any computer
algebra project. 

-------

It would be wonderful to have this available in Axiom.

You're right. In fact, I realize now that there is no typo. I thought that

Well. I should have been more careful in my wording: I doubt that the Risch
algorithm is completely implemented in Axiom. I should also have added what you
cited from wikipedia:

> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm

> "The Risch decision procedure is not formally an algorithm because it

> problem shown by Daniel Richardson to be undecidable.

Therefore, the answer to

> If, we can finish the implementation of this algorithm in Axiom,
> then would your re-worded statement above be correct?

is no. Furthermore, Axiom only returns "failed" if the Risch procedure didn't
succeed, which constitutes hardly a proof...

Still, it would be great if we could complete the implementation of the Risch
"algorithm". (Or find out that it is completely implemented anyway.)

yes.

Well, hopefully SumIt will become open source some time -- they
promised. Renaud Rioboo told me that the integrator in SumIt *might* be an
updated version of Axioms integrator... The person in charge with open-sourcing
Manuels code is Stephen Dalmas, I was told. However, he did not respond to my
queries. I don't know why we are so unlucky regarding these Aldor related
things.

> So far we have documented the following cases:
 
> http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/198IntegrateSinX2XIsNotHandled
> 
> http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/199IntegrateExpX2ExpXXX

Both of these are unrelated to the Risch procedure, since the results are not
elementary.

However, INTALG in intalg.spad knows the following errors:

  FAIL0 ==> error "integrate: implementation incomplete (constant residues)"
  FAIL1==> error "integrate: implementation incomplete (non-algebraic
  residues)"
  FAIL2 ==> error "integrate: implementation incomplete (residue poly has
  multiple non-linear factors)"
  FAIL3 ==> error "integrate: implementation incomplete (has polynomial part)"

At least FAIL0 does occur:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SymbolicIntegration

However, I do not know whether the integrals are doable by Risch -- I doubt
that they are. Maybe Richard Fateman can help here. He might also know how to
find out whether the Risch algorithm is completely implemented.

> And we also have Manuel Bronstein's work on

> It would be wonderful to have this available in Axiom.

Yes. Although the implementation of the Risch algorithm in Axiom seems pretty
good, Axiom's integrator is quite weak in pattern matching and integration of
special functions and the like. So it would be nice to do some work here. If
you have too much spare time, maybe you could try to understand what pmint
does? (Do you have Maple available?)

HOWEVER: I am not an integration expert, and I guess that I would waste my time
trying to work on all parts of Axiom. I think we should rather hire an
integration expert :-)

Martin

PS: Google came up with the following by Bronstein himself, confirming that
there are unimplemented branches. This should go into the documentation, I
suppose:

http://groups.google.com/group/sci.math.symbolic/browse_frm/thread/61795a53c580d892

There is also 

http://www.math.univ-montp2.fr/FODESIT/SemJuin2004/Bronstein/bronstein.pdf

which might shed some light on the subject.

Line 29 of pamphletWrapper.py is:
...

class NowebError(Exception): pass            <-------- compare
class DviPdfError(Exception): pass
class DviPngError(Exception): pass

    errors = ""

       errors = str(data)
       log(errors, 'NowebSyntaxError')
       return escape(errors)

--------

This *is* an error in the source code. It should be:

    except NowebError, data:

In my tests this exception never tripped so I did not find
the error earlier. You should correct this in your version of
the code (I will correct it in on MathAction.). You should
also check to find the reason why the runNoweb call is causing
the exception. One possible reason is that your path to notangle
might be different. The command line for notangle in runNoweb
is at Line 102:

cmdLine =
  "cd '%s'; /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/lib/noweave -delay =
'%s.pamphlet'"

which of course is specific to the installation of Axiom on
the axiom-developer.org server. You will have to change this
and other similar local references.

Let me know if this helps.

In the Doyen CD, Axiom is located in the /etc directory. I will put it now
in the /usr/local/ directory to follow the standard. However, I am using th=
e
Feb2005 build for Fedora Core 3. This one has the following structure:

axiom/mnt/fedora3/bin instead of axiom/mnt/linux/bin

I changed the name of the directory. Axiom seems to work without a problem.
I wanted to know if this is okay, or if you think I should use another Axio=
m
build with the axiom/mnt/linux/bin structure.

Thank you very much,

Subject: Local MathAction

Last night, I followed the steps at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/InstallingMathAction

with some modifications. After

      cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/texbreaker* .

I had to add

      cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/useproto.h .

because that file was missing for the compilation.
I also have no Reduce, so I commented out the Reduce related things 
(only the line numbers were a bit different).

In /usr/lib/zope/lib/python/Products/axiomWrapper.py I've changed

     cmdLine = 'export AXIOM=/usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux; export 
PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH; export ALDORROOT=/usr/local/aldor/linux/1.0.2; 
export PATH=$ALDORROOT/bin:$PATH; export HOME=/var/lib/plone2/main; 
AXIOMsys < %s' %(axiomFileName)

to

     cmdLine = 'export AXIOM=/home/hemmecke/software/Axiom/mnt/linux; 
export ALDORROOT=/home/hemmecke/software/Aldor/aldor/linux/1.0.2; 
PATH=$ALDORROOT/bin:$AXIOM/bin:$PATH; AXIOMsys < %s' %(axiomFileName)

(everything on just one line)

I had no idea what to do with HOME since there is no /var/lib/plone2 on 
my system.

texbreaker.mak is ...

swig -python texbreaker.i
gcc -fpic -c texbreaker.c texbreaker_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python2.3
ld -shared texbreaker.o texbreaker_wrap.o -o _texbreaker.so

I had to install swig (www.swig.org). Fortunately there was a Debian 
package.

I also had to
gcc -fpic -c texbreaker.c texbreaker_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python2.2
instead of
gcc -fpic -c texbreaker.c texbreaker_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python2.3

Everything worked fine up to here. But which URL should I write into 
firefox in order to now browse MathAction locally? I somehow fear that 
the webpages are not yet on my computer. Where is the MathAction FrontPage?

Any hints?

Another question... I have the Axiom sources from 
http://axiom-developer.org/archive/axiom. Would that be the same as
"darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom"?

I think there is no standard, but there are a few common conventions
that are used on different linux systems (not all). The important
thing is to be consistent.

Axiom can be located anywhere but the AXIOM environment variable
has to be set correctly, corresponding to the new location.

I think HOME is needed only for running PolyMake in Martin Rubey's
Axiom interface. PolyMake tries to set up some defaults in the
"users" home directory. This can be set to any convenient location.
I chose the root of the Zope instance which on axiom-developer is
'/var/lib/plone2/main'. On your system the Zope instance is probably
in a different place. Check $ZOPEHOME.

Do you use

  apt-get install swig

Well, this is a quesition of a different sort... :) What you
appear to be asking is how to run the wiki software. I presume
that you did previously install Zope, right? So to start Zope
need to do

  $INSTANCE_HOME/bin/zopectl start

This starts the server process and is the way you should normally
start the server. But it might be better to start with

  $INSTANCE_HOME/bin/runzope

which runs zope as a process in your current session and gives
some useful console output. You should see some warning messages
but no error messages.

You should now be able to access the Zope management interface
from a web browser on your system via the url

  http://localhost:8080

(port 8080 is the default port for Zope)

If all is well, then you will need to use this interface to add
new "Zwiki" object called 'mathaction' with the (*) latexwiki
option checked off.

To access the FrontPage of your new 'mathaction' wiki use the
url

  http://localhost:8080/mathaction

If you get this far, then you are doing very well... If not just
ask. Either way, let me know how it goes. I think the learning
curve for Zope probably seems quite steep but really it is not
so difficult once you get used to do (almost) everything through
the web browser interface.

Later there will be some more detailed instructions for making
some additional customizations to the ZWiki page templates that
need to appear in the root folder of the mathaction wiki. But
we will get to that later.

Yes it is the same, but this is not a probably. You should be
able to use any version of Axiom that you currently have
installed on your system.

This is caused by the fact that the server configuration on axiom-developer
(MathAction) aggressively tries to cache all images for reasons of efficiency.
It is supposed to be possible to configure the Apache web server to notice a
change in the image file and send a 'cache invalid' message to the front-end
web cache (maybe it is a Squid server somewhere in the ISP RoseHosting
network but I am not sure), however I have not been able to get this to
work. Caching of images can even occur at the level of the browser itself.

Dear Ralph

It's a long time I had installed AxiomWiki on my computer. In the mean time I
don't use it anymore, because I would have had to find some way to automatise
the set-up, because updates on the software used to overwrite the changed
files.

Anyway: I doubt that you can use AxiomWiki locally without having Zope
installed (and Plone is built on top of Zope, but I didn't understand what
you referred to). From where you got to, you need to restart Zope. Create a
new Zope document and choose "AxiomWiki" as its format. Within that document
you can do the \begin{axiom} ...\end{axiom}.

I haven't followed some of the threads, so I might have missed something. If
you want the existing MathAction locally, the admin of the Axiom wiki will
have to export a Zope object for you (as far as I remember, because Zope uses
a local object store; I don't think that users can initiate the export).

With best regards

H.P.

Greetings!  Am happy to announce that I've restored xgcl-2 in stable
release candidate version 2.6.8pre (in cvs) (and soon in cvs head):

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl
cvs -z9 -q co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl
cd gcl-2.6.8pre && ./configure && make && make xgcl

or 

cd gcl-2.6.8pre && ./configure && make && cd xgcl-2 && make

I've checked the demos, and they look good.  I would like to integrate
this as an autoloadable module built by default in the next release if
possible.  There remains a bit of work, the hardest part of which is
deciding exactly how to do this :-).

A few issues:

1) X10.h is no longer supported by X.  I've managed to find an old
   version, and have inlined the header into general-c.c, but it would
   be perhaps more proper to replace the obsolete X10 interface with
   an X11 equivalent.  This is beyond my immediate expertise.

2) It still remains to get the build working against the ansi image.
   I suggest here that we abandon the older :system-p based
   compilation system in favor of the equivalent but more portable
   'compiler::link interface.  This will free us from any direct
   reference to a particular saved image (either traditional or ansi),
   and need only be run (on most architectures) on the explicitly
   compiled C files, leaving the remaining .lsp files compilable,
   loadable, and dumpable without the :system-p flag.  Actually, the C
   files themselves could be included via (clines "....") into
   compilable and loadable lisp.  This needs more thought --
   suggestions are most welcome.

3) There is a very large set of imports in xgcl-2/gcl_imports.lsp.  If
   this does not bother one for generic use, one approach would be to
   select a few of these, such as 'draw, 'pcalc, 'menu, and perhaps a
   few others, which would autoload the xgcl "module" together with
   the imports file, and output a simple help text to the screen.  Bob
   Boyer has previously expressed his opinion that autoloading is
   problematic and non-portable.  If this is the consensus, then we
   should pre-load the compiled files into all images, and perhaps
   only autoload the imports file, or perhaps rather export the
   symbols from 'xlib instead and instruct the user to (use-package
   'xlib).  I hesitate to pollute the default user package namespace
   with so many specific symbols.

4) Documentation -- I suppose the dwdoc.tex should be converted to
   info format and included in or along side of gcl-si.texi.  Perhaps
   also the Xakcl-paper, though this is clearly more work.

More later,

Camm,

>Am happy to announce that I've restored xgcl-2

That's very good news!  Thank you very much for your help on this.

I don't mind at all if one has to deliberately load something
to get xgcl.  It makes sense to load something rather than autoload,
especially if it causes portability problems.  Likewise, I agree
that we should not pollute the name space with many symbols.
If use-package does what is needed, that would be fine.

If you could send me the X10.h and the X11 equivalent, I could look
at bringing things up to X11.

I have a program to convert LaTeX to html, so I could easily convert
dwdoc.tex to html if that would help.

The proper way for me (us?) to do this would be to re-write
the MathAction extensions of LatexWiki in a portable way so
that it is self-configuring and/or easily configurable.
Since MathAction was originally just an experiment - not
intended as "releasable" software - I did not bother to do
this.

In the mean time, Bob McElrath also decided that he no longer
wanted to maintain the LatexWiki extension of ZWiki. He and
I have discussed the possibility of actually merging the
MathAction extensions with LatexWiki and maybe even doing a
fork of ZWiki specifically for this purpose. Then there would
only be one Zope product to install that would include
everything (except Axiom itself). But neither Bob nor I seem
to have found enough time or motivation to do this yet.

The recent interest expressed on this list in a local version
of MathAction by Ralf Hemmecke and possibly Cliff Yapp and
Martin Rubey, plus the possible use of the MathAction ideas on
the Doyen CD (Alfredo Portes), suggests that maybe we should
examine this possibility again. From the point of view of Axiom
we might consider this as just another type of user interface.
I would be very happy if someone else wanted to take responsibility
for such a project. I am willing to help anyone in as much detail
as necessary, but I am very reluctant to take the lead.

Plone is not required in order to run the Axiom Wiki. I don't
think the Plone portal software is of much interest for stand
alone use.

Right now, I think the best way to get to this point is
one-step-at-a-time. I will try my best to describe this below.
If someone besides me can get this to work, I will eventually
update the instructions on the Axiom Wiki appropriately.

Your first goal should be to get a running version of ZWiki.

http://zwiki.org

See http://zwiki.org/Installing

for details.  Current Zwiki requires Zope version 2.7 or 2.8.

In all open source software such as this I recommend going for
the newest version of everything possible even though this
sometimes will cause some headaches later concerning compatibility
of other components. Since most open source software is "released
early and released often", in most cases this strategy will result
in the most stable and best performing system. In particular this
would mean using the newest version of Zope (2.8) and Python (2.4).

All of this is made quite easy on Debian (use Debian version
Sarge/testing to get the newest versions):

See: http://zwiki.org/InstallingOnDebian

Using apt-get, e.g.

   $ apt-get install zope2.8
   $ mkzope2.8instance
      Directory: zope1 (for example)
      Username: (an initial manager username
      Password:  and password)
   edit /var/lib/zope2.8/instance/zope1/etc/zope.conf
      uncomment debug-mode and set it off, for better performance
      make note of the http port number (9673) or change it
   $ /var/lib/zope2.8/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl start

At this point you should be able to use a web browser to locally
access the Zope Management Interface (ZMI):

http://localhost:9673/manage

(enter manager username and password).

Refer to the Zope documentation:

http://www.zope.org

for more information about using ZMI.

Now get the newest version of ZWiki:

   $ apt-get install darcs
   $ cd /var/lib/zope2.8/instance/zope1/Products
   $ darcs get http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki
   $ zopectl restart

In ZMI you should be able to add a plain ZWiki web site:

1) choose "ZWiki" in the select list (upper left corner of page)
   and click "Add",
2) choose and Id and Title (e.g. plainwiki),
3) click "Create Wiki"

This should allow you to create and edit vanilla wiki pages.

http://localhost:9673/plainwiki

Verify that this works!
------

Now it gets a little harder. :)

The second goal should be to add the LatexWiki extensions. This
is described quite well at Bob McElrath's web site:

http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki

See

http://mcelrath.org/Notes/INSTALL

Notice especially the requirements for the installation of
related packages. Again Debian makes this quite easy:

  apt-get install tetex-base tetex-bin tetex-extra gs zope \
    python2.4-imaging

To install LatexWiki itself try this:

     cd /home/LatexW
     darcs get http://bob.mcelrath.org/darcs/latexwiki
     cd /var/lib/zope2.8/instance/zope1/Products
     cp -r /home/LatexW/latexwiki/LatexWiki .
     cp -r /home/LatexW/latexwiki/ZWiki .

Since Bob is no longer maintaining an LatexWiki in sync with the
latest version of ZWiki, you might experience some problems getting
LatexWiki to work properly with the current version of ZWiki. If
you get to this stage, I am willing to try to help and if we get
stuck again then we can probably bug Bob McElrath for more help.

At this point you should be able to add a ZWiki of Type:

  (*) LatexWiki

1) choose "ZWiki" in the select list (upper left corner of page)
   and click "Add",
2) choose and Id and Title (e.g. latexwiki)
3) click the Type (*) latexwiki, and then
4) click "Create Wiki"

It should be capable of displaying LaTeX symbols and equations.

http://localhost:9673/latexwiki

Verify that this works!
------

Finally, the hardest part. Te-read the instructions at:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/InstallingMathAction

Keep in mind that these instructions are a little out of date.
You have already done Step 1 above.

For the newest version of ZWiki I suggest the following variation
on Step 2:

     cd /home/AxiomW
     darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/latexwiki

     cd /var/lib/zope2.8/instance/zope1/Products/ZWiki

     cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/ReplaceInline* .
     cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/*Wrapper.py .
     cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/texbreaker* .
     cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/useproto.h .

Be sure to make the specified edits as appropriate to your
configuration.

Then finally you should be able to

1) restart Zope.
2) In ZMI add another ZWiki object
   with Id and Title (e.g. axiomwiki)
   click the Type (*) latexwiki, and then
   click "Create Wiki".
3) Acess it at http://localhost:9673/axiomwiki
   (Or just use the 'latexwiki' from your previous test.)
4) Create a new wiki page or edit an existing one and choose
   page type "Pamphlet".
5) Within that page you should be able to do pamphlets

   \documentclass ... \end{document}

   and all of the usual LatexWiki "structured text + latex"
   things plus the axiom/spad/aldor/boot/lisp commands:

   \begin{axiom} ... \end{axiom}

Verify that this works!

It is possible for me to export the current contents of the
Axiom Wiki site in a way that would allow it to be imported
into a local version of mathaction. The contents however is
already quite large (about 200 Mbytes or so) and nearly 500
pages. Maybe it would be better to move only a few selected
pages at first. This can be done by the same export and import
procedure (by wiki manager) or by simple cut-and-paste from
the edit page of Axiom Wiki to the edit page on the local wiki
(by any user).

Concerning export and import, there is a small complication of
the generated png image files that represent the LaTeX output.
These are not actually stored in the Zope object store (data
base) but rather in a special directory in the file system. If
we wanted to make a complete copy of the current contents of
Axiom Wiki, we must also include these files. However given the
data exported from the database it is possible to regenerate
the image files locally by running the upgradeall command. If
the desire is to re-create the entire contents of Axiom Wiki,
this could take a long time since the local system would have
to run Axiom and LaTeX on every page.

As you can see below, I am trying to use the zope-2.8, python-2.4,
and the "darcs" versions of both ZWiki and LatexWiki.

I have been testing my LatexWiki installation procedure on
Debian as outlined below. All goes well (with modifications
of recipe inserted below) but when I get to the point of
wanting to create my first ZWiki of Type: (*) latexwiki, I
find that I do not have this option in the ZWiki Add form.

In spite of that, I do have the ...+Latex pagetypes when
I try to edit a page. It seems as if something in the product
initialization has failed, but I do not see any error messages
when I have 'debug-mode on' and use 'runzope'.

Can you give me some ideas about what to try?

This is where the procedure fails since I do not have the

The files necessary for this latexwiki installation option are in
ZWiki/content/latexwiki.  Depending on how you installed ZWiki, you may
need to link this directory from the latexwiki installation.  The
LatexWiki darcs repository has both a LatexWiki and ZWiki directory,
both of which should go in Products/.  (The ZWiki directory adds the
ZWiki/content/latexwiki stuff)

Let me know if that works.

I'm sorry if I've missed emails on this, all my axiom email ends up in
an axiom folder that I've been too busy to read lately... :(  (send a
private email if you really want to get my attention)

I think it would be a good idea to set up a separate ZWiki+LatexWiki
distribution, rather than pulling and patching from my darcs repository.
Undoubtedly that route is difficult right now due to changes in ZWiki.

Hmmm.... It is hard to for me to know what to suggest for this one.
I need more information.

What do you mean exactly by "blank"? Are the expected headers there?
Like 'pdf' 'dvi' .. 'log' ? (The 'log' link should display the log
output from LaTeX if LaTeX actually gets run.)

One thing you can do is take a look in your

  $ZopeInstance/var/LatexWiki

directory. This is where you will find the png images files generated
by LaTeX/ghostscript and also the .tex file (output of noweave) and
other related files. These should be generated when you click 'Save'.
Please let me know what you find there.

Actually this is encouraging because it means that Axiom has run
and internally produced some LaTeX output. Now MathAction is trying
to run the program that splits long long math output into multiple
lines.

This is a new issue. Line 5 of 'texbreaker.py' is:

  import _texbreaker

The Python error message is telling you that it can't find the
line breaking library '_texbreaker.so' which is normally built by
the script 'texbreaker.mak'. See step 5b) in
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/InstallingMathAction

Perhaps you forget this step?

AFAIU the claim is that Axiom integrator will do one of the following:

1) give elementary integral
2) prove that elementary integral does not exist
3) give error message about unimplemented branch of the Risch algorithm
4) run out of resources

This claim is both in detailed Axiom documentation and in Bronstein post
to sci.math.symbolic. 

Risch algorithm in Axiom do have unimplemented branches, the following
is an example:

integrate(D(exp(-a*sqrt(1 - b*cos(theta)))/(a+b+theta), [theta], [1]), theta)

result:

   >> Error detected within library code:
   Function not supported by Risch d.e.

I doubt that just finishing the implementation will give much improvement.
Namely, the unimplemented cases have huge resource requirements, so 
implementing them is likely to lead to case 4 above.

I think that one can gain more by implementing a bunch of shortcuts
(like the reduction I show in my answer to Bob McElrath) to handle
common "textbook" cases.

I think that should work. I usually use 'dselect'. I found 'swig' there.

Can't you simply change texbreaker.mak? Or does it work for some good
reason with python2.3 on your machine?

Well, it would be easier if one does not have to modify files like
ReplaceInlineLatex.py or axiomWrapper.py.

Wouln't it also be an option to provide a dummy "reduce" script which
accepts some (Reduce) input and always outputs a string in Reduce
format, saying that Reduce is not installed. Could you provide such a
shell script?

Ehm, maybe I don't understand MathAction correctly. What I actually want 
is a snapshot of the MathAction pages. And if I could have all the 
functionality of running Axiom through a local webserver (without 
actually being connected to the internet then all the better. The 
SnapShot that Bill Page provided as an archive of HTML pages is not 
completely satisfactory.

I followed the steps at http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/InstallingMathAction
where it finally says:
6) Restart zope: /etc/init.d/zope restart

Of course, I have installed zope before. 'apt-get install zope' should 
do for debian sarge.

/etc/init.d/zope restart

has to be called as 'root'. And did not give me any return message.

Does not work. I see a page in FireFox:

Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at localhost:8080.

Hmm, this sounds as if I get MathAction without the same content I see

I have to admit that it's pretty complicated to get everything
just right. One thing I need to do is provide more useful error
and debugging output.

I updated the MathAction repository with some improvements to
'ReplacePamphlet.py' and 'pamphletWrapper.py' so that the
generate proper error messages.

You should use

  cd <your repository>
  darcs pull

to get these updates.

Python 2.2 is rather old. We have been using python2.3
for almost 2 years on MathAction. The current version is
Python 2.4 and I hope to upgrade MathAction to this new
version real-soon-now. The newer versions of Zope require
at least Python 2.3 and run better/faster with 2.4. You
can find Python 2.4 and newer versions of Zope on
Debian/testing. But if all you want to get is a basic
running system, then following the old recipe should be
ok.

Agreed.

It should not be necessary to have Reduce installed
provided that you do not try to run any \begin{reduce} ...
commands. Perhaps the current code does not check, but
it should not even try unless it sees \begin{reduce}.
If it does, then please let me know the error message
and I will try to make corrections to the code.

MathAction is an interactive web site. The content is
created by the users over the web. It is stored in a
database on the server and presented to the user as
ordinary web pages (with the option to edit and comment).
When MathAction is run locally, your computer acts as
both the server and the workstation. Since MathAction can
interact with Axiom (and other systems), this means that
you can use a locally running MathAction system as a user
interface to Axiom. This user interface allows you to
save "Axiom worksheets" as web pages in a manner similar
to the way you can save worksheets in Mathematical and
Maple.

In what way is it not satisfactory? Do you mean because it is
not "live"? Of course it consists of only a "snapshot" of
what tha pages on MathAction were like on the day that the
snapshot was taken. It is only pure, dead HTML. No interaction
is possible - only navigation from one page to another.

The commands above are for a "newer" version of Zope - the
version 2.7 of Zope that we are using on MathAction.

This is for an older version of Zope. But it should work
anyway.

Yes, this should be ok. But you should check the zope
configuration file (look in a directory for a file name
something like ...zope/etc/zope.conf. If you can't find
it easily then just examine

  cat /etc/init.d/zope

There should be an environment variable that points to the
configuration file. Or in older versions of Zope this was
just passed as an internal parameter in the above script.

If zope is running you should be able to see 'python' in the

  ps -A

or 'top' process list. If there is one or more active 'python'
processes, then the problem is likely that you have the wrong
port number. Please check the configuration file for the exact
port number.

If you want (or might be necessary on some systems if the
default port is already used for some other purpose), then
you can edit the configuration file and change the default
port to what you want. Usually a 4 digit number close to 8080
should be ok and only accessible locally if you have even a
simple firewall. If you have an aggressive firewall on your
workstation you might have to configure your firewall to
allow the use of the port that you choose. On a default
Debian Sarge installation this should be no problem.

It would be a very good idea for you to get the command:

  http://localhost:<portnumber>

to work before you add the LatexWiki and Axiom Wiki components.

That is correct. You would start with an empty wiki with
a default FrontPage that does not look much at all like
MathAction. But if all goes well, it should have the same
*functionality" as MathAction.

> Where is this content?

The content of the wiki is stored in the Zope database.

> And where could I download it from for offline use?

Once you have your own local MathAction running on your
workstation, you can use the "import" function in the
Zope Management Interface (ZMI) to load content that has
been "exported" from axiom-developer.org MathAction site.

You can also use "cut-and-paste" from one edit widows
(axiom-developer.org) to another edit window (localhost).

I hope this is clear. But if not please continue to ask
about this.

Yes! It is possible for you to do this. In fact I think it would
be really great to have more such "mirrors". So far only Bob
McElrath has done this, with my encouragement, as a means to
backup the contents of the MathAction website. He did it initially
about 6 months ago (September 2005) and I think he has done irregular
updates of his local copy of the MathAction zope database a few times
since then.

You can use rsync to maintain a strict mirror of the MathAction
site, but re-sync'ing local content with the "official" database
is not quite so simple because of the need to merge potentially
conflicting changes, but there is a specific Zope product called
Zsyncer which is supposed to make this possible:

http://www.zope.org/Members/slinkp/zsyncer_0-7-0
http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsyncer

So far, Bob McElrath and I have only done some initial experiments
with this. If/when you get your local copy of MathAction working,
I would be glad to continue research this possibility.

Thanks.

I am a little worried about the complications regarding the
location of the Zope products and the access permissions to
the Zope instance that you created. I have always installed all
Zope products into the 'instance' directory, which in your case
would be

  /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/Products

although older versions of Zope did do this differently.

I recommend that you leave the access permissions the same as
when the instance was created, but instead make sure that the
directory, subdirectories and files are owned by the same user
that runs Zope, e.g. check

  ls -l -d /var/lib/zope2.7/instance

then change the owner and group to match the above

I have never used the Debian zope-zwiki package

  apt-get install zope-zwiki

Apparently it installs Zwiki-0.37 but in an odd location. I note

zope-zwiki_0.37.0 compatibility --Simon Michael, Thu, 01 Dec 2005
18:36:36 -0800 reply Hi.. I don't recommend you use the zope-zwiki
package in debian - as you can see from it's last modified date,
and http://zwiki.org , it's way out of date. Download from zwiki.org
instead. Do please bug the debian package maintainer about this.
-------

ZWiki-0.37 is about 1 year old (the current version is 0.48. See

http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki/releases

But on the other hand, the last stable version of LatexWiki is 0.35
and it is known to work with at least the corresponding version
number of Zwiki-0.35

http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki

Since Bob has stopped actively maintaining LatexWiki, it might be
easiest (at least to get the first running a system) to work with
these known versions:

http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki/releases/ZWiki-0.35.0.tgz

http://mcelrath.org/LatexWiki-0.35.tar.gz

I suggest that you remove zope-zwiki

  /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl stop
  apt-get remove zope-zwiki

and then untar Zwiki-0.35 directly into the Products directory

  cd /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/Products
  wget http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki/releases/ZWiki-0.35.0.tgz
  tar xzvf ZWiki-0.35.0.tgz
  chown -R zope:zope *
  /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl start

Test that you can create a plainwiki in ZMI

  http://localhost:9673/manage

Now install LatexWiki in the same place

  /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl stop
  cd /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/Products
  wget http://mcelrath.org/LatexWiki-0.35.tar.gz
  tar xzvf LatexWiki-0.35.tar.gz
  mv latexwiki/*
  rm latexwiki
  chown -R zope:zope *
  /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl start

The mv and rm are necessary because the contents of the sub-
directory ZWiki in the LatexWiki tarball is intended to be
merged into the existing ZWiki directory. And the LatexWiki
sub-directory is really the LatexWiki product itself.

Unfortunately this does not give any very useful information. The
problem in ExternalMethod might have something to do with the none
standard zope-zwiki installation and/or access permissions.

To check the error log go to ZMI

  http://localhost:9673/manage

and click on 'error_log'. Then click on the link under Exception.
You can send me the contents of what you see when you click
'Display traceback as text'. It should be a little more complete
than the traceback that you sent above.

On the other hand, if re-installing as I suggest above works,
this is probably unnecessary.

I don't understand this.  If it isn't open source for everyone, it
isn't open source.  (I'm guessing open source will also mean free.)
So what would the individual basis be?

Yes! Please write to Steven Watt. I think it would definitely
help if it is clear to Steven that many people would like to
have Aldor open source. Maybe what we need is a kind of
"petition" that people could "sign" and email to him. I fear
that perhaps Steven does not take my claims that this is
desired by many people very seriously.

Perhaps a Steven Watt is not entirely clear on the concept of
"open source" (I think a lot of people continue to be confused
about this.) but what I understood by this was that, yes he
is planning to make Aldor available as open source in the way
that most people mean it, e.g. with a GPL, BSD-style or even
IBM's new CPL license. This would make Aldor easily available
to everyone.

But since Steven says he anticipates that it would take some
time to do this (The precise reason for the delay is not clear
since I thought the decision was basically just his to make.),
then he was telling me that he was willing to consider my
earlier request for a individual Aldor developer license to
me personally, as an interim measure. Aldor has been "freely"
available to researches in this manner on the basis of individual
requests since it was release to Steven Watt by Numerical
Algorithms Group in about 2001.

In another email I agreed to the individual license, but still
I have not heard from him about either the open source license
or the individual license.

How is such a petition made?  Web-based, or an email that many people
agree to have their names on?  If the former, there are several online
petition hosting sites (such as www.petitiononline.com and
www.thepetitionsite.com) but it might be better to have something
easily signable on the Axiom website; if the latter, put my name on it
(and I could write something if you want).

Hmm.  What about the other option, to go "back to the source" so to
speak - NAG?  Or does Stephen now have full rights to all Aldor code
now?

Of course, there is the third option of doing Aldor ourselves starting
with the existing SPAD work.  Perhaps we will have to consider that,
even if it is a lot of work :-(.  It would be better than all serious
work being stalled waiting on a language decision.

What are the restrictions of that license, I wonder?  Are you allowed to
re-license it, or modify and share source?  What kind of restrictions
does it make wrt reverse-engineering, for something like a clean-room
reimplementation of it?  After having viewed it's source, are you
restricted from working on such a thing?  Is a rewrite a good idea, or
not?

I would be very glad if you could write something.

I am not sure whether a formal petition is really necessary (although
I have it very interesting to learn that websites devoted to the
purpose actually exist ... :)

The Axiom website is a wiki (user editable), so it would be very
easy to add a page consisting of the petition to Free Aldor. We
could freeze the text and then readers could "sign" it by simply
adding a comment.

Having never actually seen the "source license" for Aldor, I can
not answer this question directly, but the rational for the binary
license for Aldor

http://www.aldor.org/license-rationale.html

"The fourth clause is present for two reasons:

    * Parts of the existing code base in the software package that
this license is applied to require Aldor.org to make any updates
available to the initial contributors. The clause is there to give
Aldor.org the right to do this.
    * It reserves for major contributors, through Aldor.org, greater
flexibility to create and exploit potential future software based on
this work, and protects them where they have existing non-open software
that is related to or shares some code with this work.

No, I don't think that is the intention. The binary license, at least,
is not a non-disclosure agreement.

I believe that rewriting is way beyond the scope of what is currently
possible with the resource currently available to the open source
Axiom project.

I would never do such a thing.  I consider it harassment and very
childish.

I have the greatest respect (and recognition) for people contributing
to free software by putting the software they have rights on under any
free software license.  If Steven Watt belongs to such people is his
own choice (if even he has such a choice) and I respect everybody's
choice whatever is this choice.

I am very sad for people from the Axiom community to give such a
message as `we have such a good free software that we are willing to
drop it for an other replacement, please open source this possible
substitute'.

Thanks Tim and other contributors for the impressive work already
achieved.  Keep up the good work and happy new year.

Best regards,
Frederic

Aldor is a conceptual heir of SPAD, and fixes some known problems with
the SPAD language.  Since part of Axiom's philosophy is to do things
RIGHT, it makes sense to want to use the most advanced form of the
language available, if in fact it IS available.  We can and will work
with SPAD if we need to, but if a better alternative exists it is
logical to pursue it until it is clear that that option is not
available.  Either case is acceptable, but there is a hesitancy about
doing major work on the math part of Axiom until it is clear which
language we will be using.  I tend to think of Axiom in the same way I
think of TeX - it is attempting to become EXTREMELY high quality
software, in every way.  Aldor would presumably aid us in that goal. 
But, at least for my part, if I am going to learn a new language I
would like to know which one to focus on from the get-go.

How odd that you think this way! How is someone like Steven Watt
to know that there are many people who are anxious to use his
work if we do not tell him? I do not consider it harrassment
that I have sent emails asking about the state of the plans
to make Aldor open source at the rate of about one 1 email/phone
call per month since September.

Of course I agree 100% with you. I also have the greatest respect
for Steven Watt and the other developers of Aldor. I do respect
his choice. Already the binary version of Aldor is freely available.
This arrangement for Aldor was made more than 5 years ago at a
time before the concept of open source was well defined. I am quite
sure that that is the only reason why Aldor is not already open
source. I think what is left is only to over come the inertia of
making the necessary arrangements. No doubt this coupled with a
busy research schedule has not yet allowed anyone to given
priority to making the status of the Aldor source code clear.

>

I think you do not understand. Aldor *is* (at least was) a part
of Axiom. It was designed as "version 2" of the Axiom library
compiler during the latter stages of Axiom research at IBM.
Steven Watt was one of the primary developers. When Axiom was
a commercial product sold by NAG, Aldor was included in the
package.

When NAG discontinued the sale of Axiom, Aldor was the first part
of the system that was made publically available (in binary form)
through "aldor.org" which as I understand it, was the initiative
of Steven Watt. At the time apparently no one wanted to take on
the responsibility for making the rest of Axiom available. It was
a few years later when Tim Daly made the necessary arrangements
to open source the rest of Axiom, but the previous arrangments for
the Aldor part were already in force.

So what we are really talking about is finding a way to re-unite
the two part of Axiom as a single open source project (or at least
two closely related open source projects).

I think there's a misunderstanding here.
There is a big difference between one person waiting and a community
of people waiting for something.  Letting Steven Watt know that there
is a community waiting for a potential relicensing of Aldor is
not only a reasonable thing to do, it could be argued that not letting
him know would be a disservice to Axiom.  I think it goes without
saying that anything sent to him would be friendly and cordial.

Nobody is suggesting it isn't his choice.  That doesn't mean we can't
respectfully ask that he make a particular choice.

This is an improvement, not a replacement, for Axiom.  I think
the only message being sent is that we want to improve Axiom as much
as possible.

So that any potential signers could get a quick grasp of the
situation, a little history might be useful.  What about
something like:

   Axiom is a sophisticated computer algebra system originally
   developed by the the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG).  After NAG
   discontinued work on Axiom, they generously released the source
   code under a free license.  Axiom is now very usable and is
   currently being actively developed by an enthusiastic community.
   It is expected to be useful in research and education for quite
   some time.

   The language used for writing Axiom programs is called SPAD (short
   for Scratchpad, the original name of Axiom).  While Axiom was still
   being developed by NAG, an improved extension language called Aldor
   was created. While the Aldor compiler was originally part of the
   Axiom system, it soon became a separate project and was not part of
   Axiom when the Axiom sources were relicensed.

   Binaries for Aldor have been made freely available and the sources
   are available under a generous license.  However, the license does
   not qualify as a free or open source license.  While Axiom can
   still be built using Aldor, the lack of a free license for Aldor
   prohibits it from being a standard part of Axiom, and so nothing in
   the base Axiom system can assume that Aldor is included.

   A free license for Aldor would allow it to become a standard part
   of Axiom, which would improve Axiom and make Aldor a more
   widespread language.  A free license available as soon as possible
   would allow current development on Axiom to use Aldor.

   We, the undersigned, respectfully request that the Aldor compiler
   be released under a free license at the earliest opportunity.

   Sincerely,

> I am not sure whether a formal petition is really necessary (although

Quite a few, too.
A formal petition probably isn't necessary, but something to let

That might not be a bad idea.  We would have to get Steven Watt to
look at it, of course.

Axiom was actually developed as an IBM research project. It
was sold to NAG with the intention that NAG would market it
commercially, which they did for a few years. NAG also made
some improvements and developed and marketed a PC version. (The
PC versions depended on software called texplorer which
was separately licensed and not available to at the time
Axiom became open source.)

Aldor was written while Axiom was still an IBM research project.
SPAD and Aldor are only used to write Axiom library code - not
Axiom per se. Axiom and the SPAD compiler are written in Lisp.
Aldor is written in C.

As I understand it, Aldor did not exist as a separate project until
after NAG discontinued the sale of Axiom as a commercial product.

Ok, unless someone has serious objections, I think we can post a
revision of a letter such as you wrote above on the Axiom wiki.

Yes, I think that is exactly the case.

Thanks for the additional information.  I've fixed the inaccuracies,

   Axiom is a sophisticated computer algebra system originally
   developed as an IBM research project.  IBM sold Axiom to the
   Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) who marketed it and continued its
   development.  After NAG discontinued Axiom as a commercial product
   they generously released part of the Axiom source code under a free
   license.  Axiom is now very usable and is currently being actively
   developed by an enthusiastic community. It is expected to be useful
   in research and education for quite some time.

   The language used for writing Axiom libraries is called SPAD (short
   for Scratchpad, the original name of Axiom).  While Axiom was still
   being developed by IBM, an improved language, Aldor, was created
   for writing Axiom libraries.  While the Aldor compiler was
   originally part of the Axiom system, it was became a separate
   project when NAG discontinued the sale of Axiom as a commercial
   product.  The Aldor compiler was not part of Axiom when the Axiom
   sources were relicensed, and so is not currently included with Axiom.

   Binaries for Aldor have been made freely available and the sources
   are available under a generous license.  However, the license does
   not qualify as a free or open source license.  While Axiom can
   still be built using Aldor, the lack of a free license for Aldor
   prohibits it from being a standard part of Axiom, and so nothing in
   the base Axiom system can assume that Aldor is included.

   A free license for Aldor would allow it to become a standard part
   of Axiom, which would improve Axiom and make Aldor a more
   widespread language.  A free license available as soon as possible
   would allow current development on Axiom to use Aldor.

   We, the undersigned, respectfully request that the Aldor compiler
   be released under a free license at the earliest opportunity.

+\item In order to get the latest source for the Axiom main line type: 
 \begin{verbatim}
-What is MinGW?
+$ tla get axiom--main--1
+\end{verbatim}
 
-  MinGW ("Minimalistic GNU for Windows") refers to a set of runtime headers, 
-used in building a compiler system based on the GNU GCC and binutils projects. 
-It compiles and links code to be run on Win32 platforms... providing C, C++ and 
-Fortran compilers plus other related tools. If you see references to "mingw32" 
-instead of "MinGW", they are referring to the same compiler system. The 
-project's name changed from mingw32 to MinGW is to prevent the implication that 
-MinGW will only works on 32 bit systems (as 64 and higher bit machines become 
-more common, MinGW will evolve to work with them). MinGW uses the Microsoft 
-runtime libraries, distributed with the Windows operating system. Unlike other 
-ports of GCC to Windows, the runtime libraries are not distributed using Gnu's 
-General Public License (GPL). You, therefore, do not have to distribute your 
-source code with your programs unless, of course, you use a GPL library in your 
-programs.
+\item Now you can change the sources. In order to commit the changes
+  you need to create a log file that summarizes the changes. You can
+  create and edit the log file using:
+\begin{verbatim}
+$ emacs `tla make-log`
+\end{verbatim}
 
-What is MSYS?
+\item Finally you commit the changes with: 
+\begin{verbatim}
+$ tla commit
+\end{verbatim}
+\end{itemize}
 
-  MSYS or Minimal SYStem is a POSIX and Bourne shell environment use with 
-MinGW. It provides a hand picked set of tools to allow a typical configuration 
-script with Bourne syntax to execute. This allows most of the GNU packages to 
-create a Makefile just from executing the typical configure script which can 
-then be used to build the package using the native MinGW version of GCC.
 
-The POSIX layer used by MSYS is a fork of the 1.3.3 version of Cygwin . Cygwin 
-is a full POSIX layer and UNIX-like environment for Win32 providing both server 
-and client utilites.

+\section{Coding Guidelines}
+\label{sec:CodingGuidelines}
 
+Code in Axiom tries to follow certain guidelines, which aim to improve
+readability and the documentation of the implementation.
 
-I've attached the interesting part of a console log. At this point
-the Axiom build is making the transition from building the BOOTSTRAP
-algebra to building the non-BOOTSTRAP algebra.
+Unfortunately many of these guidelines have only been applied since
+Axiom became available under an open source license on September 3,
+2002. Hence many parts of Axiom do not follow these guidelines at all
+or only superficially\footnote{For example, all source files have been
+  converted to pamphlet files. In general, though, they are not
+  documented or structured in any useful way, yet. They simply contain
+  one big chunk of code.}. If you gained understanding of an as-yet
+undocumented part of Axiom, please document and edit it according to
+these guidelines and submit a patch to the maintainers of Axiom (see
+\ref{sec:ContributingPatches}).
 
-Notice that the BOOTSTRAP algebra is just lisp code. This code is 
-compiled in a DEPSYS image so that macros are properly expanded.
-However it is clear that the BOOTSTRAP lisp code was not compiled by
-the "new" compiler.
+\subsection{General}
+\label{sec:CodingGuidelinesGeneral}
 
-Next we see the transition to compiling the non-BOOTSTRAP algebra.
-This is done in the interpsys image. It is also done in an image 
-that has access to only the BOOTSTRAP algebra code. Thus the 
-new compiler might not have all of the algebra-defined replacements
-available at compile time. Notice the autoload files that contain
-the optimizations.
 
-A second or third round of compiles will expose the algebra-based
-optimizations and these will be compiled into the code. Since these
-are only optimizations the final results should not be affected.
+\begin{quotation}
+  Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only
+  incidentally for machines to execute.
 
-Also note that the BOOTSTRAP algebra is recompiled as the last step
-of building the algebra from scratch so that it can use the circular
-definitions.

+Naturally the workflow varies between developers, but usually there
+are some common elements. In this section we describe a somewhat
+rudimentary workflow for developing Axiom\footnote{The rest of this
+  section is mostly an edited version of an email by Tim Daly, in
+  which he describes how he develops \axiom{}. His workflow is rudimentary in the
+  sense that he uses almost none of Emacs' advanced features.}.
 
+The most important thing in programming is the "OODA" loop (it means
+"orient-observe-decide-act") which, in programming, refers to the
+issue of how long it takes to fix a bug.

-The BOOTSTRAP files contain lsp and spad code. The build steps
-for the initial BOOTSTRAP layer use "depsys" to compile the lisp
-code. So, in this case, we see VECTOR.lsp being compiled in the

-VECTOR.spad will be compiled and replaces the lisp. However the

+\label{sec:Processes}
 
-Because I grabbed the wrong version of .lsp file for BOOTSTRAP
-code you are able to see this difference. The work you and steve
-are doing is to find stable versions of the .lsp files.
+A running \axiom{} consists of several different processes, depending on
+the user's actions. \axiom{} is usually started using the {\tt
+  \$AXIOM/src/etc/axiom} shellscript, which does some option
+processing and then starts {\tt sman}.

-> But it could have an impact on overall performance, right?
+% TODO: Detail the processes
 
-Oh, clearly. (QSADD1 ... ...) is faster than (+ ... ...)
 
-Furthermore, there is another optimization step we could take
-during the build but we do not (yet). When the GCL compiler
-compiles VECTOR.lsp it generates VECTOR.fn. If you look in these
-.fn files you'll find exact type information for each function call.
+\section{Languages}
+\label{sec:Languages}
 
-VECTOR.lsp -> VECTOR.o + VECTOR.fn (unoptimized, but type generated)
+%TODO kai: How do we integrate
+%http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomDevelopment?
 
-If this exact type information was available at compile time then
-the GCL compiler can lay down faster code. However there is a 
-bootstrap problem here also since the GCL compiler has to compile
-the code one time in order to generate the .fn file.
+Axiom is built using several different (programming) languages, some
+of which are undocumented. This section gives a short description of
+each language as well as its uses. More detailed information on these
+languages can usually be found in other chapters of this book.
 
-VECTOR.lsp + VECTOR.fn -> VECTOR.o (type optimized)
 
-So the full, proper procedure, which I have yet to do, would actually
-call the GCL compile once to generate the .fn file with exact type
-information for function calls, load the .fn file, and the recompile
-the lisp file. Since the second compile has exact type information 
-the generated code will be (potentially much) shorter.
+\subsection{BOOT}
+\label{sec:BOOT}
 
-For each lisp file do
-(
-  VECTOR.lsp -> VECTOR.o + VECTOR.fn (unoptimized, but type generated)
-  VECTOR.lsp + VECTOR.fn -> VECTOR.o (type optimized)
-)
+\boot{} is what most of the \spad{} interpreter/compiler is written
+in. It is implemented in Lisp and \boot{} itself, which introduces
+some bootstrap issues. \boot{} programs are compiled to Lisp and then
+compiled and executed by the Lisp system. The source code to the
+\boot{} compiler can be found in {\tt \$AXIOM/src/boot}.

-I have to think about this (I'm getting ready for work so I'll
-give it some "drive-time cycles") but I believe that the issue
-is related to using fresh databases. The databases are used 
-during the algebra compiles to resolve algebra calls. However
-recompiling the algebra generates NRLIBs and, from these NRLIBs 
-a fresh database is built thus:
+\subsection{Lisp}
+\label{sec:Lisp}
 
-DATABASES -> NRLIBs -> FRESH DATABASES
+The use of Lisp in \axiom{} is pervasive but somewhat peculiar. This
+stems mostly from two facts. First of all, during its lifetime \axiom{} has been ported to
+many different Lisps. Furthermore Lisp is mostly used as a low-level
+language and only very rudimentary Lisp features are used.
 
-This is yet a third bootstrap issue. There are more but not with
-the algebra files.
+Currently \axiom{} runs on GNU Common Lisp in CLtL1 mode. There is an
+effort to port it to GCL's ANSI mode and other standard-compliant
+Lisps, like SBCL and CMUCL.
 
-\end{verbatim}
-\section{email 9}
-\begin{verbatim}
-Yet one other opportunity for speed optimization is available at 
-build time....
+The Lisp code in Axiom is distributed over several packages, which are
+defined in {\tt \$AXIOM/src/interp/sys-pkg.lisp.pamphlet}.
+% TODO kai: There are several dead Lisp packages in the list
+% below. Why do we keep them around?
 
-Remember that every lisp file generates a .fn file:
+\begin{itemize}
+\item {\tt SCRATCHPAD\_COMPILER}
 
-foo.lsp -> foo.o + foo.fn
+  The \spad{} compiler package (probably dead, all symbols have been
+  moved to the {\tt BOOT} package).
 
-and that a second compile with the .fn file loaded is faster:
+\item {\tt SPECFNSF}
 
-foo.lsp + foo.fn -> faster foo.o
+  The special functions package (dead). There was originally Lisp
+  code to support hardcoded knowledge of special functions like {\tt
+    gamma}. The functions in this package have been lifted to the
+  algebra level.
 
-However if we look at the type information in the foo.fn file
-we find that it only contains type information for functions
-defined in foo.lsp. But suppose there are two lisp files with
-functions from one using functions from the other. The sub-optimal
-sequence is:
+\item {\tt VMLISP}
 
-foo.lsp -> foo.o + foo.fn
-foo.lsp + foo.fn -> faster foo.o
+  This package originally contained the VMLisp macros but in fact
+  contains macros to support several other Lisps. It is essentially
+  the place where most of the macros to support idioms from prior
+  ports are, e.g. {\tt RDEFIOSTREAM} and {\tt FILEACTQ}. In the long
+  term this package should probably go away, since \axiom{} is being
+  moved to \ansicl.
 
-bar.lsp -> bar.o + bar.fn
-bar.lsp + bar.fn -> faster bar.o
+\item {\tt BOOTTRAN}
 
-The optimal sequence is:
+  This is the \boot{} to Lisp compiler package used by the files in {\tt
+    \$AXIOM/src/boot}. It is the \boot{} translator package.
 
-foo.lsp -> foo.o + foo.fn
-bar.lsp -> bar.o + bar.fn
+\item {\tt BOOT}
 
-foo.lsp + (foo.fn + bar.fn) -> even faster foo.o
-bar.lsp + (foo.fn + bar.fn) -> even faster bar.o
+  Everything in Axiom that the user references eventually shows up
+  here. The interpreter and the algebra are run after switching to the
+  boot package {\tt (in-package "BOOT")}. Hence any symbol that the
+  interpreter or algebra uses has to appear here.
 
-So, really what we should do is cache ALL of the .fn files from all of
-the compiles, batch them into a big file, and the completely rebuild
-the system with the batched .fn files loaded.
+\item {\tt FOAM}
 
-I've started this process but have not yet completed it. 
-See the file src/boot/boot-proclaims.lisp
+  \foam{} is the intermediate language for the \aldor{} compiler. \foam{}
+  means ``First Order Abstract Machine'' and functions similar to RTL
+  for the GCC compiler. It is a "machine" that is used as the target
+  for meta-assembler level statements. These are eventually expanded
+  for the real target machine or interpreted directly.
 
-So there is a faster Axiom coming in the future but the build 
-complexity will be even greater. And Camm, I believe, is doing
-even more with type propagation which will improve things more.
+\item {\tt FOAM-USER}
 
+  {\tt foam-user} is the package containing foam statements and macros
+  that get inserted into user code versus the foam package which
+  provides support for compiler code.
+\end{itemize}
 
-\end{verbatim}
-\section{email 10}
-\begin{verbatim}
-I am no longer baffled. The explanation for the generic arith
-vs. fixnum arith is in macros.lisp. In the following code from
--REPEAT, X is bound to a form such as '((STEP |i| 3 1)):
 
-  (COND ((AND (EQ (CAAR X) 'STEP)
-                  (|member| (CADDAR X) '(2 1 0 (|One|) (|Zero|)))
-                  (|member| (CADR (CDDAR X)) '(1 (|One|))))
-             (SETQ X (CONS (CONS 'ISTEP (CDAR X)) (CDR X))) ))
-                        ; A hack to increase the likelihood of small integers
+\subsection{\spad}
+\label{sec:SPAD}
 
-So, one `rule' is, if you iterate with a sequence with lower bound
-0,1, or 2, with an increment of 1, you get fixnum arith. Otherwise you
-get generic arithmetic.
+\spad{} is the programming language for mathematics. All the code in
+{\tt \$AXIOM/src/algebra} is written in \spad. It is a user-level
+language. More detailed information on \spad{} can be found in the
+\manual{}.
 
-However, this is not a hard and fast rule, since the compiler can say
-'(ISTEP |i| 5 23) [say] during code generation and force fixnum arith. 
 
+\subsection{\aldor}
+\label{sec:Aldor}
 
-This leads to a question. Tim, in interp/wi2.boot we have a
-redefinition of compIterator (default implementation is in
-iterator.boot). This new definition makes an attempt at deciding when
-fixnum stepping code should be generated. Do you have an explanation
-as to why is this not the default definition? The original version of
-the code in iterator.boot is what gets called.
+\aldor{} is the successor of \spad. There are still remnants of \aldor
+support in the current codebase, but the only working implementation
+of \aldor{} is written in C and available at http://www.aldor.org/,
+unfortunately not under an open source license. There is some support
+for using that \aldor{} implementation with \axiom{} and it is planned to
+move all of \axiom{} to \aldor.
 
-I'm wondering if it is possible that during the fixedPoint build if
-some of the new definitions (particularly those in wi2.boot,
-xruncomp.boot) are being autoloaded during compilation. The changes
-which I have already noted in the generated lisp seem to support this
-(fixnum arith vs. generic arith, inlining of trivial coercions,
-etc). All the changes make sense if they are the result of calling one
-of the `improved' functions which these files redefine. 
+\subsection{\hypertex}
+\label{sec:Hypertex}
 
-Sincerely,
-Steve
+\hypertex{} is similar in appearance to \TeX/\LaTeX and is used by the
+\hyperdoc{} as a markup language. More information can be found in the
+chapter on \hyperdoc{} (see \ref{sec:TheHyperDoc}) and in \manual.

+What is MinGW?
 
+  MinGW ("Minimalistic GNU for Windows") refers to a set of runtime headers, 
+used in building a compiler system based on the GNU GCC and binutils projects. 
+It compiles and links code to be run on Win32 platforms... providing C, C++ and 
+Fortran compilers plus other related tools. If you see references to "mingw32" 
+instead of "MinGW", they are referring to the same compiler system. The 
+project's name changed from mingw32 to MinGW is to prevent the implication that 
+MinGW will only works on 32 bit systems (as 64 and higher bit machines become 
+more common, MinGW will evolve to work with them). MinGW uses the Microsoft 
+runtime libraries, distributed with the Windows operating system. Unlike other 
+ports of GCC to Windows, the runtime libraries are not distributed using Gnu's 
+General Public License (GPL). You, therefore, do not have to distribute your 
+source code with your programs unless, of course, you use a GPL library in your 
+programs.

+What is MSYS?
 
-Yep.
+  MSYS or Minimal SYStem is a POSIX and Bourne shell environment use with 
+MinGW. It provides a hand picked set of tools to allow a typical configuration 
+script with Bourne syntax to execute. This allows most of the GNU packages to 
+create a Makefile just from executing the typical configure script which can 
+then be used to build the package using the native MinGW version of GCC.
 
+The POSIX layer used by MSYS is a fork of the 1.3.3 version of Cygwin . Cygwin 
+is a full POSIX layer and UNIX-like environment for Win32 providing both server 
+and client utilites.

+I've attached the interesting part of a console log. At this point
+the Axiom build is making the transition from building the BOOTSTRAP
+algebra to building the non-BOOTSTRAP algebra.
 
-Fixed by the patch I send earlier (I hope)...
+Notice that the BOOTSTRAP algebra is just lisp code. This code is 
+compiled in a DEPSYS image so that macros are properly expanded.
+However it is clear that the BOOTSTRAP lisp code was not compiled by
+the "new" compiler.
 
+Next we see the transition to compiling the non-BOOTSTRAP algebra.
+This is done in the interpsys image. It is also done in an image 
+that has access to only the BOOTSTRAP algebra code. Thus the 
+new compiler might not have all of the algebra-defined replacements
+available at compile time. Notice the autoload files that contain
+the optimizations.
 
-> By the way, could you explain what your patches are doing? It's just a mystery
-> to me! I suspect that one needs some knowledge of Aldor internals?
+A second or third round of compiles will expose the algebra-based
+optimizations and these will be compiled into the code. Since these
+are only optimizations the final results should not be affected.
 
-The significant bit is removing an unbound variable from as.boot, the
-rest is to fix the )co command (obviously not bullet proof), and the .ap
-file generation.  
+Also note that the BOOTSTRAP algebra is recompiled as the last step
+of building the algebra from scratch so that it can use the circular
+definitions.
 
-In terms of aldor internal knowledge, you don't need that much, the hard
-work is on the axiom side. The trick is to load all the aldor runtime
-env interpreted and see what breaks (this includes daase.lisp, as.clisp
-& interop.clisp, plus the aldor .lsp files).  This stuff used to vaguely
-work, so putting it back in shape can't be too bad.  \end{verbatim}

+Personally, although I have tried knoppix and some variants on
+several occasions I have always been a little disappointed
+and frustrated. The problem is that I live in linux about 1/2
+the time and windows the other 1/2 and when I boot one of these
+"live" things I feel like I am in neither. It's fun to play for
+an hour or so but then it goes in the desk draw with all the
+other things that once fascinated me but I haven't looked at
+for so long that they are now collecting dust. So I am quite
+sceptical about the utility of a "live" Axiom/Doyen CD except
+as a kind of conference "promotional gimmick".

+Once we leave the phase (shown in the printout) we start using

+Due to my lack of foresight in choosing the VECTOR.lsp BOOTSTRAP

+VECTOR.lsp (BOOTSTRAP) uses SINT.o
 
-but I suspect that this is of no importance.

+Furthermore, there is another optimization step we could take

-------------------------------- Operations --------------------------------
- fact : PositiveInteger -> PositiveInteger
+VECTOR.lsp -> VECTOR.o + VECTOR.fn (unoptimized, but type generated)

+If this exact type information was available at compile time then

+So the full, proper procedure, which I have yet to do, would actually
+call the GCL compile once to generate the .fn file with exact type
+information for function calls, load the .fn file, and the recompile
+the lisp file. Since the second compile has exact type information 
+the generated code will be (potentially much) shorter.
 
+For each lisp file do
+(
+  VECTOR.lsp -> VECTOR.o + VECTOR.fn (unoptimized, but type generated)
+  VECTOR.lsp + VECTOR.fn -> VECTOR.o (type optimized)

-By the way, could you explain what your patches are doing? It's just a mystery
-to me! I suspect that one needs some knowledge of Aldor internals?
+I have to think about this (I'm getting ready for work so I'll
+give it some "drive-time cycles") but I believe that the issue
+is related to using fresh databases. The databases are used 
+during the algebra compiles to resolve algebra calls. However
+recompiling the algebra generates NRLIBs and, from these NRLIBs 
+a fresh database is built thus:

+
+This is yet a third bootstrap issue. There are more but not with
+the algebra files.
 
-There are further problems:
-- aldor "extend" does not work - it ought to, I think

+foo.lsp + (foo.fn + bar.fn) -> even faster foo.o

+So, really what we should do is cache ALL of the .fn files from all of

+
+I've started this process but have not yet completed it. 
+See the file src/boot/boot-proclaims.lisp
+
+So there is a faster Axiom coming in the future but the build

+
+Oh, clearly. (QSADD1 ... ...) is faster than (+ ... ...)
+
+Furthermore, there is another optimization step we could take
+during the build but we do not (yet). When the GCL compiler
+compiles VECTOR.lsp it generates VECTOR.fn. If you look in these
+.fn files you'll find exact type information for each function call.
+
+VECTOR.lsp -> VECTOR.o + VECTOR.fn (unoptimized, but type generated)
+
+If this exact type information was available at compile time then
+the GCL compiler can lay down faster code. However there is a 
+bootstrap problem here also since the GCL compiler has to compile
+the code one time in order to generate the .fn file.
+
+VECTOR.lsp + VECTOR.fn -> VECTOR.o (type optimized)
+
+So the full, proper procedure, which I have yet to do, would actually
+call the GCL compile once to generate the .fn file with exact type
+information for function calls, load the .fn file, and the recompile
+the lisp file. Since the second compile has exact type information 
+the generated code will be (potentially much) shorter.
+
+For each lisp file do
+(
+  VECTOR.lsp -> VECTOR.o + VECTOR.fn (unoptimized, but type generated)
+  VECTOR.lsp + VECTOR.fn -> VECTOR.o (type optimized)
+)

+
+I have to think about this (I'm getting ready for work so I'll
+give it some "drive-time cycles") but I believe that the issue
+is related to using fresh databases. The databases are used 
+during the algebra compiles to resolve algebra calls. However
+recompiling the algebra generates NRLIBs and, from these NRLIBs 
+a fresh database is built thus:
+
+DATABASES -> NRLIBs -> FRESH DATABASES
+
+This is yet a third bootstrap issue. There are more but not with
+the algebra files.

+Yet one other opportunity for speed optimization is available at 
+build time....
+
+Remember that every lisp file generates a .fn file:
+
+foo.lsp -> foo.o + foo.fn
+
+and that a second compile with the .fn file loaded is faster:
+
+foo.lsp + foo.fn -> faster foo.o
+
+However if we look at the type information in the foo.fn file
+we find that it only contains type information for functions
+defined in foo.lsp. But suppose there are two lisp files with
+functions from one using functions from the other. The sub-optimal
+sequence is:
+
+foo.lsp -> foo.o + foo.fn
+foo.lsp + foo.fn -> faster foo.o
+
+bar.lsp -> bar.o + bar.fn
+bar.lsp + bar.fn -> faster bar.o
+
+The optimal sequence is:
+
+foo.lsp -> foo.o + foo.fn
+bar.lsp -> bar.o + bar.fn
+
+foo.lsp + (foo.fn + bar.fn) -> even faster foo.o
+bar.lsp + (foo.fn + bar.fn) -> even faster bar.o
+
+So, really what we should do is cache ALL of the .fn files from all of
+the compiles, batch them into a big file, and the completely rebuild
+the system with the batched .fn files loaded.
+
+I've started this process but have not yet completed it. 
+See the file src/boot/boot-proclaims.lisp
+
+So there is a faster Axiom coming in the future but the build 
+complexity will be even greater. And Camm, I believe, is doing
+even more with type propagation which will improve things more.

+I am no longer baffled. The explanation for the generic arith
+vs. fixnum arith is in macros.lisp. In the following code from
+-REPEAT, X is bound to a form such as '((STEP |i| 3 1)):
+
+  (COND ((AND (EQ (CAAR X) 'STEP)
+                  (|member| (CADDAR X) '(2 1 0 (|One|) (|Zero|)))
+                  (|member| (CADR (CDDAR X)) '(1 (|One|))))
+             (SETQ X (CONS (CONS 'ISTEP (CDAR X)) (CDR X))) ))
+                        ; A hack to increase the likelihood of small integers
+
+So, one `rule' is, if you iterate with a sequence with lower bound
+0,1, or 2, with an increment of 1, you get fixnum arith. Otherwise you
+get generic arithmetic.
+
+However, this is not a hard and fast rule, since the compiler can say
+'(ISTEP |i| 5 23) [say] during code generation and force fixnum arith. 
+
+
+This leads to a question. Tim, in interp/wi2.boot we have a
+redefinition of compIterator (default implementation is in
+iterator.boot). This new definition makes an attempt at deciding when
+fixnum stepping code should be generated. Do you have an explanation
+as to why is this not the default definition? The original version of
+the code in iterator.boot is what gets called.
+
+I'm wondering if it is possible that during the fixedPoint build if
+some of the new definitions (particularly those in wi2.boot,
+xruncomp.boot) are being autoloaded during compilation. The changes
+which I have already noted in the generated lisp seem to support this
+(fixnum arith vs. generic arith, inlining of trivial coercions,
+etc). All the changes make sense if they are the result of calling one
+of the `improved' functions which these files redefine.

+            ++ char(s) provides a character from a string s of length one.
+        space:  () -> %
+            ++ space() provides the blank character.
+        quote:  () -> %
+            ++ quote() provides the string quote character, \spad{"}.
+        escape: () -> %
+            ++ escape() provides the escape character, \spad{_}, which

+            ++ strings.

+The BOOTSTRAP code, annotated, looks like:
+
+
+=====================================================================
+The VERSIONCHECK variable came about when we were writing the Aldor
+compiler. We had completely reimplemented the algebra so that it was
+incompatible with previous versions. This is checked on loading.
+
+(|/VERSIONCHECK| 2) 
+
+=====================================================================
+This implements the 
+        a = b                  == a =$Rep b
+function. Note that the function name |CHAR;=;2$B;1| is constructed
+from the domain abbreviation; the function name; the number of arguments
+and their types; and a unique number
+
+Also note that the compiler claims that it knows that the '='
+function can be replaced with lisp 'EQL' in compiled code so
+this function is never run. It uses a property list marker
+'|SPADreplace|' on the function symbol to implement the replacement
+during compiles.
+
+(PUT (QUOTE |CHAR;=;2$B;1|) (QUOTE |SPADreplace|) (QUOTE EQL)) 
+
+(DEFUN |CHAR;=;2$B;1| (|a| |b| |$|) (EQL |a| |b|)) 
+
+=====================================================================
+This implements the 
+        a < b                  == a <$Rep b
+function. Again note that the compiler knows that calls to this 
+function can be replaced by the lisp QSLESSP function. The 'QS' 
+prefix is a VMLisp idiom. 'Q' == quick (no type check) 'S'=singleinteger
+which, at least in VMLisp turns into a single instruction. QSLESSP
+(uppercased here because spad is case-sensitive and lisp is not)
+is defined in src/interp/vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet as a macro with
+embedded type information.
+
+(PUT (QUOTE |CHAR;<;2$B;2|) (QUOTE |SPADreplace|) (QUOTE QSLESSP)) 
+
+(DEFUN |CHAR;<;2$B;2| (|a| |b| |$|) (QSLESSP |a| |b|)) 
+
+=====================================================================
+This implements 
+        size()                 == 256
+and just returns a "boxed integer" (XLAM is a marker for boxing).
+
+(PUT (QUOTE |CHAR;size;Nni;3|) (QUOTE |SPADreplace|) (QUOTE (XLAM NIL 256))) 
+
+(DEFUN |CHAR;size;Nni;3| (|$|) 256) 
+
+=====================================================================
+This implements the
+        index n                == char((n - 1)::Integer)
+function. Notice that this does a 'QREFELT'. This is another VMLisp
+idiom 'Q' is quick, 'REFELT' is a vector lookup function. This is
+also implmented as a macro in src/interp/vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet where
+it does a 'svref', simple vector reference into the current domain
+(that's what '|$|' means) and calls the 18th element from this domain.
+
+The domain is represented by a vector (the domain vector) which you'll
+find at the bottom of this file. The domain vector for a domain is
+kept on the property list of the domain name symbol, in this case it
+is "Character". So we see the code:
+
+(MAKEPROP (QUOTE |Character|) (QUOTE |infovec|) (LIST (QUOTE #(NIL NIL ...
+
+The |infovec|, the information vector, contains a lot of domain specific
+information which is looked up at runtime. In this case we are doing a
+(QVREFELT |$| 18). If you count 18 elements into the |infovec| you'll
+find |CHAR;char;I$;6|. If you examine the symbol name carefully you
+can decode that it is a function from the domain "CHAR" (this domain)
+called "char" that takes one argument of type "I" (integer), and is
+the 6th function in this domain, which happens to be 
+        char(n:Integer)        == n::%
+
+So this function does what it says, it subtracts 1 from its argument,
+treats it as an integer and returns the integer. The reason this works
+is that "Characters" have a representation of SingleInteger:
+        Rep := SingleInteger      -- 0..255
+
+(DEFUN |CHAR;index;Pi$;4| (|n| |$|) (SPADCALL (|-| |n| 1) (QREFELT |$| 18))) 
+
+.....[snip]....
+
+=====================================================================
+This is the function that gets executed when "Character" gets instantiated.
+This function has the effect, if memory serves, of putting the function
+"Character;" into the |$ConstructorCache|. The |$ConstructorCache| is a
+hash table used for fast lookup and function dispatch. The call to 
+|Character| will call |Character;| (see below).
+
+(DEFUN |Character| NIL

+
+=====================================================================
+This function initializes the |infovec| data structure. Notice the calls

+The second maphash returns the loaded domains. The messages that get

+to be the same domains you'll see in the constructor cache. Loading
+the domain causes it to be "instantiated" which means that the 
+infovec for the domain gets filled in and stuck in the constructorcache.
+
+If a domain is already in the constructor cache it will not be loaded.
+Thus domain loading occurs on demand and only once.

+Oops, sorry that I have not read the documentation of Any.
+I had a look at Any now. Well, from that I just got the feeling that a programmer should never use Any if there are better types around (and often there are). Any seems to be connected to the interpreter. Since everything must have a type and the interpreter cannot figure out something reasonable, it falls back to Any.
+
+I'd rather be happy if the interpreter is clearly separated from the compiler.
+
+The interpreter is for working with Axiom, so it could help the (lazy) user and find/guesss appropriate types for him/her. However there should be NO guessing when it comes to writing new library code.
+
+Looking at the code of Any reminds me much of the things I have suggested here
+
+address@bogus.example.com">http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/address@bogus.example.com
+The code is in cvs.aldor.org/aldor/aldorug/samples/object*.as.
+
+
+The problem I still have with any is that it says
+
+
+     Rep := Record(dm: SExpression, ob: None)
+     dom x      == x.dm
+
+
+which looks very near to some LISP thing.
+So I can ask for the domain a: Any by calling dom(a). Then I will get an SExpression which makes me feel lost.
+
+Unfortunately, I have no runnig Axiom at the moment :-(
+And I cannot compile axim--main--1 (bfd.h is missing and I have no idea what to install).
+
+So I tested on
+
+
+http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomInterface
+
+
+i: Integer := 1
+  Type: Integer
+
+
+a: Any := i::Any
+  Type: Integer  <----- very interesting!!!
+
+
+dom a
+   Type: SExpression
+obj a
+  Type: None
+
+
+j: Integer := a :: Integer
+  Type: Integer
+
+
+It seems the interpreter is quite smart.
+
+
+
+
+
+s: String := "I am a string"
+  Type: String
+
+
+b: Any := s::Any
+  Type: String
+
+
+dom b
+  Type: SExpression?
+
+
+obj b
+  Type: None
+
+
+k: Integer := b :: Integer
+   Cannot convert from type Any to Integer for value
+   "I am a string"
+
+
+
+This Error is OK. And I think for manually working with Axiom, one just needs to type dom(...) and then coerce to the now known type.
+But how to use Any in a program is totally unclear to me. I have no idea to get the domain back from the SExpression.

+++ Author: Robert S. Sutor

+++   object and its type. This is a way of converting arbitrary
+++   objects into a single type **without losing any** of the
+++   original information. Any object can be converted to one of
+++   \spadtype{Any}.
+
+and in the related file ANY1.spad
+
+)abbrev package ANY1 AnyFunctions1
+++ Basic Functions:  coerce, retractIfCan, retractable?, retract
+++ Description:
+++   \spadtype{AnyFunctions1} implements several utility functions
+++   for working with \spadtype{Any}. These functions are used to
+++   go back and forth between objects of \spadtype{Any} and objects
+++   of other types.
+
+So the situation is not quiet so simple. Apparently Any does not
+mean Any in the sense of throwing away essential information.

+be even better? The above code will not compile in Aldor, since it does not have PositiveInteger. And maybe it will even not compile with appropriate substitutions since the compiler cannot handle such a construction. I am, however, very much against the Any type. It is like building a strongly typed language and than trying to forget about types. For the interpreter it maybe OK, but not for the compiler.
+
+Programming in Axiom should mean writing programs for the compiler. I would say that programming in the interpreter is just writing short scripts but not real programs.

+
+That does not look like a *signature* to me. What is the

+`PrimeField n'? A signature should specify the domains of
+the function, but `PrimeField n' is not a domain until `n'

+
+  Union(PrimeField n for n=1.. | prime? n)
+
+But of course we can't write it quite this nicely right now

+
+This is similar to Axiom's insistence that
+
+  A:Integer
+
+can not be used in the expression
+
+  A+1
+
+until A is assigned a value. I this case I think it should

+
+The above is an example. Perhaps, more convincing:
+
+Foo: with { g: (n: PositiveInteger, k: PositiveInteger) -> PrimeField(n) } 
+   == add { g(n: PositiveInteger, k: PositiveInteger ): PrimeField(n) ==

+ 
+Another example is Marcus Better's problem, more examples are in

-The domain is represented by a vector (the domain vector) which you'll
-find at the bottom of this file. The domain vector for a domain is
-kept on the property list of the domain name symbol, in this case it
-is "Character". So we see the code:
+Fixed by the patch I send earlier (I hope)...
 
-(MAKEPROP (QUOTE |Character|) (QUOTE |infovec|) (LIST (QUOTE #(NIL NIL ...
 
-The |infovec|, the information vector, contains a lot of domain specific
-information which is looked up at runtime. In this case we are doing a
-(QVREFELT |$| 18). If you count 18 elements into the |infovec| you'll
-find |CHAR;char;I$;6|. If you examine the symbol name carefully you
-can decode that it is a function from the domain "CHAR" (this domain)
-called "char" that takes one argument of type "I" (integer), and is
-the 6th function in this domain, which happens to be 
-        char(n:Integer)        == n::%
+> By the way, could you explain what your patches are doing? It's just a mystery
+> to me! I suspect that one needs some knowledge of Aldor internals?
 
-So this function does what it says, it subtracts 1 from its argument,
-treats it as an integer and returns the integer. The reason this works
-is that "Characters" have a representation of SingleInteger:
-        Rep := SingleInteger      -- 0..255
+The significant bit is removing an unbound variable from as.boot, the
+rest is to fix the )co command (obviously not bullet proof), and the .ap
+file generation.  
 
-(DEFUN |CHAR;index;Pi$;4| (|n| |$|) (SPADCALL (|-| |n| 1) (QREFELT |$| 18))) 
+In terms of aldor internal knowledge, you don't need that much, the hard
+work is on the axiom side. The trick is to load all the aldor runtime
+env interpreted and see what breaks (this includes daase.lisp, as.clisp
+& interop.clisp, plus the aldor .lsp files).  This stuff used to vaguely
+work, so putting it back in shape can't be too bad.  \end{verbatim}

+I just tried another example, which is in fact the reason why I would love to

-is slightly wrong. It does NOT put the function |Character;| in the

+Never mind.
 
+Unfortunately, there is a more severe issue. I put the following simple domain
+in a file "test.as" and compiled it using 
 
-You'll also find the function call
+aldor -O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom test.as

-reverse-engineer the contents of the initial slots (which are just
-  #(NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL ....
-at compile time.
+#1 (Warning) Deprecated message prefix: use `ALDOR_' instead of `_AXL'
 
-Clearly documenting stuffDomainSlots would help as would documenting
-all of the rest of it.
+but I suspect that this is of no importance.
 
-Also, for your amusement, try the following:
 
-axiom
-(1)-> )lisp (setq $DALYMODE t)
-(1)-> )set message autoload on
-(1)-> (maphash #'(lambda (key val) (format t "key=~a val=~a~%~%" key val))

+                  n := n-1; }
+                res } }
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
-The second maphash returns the loaded domains. The messages that get
-printed (from loadlib in src/interp/lisplib.boot.pamphlet) turn out 
-to be the same domains you'll see in the constructor cache. Loading
-the domain causes it to be "instantiated" which means that the 
-infovec for the domain gets filled in and stuck in the constructorcache.
+After this I start axiom and load runtime and axextend. By the way axextend
+*is* in the distribution, it's only a little hidden... There is even more
+obscure stuff in theis directory, maybe it's of use to you!
 
-If a domain is already in the constructor cache it will not be loaded.
-Thus domain loading occurs on demand and only once.

Subject: I can't compile the last axiom on a debian.

Hello,

Last month I try the axiom compiler.
Then my laptop was repaired under warranty, and now I get it back.

I use the debian testing etch distribution, but I prefer to recompile
axiom from cvs because i make big mistakes with the unstable debian
version and then I must reinstall all the system.

So I get axiom from cvs and I type

./confugure
export AXIOM=/home/fmy/Fabrique/axiom/mnt/linux
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
make

The first error seems to be :
    ./configure: line 2412: syntax error near unexpected token `('
and the last ones are at the end of the make log.

Thanks a lot if you can help me.

yeah, i'm hoping to have the doyen CD be the basis for the next issac
conference cd which should be built in may. i usually only get a week
to do the build so we have to make sure that all the axiom-related and
wiki-related stuff "just works" by that time.

let me know when the iso is available (and where). be sure to copy the

I think it is a bug in Axiom not reporting what the temporary symbol %%A0 is. I

Axiom is correct. When the root is substituted into Axiom's solution, I got:

This has the form: 

   c1 * %e**((a+b*%i)*t) + c2 * %e**((a - b*%i)*t) + c3 * %e**(c*t)

where c is the real root of the denominator. If you apply the Euler identity

   %e**((a+b*%i)*t) = %e**(a*t)(cos(b*t) + %i*sin(b*t))

   %e**((a-b*%i)*t) = %e**(a*t)(cos(b*t) - %i*sin(b*t))

you can rewrite the inverse Laplace transform into the form you have.  Here is
the answer from Mathematica (simplified after removing near-zero imaginary
components in the coefficients):

e^(0.8237133286601279 t)(1.5884560524891629 cos(0.73178613230714 t) 
- (10.387712479126234 sin(0.73178613230714t))
- (1.0884560524891655) e^(-1.6474266573202556 t) 

So I believe the coefficient of the sine term in your solution is not correct
and should be half its value or -10.387712479126234. The value of f(0) = 0.5.

Of course the most reliable method to install Axiom on Debian
is just:

  apt-get install axiom

But if you really do want to build Axiom from the cvs sources,
there are a couple of other things you will need to do.

Francois, you have found a bug in the configure script of the
version of gcl (2.6.7) that is built by Axiom. The bug and a patch
from Vadim V. Zhytnikov to correct the problem is described here:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gcl-devel/2006-01/msg00014.html

I have just committed this patch to the cvs as savannah, so to
get the updated Axiom source you should do this:

  cd /home/fmy/Fabrique/axiom
  cvs update

This corrects the problem above, but on Debian you will also
run into another problem concerning the GCLOPTS that Axiom
uses by default. On Debian you must use the 'locbfd' option.
To do this edit 'Makefile.pamphlet'

  vi Makefile.pamphlet

and look for 'makefile.linux' then change '<<GCLOPTS>>' to
'<<GCLOPTS-LOCBFD>>'.

Now you can try the build again:

  ./configure
  (set variables)
  make clean
  make

---------

I have just tried this procedure on my Debian sarge/testing
system and it appears to work. Pleae let me know if you have
any problems.

Yes, although of course some HTML <form action="..."> has

The processing on the server-side will have to be at
least initiated by some Python code that is associated
with the type of Zope objects you will be creating. See
for example how I handle the "tangle" operation now in
the pamphlet files on MathAction. In that case the Python
code calls 'notangle' internally.

But the triggering of the "submit" action would normally
be handled by something like JavaScript in the browser or
by some other HTTP-aware "helper" application.

This sounds quite possible but it perhaps might involve
more coding then alternatives. If you do it this way,
the local "helper" application could be written in any
programming language, but presumably you would want to
choose carefully in order to minimize the effort of
porting to/from at least Windows and Linux.

I think your idea is clear enough. But it will not be
possible to write everything that you need inside ZWiki -
only part of it. The major alternative as I see it is to
write JavaScript for a browser like FireFox. This has
the great benefit of being highly portable and provides
an otherwise very familiar interface for the user.

JavaScript locally in a browser does have some limitations
but I think for what you want to do, it might be the most
simple solution.

How does you current test drag-and-drop application work?
Can it be easily used as the front-end to what you want
to do on LatexWiki?

I am worried that you are trying to use the

/var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var/Data.fs

file.

This database will *first* require that you have a
working set of software, Zope+ZWiki+LatexWiki+MathAction
changes to LatexWiki. It should be possible for you to
*first* enter Axiom commands and see the output at graphics
in your browser. Only *then*, after it is working, should
you try to link the new

 /var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var/Data.fs

file. If the software is not correctly configured, then
this file will certainly fail to display pages. You
should however be able to use ZMI

http://localhost:9673/manage

provided you have a valid user id.

Even after you link the new Data.fs, you will not be
able to see any of the graphic output until you have
run the command

http://localhost:9673/mathaction/FrontPage/clearCache

(do this for each page, or do

http://localhost:9673/mathaction/FrontPage/upgradeAll

for all pages. /upgradeAll is likely to take a long time! )

This will cause Axiom and latex and ghostscript etc. to be
run again to create the .png files in the ../var/LatexWiki
directory.

Yes, I think that is correct. The administrator user id and
password is stored in the Data.fs.

I can add your user id and password to the Zope database on
axiom-developer.org, so then when you copy it, you will be
able to use that user id. Please let me know what you would
like it to be.

This directory (and all the sub-directories and files) only
needs to be readable by the 'zope' user.

chown -R zope:zope /var/lib/zope2.7/instance
chown -R a+r /var/lib/zope2.7/instance

This should be the case by default. These files are not
accessed directly by the browser, but only through Zope as
"Zope objects", so user 'zope' needs to be able to read
from the sub-directory. I will try to explain this in more
detail below.

Yes, that is a good sign. Also it is a very good sign that
you can find the .png files. That means almost everything
is working. Just for some reason your browser cannot access
the image files.

This is not a directory, it is a **folder object** inside the
Zope database. You should be able to see it if you go to ZMI

  http://localhost:9673/manage

If you click on 'mathaction' (the name of your local
latexwiki) and then on 'images' you should see the contents
of the .../var/LatexWiki directory.

If you click on the tab 'properties' you should be able to
see that the basepath which points to

/var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/LatexWiki

> It is not under

In fact both 'images' (the Zope folder) and '.../var/LatexWiki'
(the directory) are the same thing. The purpose of 'LocalFS'
product that you asked about earlier is to make something that
is really stored in the file system look like a virtual Zope
object. It is like an "alias" that allows the Zope webserver
to access the contents of a directory

'images' ==> /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/LatexWiki

So a url like:

 http://localhost:9673/mathaction/images/1936239154-18px.png

(replace 'mathaction' with the name of your local text latexwiki)

should display the contents of the file

ls /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/LatexWiki/1936239154-18px.png

in your browser.

You should actually see the graphic for the equation in your
browser. Does this work? Or do you get an error message?

This is exactly the same as what the HTML img attribute

 ... src="images/1936239154-18px.png"

is trying to do.

No, that is not the correct thing to do. 'images' is
already (or at least should be) directly associated with
/var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/LatexWiki

Yes, this all must be working because you actually have .png
files in the .../var/LatexWiki directory. That is good.

It sounds to me like there must be a problem with the LocalFS
folder object 'images'. Perhaps it was not created when you
created the Type: latexwiki ZWiki object (it should have been).
Or perhaps

/var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/LatexWiki

is not accessible to user 'zope'? (It should have at least
read access.).

Please let me know the results of the commands above.

Great.

The Zope database on axiom-developer.org is:

  /var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var/Data.fs

This file is updated dynamically so an rsync of this one
may not be in an entirely consistent state.

A backup copy this database is re-created every Sunday
night in:

  /var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var/Data.fs.old

This one is guaranteed to be consistent but it is only
updated once per week.

I would recommend using rsync to keep your local copy of

  /var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var/Data.fs.old

up to date.

This database file contains "hard links", i.e. file names
with full paths, so it is necessary for you to recreate
exactly this directory structure

  /var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var

on you system.

Of course, I suggest that you do not try this until after
you are sure that your local copy of the MathAction software
is working properly.

The first time you try this, make sure you keep a copy of
your local Zope database (Data.fs file):

cp /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/Data.fs \
   /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/Data.fs.backup

This things fail, then you may have to restore the Data.fs
file from the backup copy.

Then you can provide a symbolic link from your version of
Zope to the copy of the MathAction database file, something
like this:

/var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl stop

mv /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/Data.fs \
  /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/Data.fs.old

ln -s /var/lib/plone2/main/zeo/var/Data.fs.old  \
      /var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/var/Data.fs

/var/lib/zope2.7/instance/zope1/bin/zopectl start

After restarting Zope, I think you should use your browser
to immediately issue the command in ZMI

http://localhost:9673/manage

Control_Panel/Database Management/Main/30 days/Pack.

This will have the effect of creating a new Data.fs file
with updated hard links.

--------

There may be one complication which I have not yet fully
tested. The Data.fs file on axiom-developer.org contains
data for both the Axiom Wiki and the Axiom Portal (plone).
You may not want to bother with installing plone locally
on your system. I think this should be ok, provided of
course that you do not try to access the 'plone' object
in the copy of the database.

--------

Another small complication is that some of the links on
the web pages on Axiom Wiki point to url like this:

  /public/book2.pdf

Because Zope does not handle very large objects efficiency,
these files are not actually stored in the Zope database
but rather are located in the file system. The Apache
webserver is used as a "front-end" on axiom-developer, these
references are served directly by Apache. Zope is accessed
as a "back-end" server via proxy. But in your case you do
not have Apache so you would have to use ZMI to create a
Zope folder called 'public' and store the files in that
folder. Perhaps it would be better if I create this folder
first in the remote Zope database and duplicate the public
files there.

------

Probably all this sounds quite obscure to you right now,
but if you have patience, I am quite sure that we can set
things up so that a weekly rsync script could operate
transparently to keep you local mirror of axiom-developer
up to date.

Hi Bill,

I will look into the way you call the notangle inside your scripts. Right
now
we have this application: http://toolbox1.sytes.net/doyen/dragdrop/

If you drag and drop a pamphlet file here, (you must drag the link of
course)
the application will read the pamphlet extract the make file and process th=
e
information in the pamphlet (extract the tex, source, etc).

This application for the front end has a java script that makes sure the
file is
a pamphlet file, and everything else is discarted. Then, the JS calls a PHP
script and passes the location and the name of the file. The PHP script
takes
care of downloading the file and process it locally, then it displays a pdf
file.

So I assume at this point, what I would like to do is to integrate this app=
,
and ZWiki. I would look into the scripts and see the way this works.

Worse than that: **both** :(

You have found bugs in both the documentation and in the
implementation!

There seems to be a bug in the Axiom interpreter that does not
treat the pile syntax correctly when the if statement is the
outer most block. So for example, if you try the third and
fourth cases shown in the Axiom book, but nest them inside
another block like this:

  for i in 2..2 repeat
    if i > 0 then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

  for i in 2..2 repeat
    if i > 0
    then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

the nested if statements are both parsed and executed properly.

But as you reported both of these

  if i > 0 then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

  if i > 0
  then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

given syntax errors when they are the outer most block. There
should be no difference.

On the other hand the last example given in the book:

  if i > 0
    then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

**is wrong** and it is also (correctly) reported as a syntax
error even if we write it nested inside another block:

  for i in 2..2 repeat
    if i > 0
      then output("positive")
      else output("nonpositive")

Further the statement that the "pile syntax is suspended" in the
book is both wrong and misleading. There are no cases in Axiom
when the pile syntax in suspended. I think the author of that part
of the book was confused.

The problem is that you are mixing the two methods of writing blocks.
The use of the ';' separator in pile syntax might be confusing since
it is expected to be used with ( ) to form a block. Your statement:

   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
     x := 1 ; y := 1

is interpreted by Axiom as if you had written either:

   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
      x := 1
   y := 1

or

   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then (x := 1;) y := 1

So you should write:

 test: (INT,INT) -> List(INT)
 test(a,b) ==
   x := 0; y := 0
   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
     x := 1
     y := 1
   [x,y]

-------

Note: List only takes one argument. In Axiom lists are homogeneous
(all elements of the list must be of the same type).

The correct alternative way to write this would be:

  if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then (x := 1 ; y := 1)

If you are not using the pile syntax, then you must group
statements using parenthesis. In the Axiom interpreter these
parentheses are treated the same way as brackets the { } in
some other languages.

I think you should try Axiom's hyperdoc browser. (Unfortunately it

provides a lot of useful information of this kind for the new Axiom

Seriously, I think you have made a good contribution. Axiom

That syntax in "pile" format would be equivalent to

  if i > 0 ( then output("positive"); else output("nonpositive") )

which would correspond to misplaced brackets { } in some other
languages.

I agree but I would not say that they are "incompatible" -
only that the combination produces some unexpected results.
I think the Axiom implementation should probably be changed
to correspond to modern usages such as in Python and other
languages that use indentation.

Again, I agree. I also do not use Hyperdoc very much. My experience
is also that it often crashes, although I am not yet able to
document a specific sequence which causes a crash. If we could
report and reproduce such bugs, then it should not be difficult
to correct the problems. But even then, I do not much care for the
"look" of the user interface. There have been much discussion and
some programming work to replace Hyperdoc with a modern web
browser interface, but so far we do not have a good replacement
for Hyperdoc.

Excellent! This is exactly the kind of use of Axiom that I think

help from the Axiom user group with any problems that you report

  Aldor is a language for writing Axiom libraries which was written

education for quite some time.

  The language used for writing Axiom libraries is called SPAD (short
for Scratchpad, the original name of Axiom).  While Axiom was still
being developed by IBM, an improved language, Aldor, was created for
writing Axiom libraries.  While the Aldor compiler was originally part
of the Axiom system, it became a separate project when NAG
discontinued the sale of Axiom as a commercial product.  The Aldor
compiler was not part of Axiom when the Axiom sources were relicensed,
and so is not currently included with Axiom.

  Binaries for Aldor have been made freely available and the sources are
available under a generous license.  However, the license does not
qualify as a free or open source license.  While Axiom can still make
use of Aldor as a library compiler (on those platforms where a
suitable binary version is available), the lack of a free license for
Aldor prohibits it from being a standard part of the Axiom open source
distribution, and so nothing in the base Axiom system can depend on
Aldor.

  A free license for Aldor would allow it to become a standard part of
Axiom, which would improve Axiom and make Aldor a more widespread
language.  A free license available as soon as possible would allow
current development on Axiom to use Aldor.
 
  We, the undersigned, respectfully request that the Aldor compiler be
released under a free license at the earliest opportunity.

Okay; that's done, and there's a FreeAldor page.

I'm not sure how to freeze text; perhaps it needs to be done by an
administrator.

It wasn't a server error and there wasn't an error message.
My browser simply kept trying without success.  (I use Firefox; the
wheel thing in the tab kept spinning, indicating it was trying.)
It's working fine now; it was probably a problem with the local
network here.

Oh yes, I didn't realize that message was old.

I had some trouble with my server over the holidays when I was across

I had the same issue earlier today, Internet Explorer. (Yeah, yeah -
work computer.  They don't let us use Firefox here.)

Yes. To do this you have to have Zope administrator access. By
default anyone can edit a wiki page, but it is possible to set
security options so that only someone logged in as administrator
can do this. I have changed the page you created so that it is now
protected.

I think it may be subtle problem with the Zope software. Ever since
we moved to the new hardware and also changed to using zeo for
database access, occassionally the Zope server seems to go into a
mode where it is using 99.9% of the processor and doing very little
real work. I am not sure of the exact cause, however I know that
if I stop and re-start both the zeo and zope server processes the
problem goes away. Right now I have set both of these servers to
automatically restart at about midnight CST every night so that if
the server is hung for some reason, then at least it should be ok
the next day without my intervention.

There have been some reports of problems like this related to the
older version of Python 2.3 that we are still using for MathAction.
In fact we are now more than a year behind the current versions of
both Python, Zope and ZWiki. I think I must plan seriously to upgrade
the software to the newer versions real soon.

Please let me know if this happens again.

Subject: GUI paper worth reading

Anybody know Neil Soiffer?  It looks like he did a degree at UC
Berkeley, and then went on to work for Wolfram.  He is currently (I
think) Senior Scientist Design Science, Inc.  His thesis looks like it
might very well be the perfect starting point for a literate
programming GUI pamphlet (needs a fair bit of updating of course, but
he seems to have covered a good many of the basics we would need.) 
There is a PDF (unfortunately images only) located here:

http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/TechRepPages/CSD-91-626

Apparently he has copyright (how does this work at Berkeley?) so if he
is so inclined he might be able to release it to us.  Of course its
still valuable as a reference either way, but it sure would be easier
building off if it than starting from scratch and referring to it. 
Does anybody know him?

I suppose in once sense it might be better to start from square one -
just as with the Units paper, there is a large amount of territory
which should be covered before we have the knowledge of what the "best"
ideas for a GUI are.  His thesis is 259 pages - I suspect in the end
(particularly with source code) we will be over a thousand in order to
define a really good GUI both as a research project and a functional
interface.  The advantage (particularly if we do it in lisp and design
with an eye for flexibility) is that the same core code could serve a
wide variety of interfaces - for example, running as a server effective
line breaking code could generate (in theory anyway) MathML which was
line broken for display in a browser, given the browser is kind enough
to report its dimensions and resizing events.

The old symbolicnet site has stashed away on it a bibtex file
containing a fairly large collection of computer algebra GUI
references.  It needs some retooling I expect (I assume the various
"portal" sites can provide more fleashed out entries for the individual
references, for example) and unfortunately neither of the original
authors has responded to my requests for licensing status info, but it
will at least be an excellent guide.

Subject: gui/axiom research question

perhaps this is a good "summer of code" problem

Reading Soiffer's PhD thesis (The Design of a User Interface for
Computer Algebra Systems) raises an interesting research question.

assume you're given a standard page size (8 1/2 x 11, A4, display size)
and you have an equation to format in some understandable way 
how can you format the equation to fit on one page.

the underlying "assumption" is that equations longer than one page are
unreadable and useless.

we allow a variety of techniques:

* line breaks when the equation hits the edge

* common subexpression elimination when it can occur
    
    R = (x+y) * (z+(x*y)) ==>

    let M = (x+y)
        R = M * (z+M)

    so that you can "name" common subexpressions and lift them

* function reification

    "name" a subexpression that requires a parameter, 
    lift it out, and substitute a parameterized term.
    in a tree or DAG representation this is node-naming

* term reification
    
    "name" a term, lift it out, and substitute
    in a tree or DAG representation this is node-naming

* term summarization
    
    replacing a (reordered) subset of the terms by a summation

* eliding leading, trailing, or middle terms 


     term + term + ... + term

* linearizing terms

    terms, such as fractions, can be rewritten in linear form to 
    save lines

* constant naming

    long constants replaced by short names:


     R = 3.77612876767 * foo ==>

     let M = 3.77612876767
         R = M * foo

* pattern naming

    turn 2D template structures (powers/ratios/matricies/polys) into
    "named" template structures and substitute

    +-   -+   +-   -+ 
    | 1 2 |   | 5 6 |
    |     | * |     |
    | 3 4 |   | 7 8 |
    +-   -+   +-   -+

Hi Bill,

I am having a little problem with the pamphlets and the latex wiki. I get
this error:

noweb: cd '/var/zope/var/LatexWiki/Doyen';
/usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/lib/noweave -delay 'LatexWiki.pamphlet' > '

Looking into the noweave file I see this line:

line 5: LIB=/root/axiom--main--1--patch-30/mnt/fedora3/bin/lib

I guess my axiom installation does not have this. Is that a patch that I am
missing? If it is, is that the full path?

Thank you,

That's probably the major remaining question for formatting mathematics

Not necessarily.  I think we can treat the "vertical" direction as a
series of lines of varying heights, and come up with some reasonable
algorithms to handle most cases.  There are obviously some corner cases
where nothing will make it look good, but in most cases I think
multi-page is probably not as hard as the "line breaking" problem.

Right - that's the first trigger that any sort of line breaking is
needed.

I think these are less common in practice but I like them as an option
- it can sometimes help reveal "high level structure" in a busy
expression.

This is of course the ultimate fallback - linearize the equation and

Another case of term naming, although with the twist that * needs to be

matricies.

Do you mean "identify the top level mathematical operators?"  An
expression could be a sum and yet have one of the terms be determinent
of a large matrix (large meaning larger than page width, in this case).
 I think reasonable rulesets can be devised, and I hope as I work my
way through this thesis it will help align my thinking :-).

Hmm.  Not sure how that could be handled.
 
> * *depth*, *width*, *height* maximums as parameters

Those are ultimately constrained by the page, with page width being an
absolute limit and page height being infinite but requiring breaking
over pages.  Not sure what depth would refer to.

I tend to regard it as somewhere inbetween - boxes are the virtually
universal metaphor for algorithm description in this situation, but
things like strict super and subscript rules tend to make it a little
more complex than a normal tree or DAG (unless I'm thinking about those
terms incorrectly).

> compute the weight (area?) of a node in the tree or DAG
> and do some sort of weight-reduction?

I think it depends a lot on the situation and the mathematics involved.
 Take, for example, a large nxn matrix larger than both page width and
height (let's say for the sake of argument it contains only integers
from 0-9, or more correctly that each element is already atomic in
size. It could only be displayed in the confines of a page/book
environment by either hiding some part of the matrix, or something like
the following:

It's arguable whether or not that would be useful, but it would
preserve both information concerning the location of all elements in
the matrix and the complete set of matrix data.  Of course, there are
even more interesting limit cases, such as what happens if one or more
columns or rows is excessively large, there is a situation where a
single column would occupy a page, the column numbers get so large they
widen the column width unreasonably, the row numbers get so large they
require a large fraction of the page area, etc.  I think, in those
situations, the response must be to collapse back to the 1-D ASCII
display, perhaps with some helpful formatting for each element (would
need to think about that one.)

That suggests a general mechanism that had already occurred to me - try
every graphical trick defined to fit a formatted expression onto the
page(s), and if all else fails use the 1-D expression which will always
work.  As more techniques and styles are included the need to fall back
to 1-D will hopefully become rare, but that way the system never hits a
case where it can't produce at least some kind of document.

I don't know if that fits into the DAG/Tree scheme or not - I suppose
it might and I'm just not seeing it.  Fascinating stuff - it's too bad
there's no longer any way to get funding for this kind of work :-). 
Still, even without it a literate pamphlet which systematically
discusses and implements all of this would be a lot of fun.  AFAICT
research on this sort of dried up in the early to mid 1990s, with the
commercial GUIs making polishing and incremental improvements.  (Which
are nice, don't get me wrong...)  Subsequent efforts seem to be focused
on web based technologies and techniques.  I'm afraid I don't quite see
the point of that, since to my mind a web interface is just another
instance of a mathematical interface that happens to be rather
constrained, and its merely a question of what techniques are available
(or maybe technologies in web browsers) to implement general GUI ideas.
 I think that's probably an injustice, since I've never really liked
the idea of web applications in the first place.  Those papers deserve
study, but I think a good LOCAL GUI should come first, with the
interface logic defined in such a way that it is easy to plate on any
given toolkit or graphical environment.  Call it "server side
intelligent formatting", I guess.

Anyway, more reading to do.  I won't plunge into this in a big way for
a while (I've still got a units package to do, after all) and I think
we will find that the first step will be to implement the ideas of TeX
and maybe lout in Lisp (cl-typesetting may be a good platform to use if
we can convince the author to release it under a garden variety
Modified BSD license) and build off of that logic to implement
automated display algorithms for confined 2D formatting.  Knuth knew
about this problem but didn't propose to solve it in TeX, preferring to
leave it to the author to decide how to handle a particular situation. 
We don't have that luxury unfortunately, and although an override
mechanism is a good idea to provide as a "last resort" sort of thing
for the most part we will have to implement the best available
solutions, whatever they may be.

My current thought is to take TeX - the Program and the lout design
documentation, make a coherent design from those and turn
cl-typesetting (if the license is cleared up) into a high powered Lisp
Typesetter.  Possibly we would want to also implement the ability to
render TeX documents, in order to have a UI which uses our Pamphlet
format as it's native file format for notebooks :-).  Then implement
the 2D layout algorithms.  After that, proceed to define other
interface logic and the connections to Axiom.

A lot of work, but as someone said once "nothing worth doing is easy."

This variable in 'noweave' should be pointing to the location
where noweb was installed as part of the Axiom build. My guess
is that

  /root/axiom--main--1--patch-30

is (or at least was at one time) the root of your Axiom source
directory. I don't think that this is a missing patch. It might
just be that Axiom was at patch-30 when the directory was first
created by the 'tla' command. I presume that your source version
of Axiom has been updated since patch-30 since we are now at
about patch-43, I think.

Probably you moved or copied the Axiom binaries to

  /usr/local/axiom

(Maybe this was done as part of the Axiom 'make install'?)

Or is the version of Axiom you are running obtained from one of
the binary distributions? In that case maybe there is an error in
the noweave LIB variable of that distribution.

In any case, in order to use 'noweave' in it's present location
you will also have to change this variable. My guess is that it
should be:

  LIB=/usr/local/axiom/bin/lib

'noweave' must be able to access the files named 'markup' and
'totex' which would normally be located in the same directory.

That's very strange. I use hyperdoc extensively (really), and I did not see it
crash *once* yet -- provided I did not press the forbidden buttons like
"dependends, "users", "uses" and maybe a few others.

Well, I don't *mind* the look of the user interface, but, as you probably know
by now, I've been shouting for a long time: replace HyperDoc, AxiomUI,
MathAction by a single facility.

I must say that I find it a little sad that -- although the above proposal is
certainly doable within a few weeks, maybe months time -- nobody has found time
to help Ralf (whose ALPROSE is certainly the way to go).

But hyperdoc can do A LOT more than that. Did you ever press the button

But you are comparing different things. ")di op" is not comparable to
"?". Although I do agree that something like this, returning the description
text also provided in HyperDoc should exist.

I sincerely hope that some day my dream of a unified documentation and user
interface format for axiom comes true. If you do have spare time, this would be
just great.

By the way, you mentioned you intend to use Axiom as a teaching tool. Would it
be possible for you to set up a webpage -- or, even better, use mathaction, and
share your .input or .spad files?

I don't recall adding that character.

The character has to be there because that's the "escape" character

will assume you are creating a new chunk.

i'm working on a javascript/html version of the browser documentation.
when we get the doyen version of the system which has the axiom wiki
software locally available it should be possible to use a standard
web browser to do hyperdoc functionality. i've converted some of the
pages to html with embedded javascript and am learning more about AJAX
and the XMLHttpRequest function. getting this to work thru the sman
interface will require some recoding there also.

one useful contribution would be a set of html-only web pages that
describe axiom better. perhaps taking the newly-published axiom
tutorial latex file, converting it to html, and cleaning it up so
it can be used from the browser would be useful. that way, when the
hyperdoc rewrite completes and the wiki runs locally we'll have a
lot more documentation available.

That is a pretty good argument however I don't think it
applies in this case. If I leave the @ character there, the
Axiom build fails (at least on my SuSe 9 installation). If I
remove it, then the build works. Strange.

Maybe this is something peculiar to SuSe 9? I have not seen
this problem before on Fedora Core 3 or on Debian although I
have not checked this part of the build code in a the last few
months. I presume that you also did not have any build failures
on your test systems?

If you remove the @ characters, does the build fail on any of
your test systems?

I am using the version that is part of the Axiom source in the
current tla archive. I have not attempted to make any changes
to use standard noweb. This is just straight out of the tla box.

The noweb documentation says:

"Code chunks begin with
<<chunk name>>=
on a line by itself.  The double  left  angle  bracket  (<<)
must  be  in the first column."

So I think that noweb will not treat the embedded '<< ... >>='
sequence in the following 

<<findSpadFiles>>==
egrep '<<(domain|package|category) .*>>=' ...

as a new chunk definition. But I agree that it might have
ignored the trailing = and treated it as a reference to a
chunk with a very peculiar name. I don't know why this is not
happening, but I do know that if I keep the @ in

egrep '@<<(domain|package|category) .*>>=' ...

then for some reason notangle (mark) does not remove the @
that way the noweb documentation says it is supposed to.

----------

BTW, here is a reference about editing noweb (pamphlet)
documents that might be of interest to some Axiom developers:

http://scottcollins.net/articles/Kate.html

"Kate Syntax Highlighting for Noweb"

Kate is a popular programming editor especially on KDE.

i know that noweb is unhappy with << that occurs in non-column 1
locations because the original problem was due to the C 'shift'
operator causing complaints about non-terminated chunk names.

also, the code given by tla seems to compile fine here.
perhaps you have a different notangle/noweave on your path?

Can you document some specific sequences that cause Hyperdoc to
crash? If so, I think it would be very useful.

Usually shouting is not very effective in open source

Your point of view seems quite unreasonable to me. How much
time have you devoted to this concept (not counting the
shouting ;)? I also would like to see more people working on
Axiom development but I think we have to lead by setting an
example, not just by making suggestions. I personally doubt
that it is "doable within a few weeks", but if you think so
then perhaps you could help by creating a prototype to show
how it might work.

How can ALPROSE be used to do this? What about navigation?
What about access to the Axiom database? What about conversion
of the existing Hyperdoc material?

Perhaps that is a criticism more appropriate to the Axiom

Are there mirrors available somewhere of at least the latest tarball

But your patch to noweb should avoid this, shouldn't it? It seems
to me that the patch would treat this case as an undefined chunk and
pass it right through. I am sure this is how it used to work since
when I wrote this awk thing last year I am positive that I did not
include an @ inside the egrep pattern.

No. There is no 'notangle' in my path. The only version of noweb
on this system is the one in the Axiom source distribution. In any
case I think the Axiom makefiles always use a full path pointing
to the version of noweb in the .../mnt/linux/bin/lib.

I agree that it seems to build ok on other systems, for example
I have built axiom on the axiom-developer.org server even though
the @ now appears in the src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet. It seems
to be stripped out as expected.

noweb internally depends heavily on awk. So far the only difference
that I see on my SuSe 9.1 system is that I have GNU awk 3.1.2 while
on axiom-developer.org we have GNU awk 3.1.1. I don't know if that
is significant.

Just one hour later after being reset there was another apparently
related problem on the axiom-developer.org server where the Zope
process goes into a state that requires 99.9% of the processor time
and does very little work. As I discussed in a previous email, I
suspect that this is due to a bug in the way this version of Zope
interacts with zeo - the database file server. As a result I decided
to remove the zeo database server process and return to the original
configuration where Zope accesses the database file directly.

I have just restarted Zope in this configuration. This *might* have
some negative performance impact, on the other hand I hope that it
will cure the problem temporarily - at least until I get time to
complete the upgrade to Python 2.4 and a newer version of Zope
and zeo.

Please let me know ASAP if you see any more problems.

I'll give those a shot in a couple weeks.  I don't know which one I
installed (IIRC I found it on the arch wiki) and I was using it from
cygwin, so perhaps that didn't work so well.

If the sourceforge cvs is up to date with patch-47 though that's fine -
I didn't realize we were maintaining the cvs there as well (though I
should have.)

I would recommend though that we release a new tarball - IIRC the last
one was Sept. 2005?

Website is now working.  Thanks much!  It will be a couple weeks before
I can try to download patch47 again (need to use girlfriend's computer
as my work one won't let me and my home one is off the net :-(. 
However, I think I'll be able to keep busy until then ;-).

Anyway, the @ makes complete sense to me as an escape character.

ALLPROSE has hyperlinks, but it is intended to be used for development, 
ie, for writing pamphlet files. It is not an API-browsing tool.

A tool like "AldorDoc" should do it:
That program would take a set of aldor-libraries (collection of .ao 
files) and extract the ++ comments from them in order to produce tex or 
html code from them). Unfortunately, AldorDoc is not yet written, but 
what I am suggesting with ALLPROSE is a convention of how to write ++ 
comments. I impose a bit of structure. If at least that convention could 
find its way into future Axiom code documentation that would be great.
Well, of course, there should first be some comments on this convention 
before I can add this code.
Anyway, ALLPROSE supports the literate programming style, so it is not 
enough to just document the API (as is usual with .pamphlet files).

Very true. Still I think I should concentrate on the maths, while I can't
resist telling everybody how I'd like the IDE (integrated documentation

I am not saying anything but that the *format* of the documentation should be
the format proposed by Ralf (albeit for a slightly different purpose).

I mentioned the design problem remaining already: Currently the databases
contain the documentation (extracted from the spad files at compile time) in
HyperDoc format. However, we need a way to have it ready in various different
formats. I guess that LaTeX -> HTML or MATHML or the like is too slow to be
convincing. Maybe for a prototype it would suffice. We would need 

* a script that converts something like the following 

\begin{+++}
  \begin{adusage}
    if \adthisname{} x then ...
  \end{adusage}
  \begin{adparameters}
    \adparameter{x: %} Element to be tested.
  \end{adparameters}
  \begin{addescription}{Tests whether its argument is \adname{0}.}
    The boolean value of \adcode$\adthisname{} x$ is identical to the
    test \adcode$x \adname[MyPrimitiveType]{=} \adname{0}$ in the type, but
    might be implemented more efficiently.

Well, partly. The Axiom Book contains a carefully chosen subset of the domains
shipped with Axiom. I don't think that the printed documentation should strive
to contain everything, it would be too much. The online documentation should,
and it should be printable, but probably not be sold in a bookstore.

Still, how would you get the result from pressing "Domains" when viewing the

will not suffice, I guess.

This document shows the explicit steps necessary to create a Doyen
LiveCD from Red Hat's Fedora Core 3 distribution. The Doyen CD is a
scientific platform which can be distributed at various science
conferences. It enables scientific software to be distributed as
literate programs. The Doyen CD has a local wiki and a set of
scientific packages which can be scripted from the wiki pages. The
scientific packages can be tailor to the specific conference.

In the first screen, you will be presesented with some boot
options. Press Enter to continue.

In the language selection, select your prefered language and click next.

At this point depending if your system is not clean, an upgrade
examine window will appear. Please select {\em "Install Fedora Core"}.

\subsection{Disk Partioning Setup}

In the Disk Partioning Setup, select Manually partition with Disk Druid.

For our base distribution, only three partitions should be created. A
boot partition of 100 MB, a swap space generally the double of your
amount of RAM, and a root partition which size depends on the programs
to be installed in the system.

Preserve the default boot loader configuration.

Preserve the DHCP option for the eth0 by default. For the hostname,
select manually and in the text box type doyen.

Select enable firewall and select Remote Login (SSH) and Web
Server(HTTP, HTTPS). Also, select disable for SELinux.

Select the desire password for the root account. In Doyen Live CD the
default password is doyen@org.

\item httpd

rpm -ivh noweb-2.10a-4.i386.rpm

In this section, you will install and configure the ZWiki server. First,  download the Zope 2.8 rpm package from the rpmfind.net server and the zwiki package.

------=_Part_10012_7484821.1138054533212

Hi Bill,

I have a concern regarding the instructions in
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/InstallingMathAction on how to install
AxiomWiki.

The first thing is that if I follow the instructions, ZWiki does not appear
in Zope products (meaning, I cannot add the ZWiki pages).
However, if I change the steps to download ZWiki and latexwiki from your
repository at:  http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/,
then it works fine (Axiom - Latex inline rendering works). However, the
problem with the pamphlet files is present.

To be more precise these are my steps in the Doyen CD:

wget http://alfredo.axiom-developer.org/redhatbuild/pkgs/LocalFS-1.3-andrea=
s.tar.gz

wget http://alfredo.axiom-developer.org/redhatbuild/pkgs/doyenLatexWiki.tar=
.gz

tar -xzf LocalFS-1.3-andreas.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/zope/lib/python/Products/

tar -xzf latexwiki.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/zope/lib/python/Products/

yum -y install swig

yum -y install gcc

yum -y upgrade python

yum -y install python-devel

cd /usr/lib/zope/lib/python/Products/LatexWiki

swig -python texbreaker.i

gcc -fpic -c texbreaker.c texbreaker_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python2.3

ld -shared texbreaker.o texbreaker_wrap.o -o _texbreaker.so

/etc/init.d/zope start

Have in mind that the doyenLatexWiki.tar.gz is just a tar file containing
ZWiki and LatexWiki from the repository.

I do not know if somebody can confirm that the instructions are not working=
,
and if somebody tried them, can somebody
confirm that the support for pamphlet files works.

Jose Alfredo Perez

What version of Zope and ZWiki are you using? The instructions
above assume 0.35 of both.

Bob McElrath's repository:

    darcs get http://bob.mcelrath.org/darcs/latexwiki

is no longer at version 0.35 and may not be compatible with more
recent versions of ZWiki. For the instructions to work I think
you would need to download these specific versions.

  http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki/releases/ZWiki-0.35.0.tgz

and

  http://mcelrath.org/LatexWiki-0.35.tar.gz

I think the repository is based on the compatible 0.35 versions
of ZWiki and LatexWiki together with the changes that I made for
MathAction, so your procedure is reasonable but you will not be
able to take advantage of improvements to ZWiki and LatexWiki
that were made in later versions by the developers of these
products. (At the moment, neither can MathAction :(

On the other hand, if you start with later compatible version
of both of these packages at least the LatexWiki functionality
should work, but merging in the changes for MathAction will
be more complicated then just overwriting the files specified
in the instructions. It would be better to diff the files and
make changes more carefully.

I don't like the location where you install these products.
Newer versions of Zope usually recommend that you install
products in the "instance" directory rather than the global
Products directory. The instance directory is created when
you run 'mkzopeinstance.py' as part of the Zope installation.

For the version of Zope I am using: zope-2.8.0-2.fc3.i386.rpm.

In my steps, I really never install ZWiki 0.35, I actually just
download ZWiki and LatexWiki from your repository. I guess
this is okay, because Latex and Axiom work fine for me.

Now the pamphlet problem, to be specific, let's say I make
a new page [Test] Pamphlet Test. When I go to the edit form
and put the pamphlet here, if I hit save or preview, I get this
error:

Yes, it is ok. zope-2.8 is a recent version of zope. I am
glad that the older repository source still works. I think
if you try to use the newer version of Python 2.4 there will
be some minor problems.

I cannot access http://141.149.49.72:8080/... because of local

I downloaded the iso and burnt a CD. The CD boots into

You have a good point Bill. Wilken and I have been working on this to
have it auto-login just like Knoppix does. However, the auto-login in
our initial test was only working for the root account and not for the
doyen account. I will try to have it, for the next image.

By the way the root password is the same as for doyen.

Thank you for the feedback. You will see that after a couple of
minutes the CD feels like a normal workstation. I find the performance
better than the previous Knoppix build. Any other feedback,
improvement, hardware support issue, or application you would like to
see in it, are more than welcome.

I would like also to add that I have seem other Distros based on
Fedora that do not have auto-login for regular users. I need to
research more into the subject but it seems like a protection maybe
from GDM.

The worst case scenario, maybe the user and password can be changed to
a more friendly and easy to remember: doyen, doyen respectively.

I need to research more into it. But hopefully I can get it to
auto-login to the doyen user.

You are absolutely right. However, at the beginning of the project we
started with Apache / Perl CGI to test some scripts using programs
like Axiom, Octave, Yacas, Maxima.... I particularly felt more
comfortable with Apache and PHP, that is one of the reasons the
current drag and drop application is written using
Apache/PHP/JavaScript.

I am getting familiar with Zope and DTML pages and also with Python,
so we can have
everything running inside Zope/ZWiki. :-). Hopefully, we can do this
really soon. Wilken
already has modified the edit page in ZWiki where we plan to place the
drag and drop.

Subject: [DoyenCD] Use of Apache or ZWiki

You are absolutely right. However, at the beginning of the project we started with Apache / Perl CGI to test some scripts using programs like Axiom, Octave, Yacas, Maxima.... I particularly felt more comfortable with Apache and PHP, that is one of the reasons the current drag and drop application is written using Apache/PHP/JavaScript.

I am getting familiar with Zope and DTML pages and also with Python, so we can have everything running inside Zope/ZWiki and have only one webserver. Hopefully, we can do this really soon. Wilken already has modified the edit page in ZWiki where we plan to place the drag and drop.

>>For machines with limited memory, this might be an issue.

This really has not been an issue. We have tried the CD in computers with limited resources like 500 Mhz and 256 MB in RAM, and it works really well. The factor of a fast CD-ROM seems to be more important than anything else.

I think the Doyen Wiki on the Doyen CD should have it's own

Also, there are a number of other customization on the Axiom
Wiki site such as the point-and-click menu, Preview for
comments (maybe preview is not so important for local usage),
TouchGraph navigator, and expandable +/- text.

These are all implemented as customizations of the wikipage.pt

Subject: Got copy of new book!

Got my copy of the new tutorial - ordered it through barnes and noble
to use a gift certificate.

Immediate comments:

I like the binding - clean, simple and functional.  We'll see how the
paper quality holds up over time, but at least at the get-go it doesn't
look too bad.

I am somewhat dismayed by the print quality - I don't know if it was
the printer or the fonts, or perhaps they converted the pdf to a bitmap
before printing - but the text print quality is well short of what I
would have expected.  The edges of letters seem "ragged" or uneven,
which sort of gives the impression that you are looking at a
copy-machine copy and not the output from a digital printing with
awareness of fonts.  This could be a function of my copy being an early
print, or maybe the press was having a bad day, but if this is standard
quality lulu will need to upgrade their abilities some.

I was also surprised by the large margins on the outer side and the
bottom - didn't we format to use the full page?  Or, if that makes the
page count too short or if we wanted the smaller content-per-page
format for better reading couldn't we have gone with a smaller printing
size than 8.5x11?  Failing that, couldn't they have centered the
content instead of leaving the big margins?  Or is that a stylistic
decision?  I know it's a nitpick, and I don't mean to sound harsh -
just curious as to the reason for this particular decision.  It's not a
formatting style I've seen in any other printed book I can recall.

Haven't had a chance to read much of it yet (just got it at lunch) so I
can't review the content yet.  

Nitpicks aside, thanks Tim et. al. for making this possible!

Subject: Ability to guarantee a non-hanging Axiom?

Admittedly this is not a problem I have encountered yet, but there are
general problems with solving some types of problems where the user
doesn't know when the computer will not succeed in reasonable time, or
there are multiple methods available (some of which yield a quick
solution in special cases) and the user doesn't know which method to
apply.  Is there a way to have Axiom, in cases where a calculation goes
for n seconds without returing an answer Axiom pauses the calculation
and prompts the user if they want to continue, and if so for how long? 
I don't know if this would require some sort of lisp image level magic,
but I was thinking maybe a macro could wrap every function call with a
"check time" conditional.  Then when a new input was sent from the
user, a global "running time" variable could keep track of how long
since the input was provided.  The "check time" conditional could see
if the total time since input was too great, and if so rather than
proceeding it could offer the user a prompt asking if they wanted to
continue.  If yes with no input for new running time, just reset the
"running time" value to zero and proceed with the actual function call.
 If a new running time limit is provided, subsequent checks can be
against that limit.  If the answer is no, the calculation can be
abandoned, a return of "calculation aborted" returned, and a new input
prompt provided.

This only works if a long calculation is calling more than one lisp
function, but for at least a fair number of cases it would work.  I
don't know how to ensure a "lisp kernel level" checkpoint of the
calculation, but that would be the ideal.

For some things, like solve, it would also be nice to use this feature
to do a "quick check" of a wide variety of solution techniques.  Say
there are four methods of finding some number related to a matrix, and
some are better for sparse and some are better for dense matricies. 
The difference might be so great that the user will notice a difference
if one method is tried vs. another (e.g. milliseconds vs. seconds). 
Since it's impossible to know this in advance, one strategy is to do a
"quick check" - run each technique on the problem with a max allowable
time of a fraction of a second, then perhaps a second each, and then
either pick one technique and run with it or contine to bump the time
each individual routine gets to try it.  Checkpointing each routine
would be nice but is probably very difficult to implement.  But if the
timing mechanism were in place it would make this kind of thing much
easier to do.

Does anybody know anything about such techniques?  i saw it mentioned a
few times on the Maxima list and it made sense to me, but I don't know
what the low level problems would be like.

Magnus (sourceforge.net/projects/magnus) uses such a technique (time slicing)
because there are no algorithms, just procedures which may never terminate,
so it time-slices solutions.

Axiom uses the type information to choose the most specific algorithm.
Types can and do override 'general purpose' algorithms when a specific
one is available.

Currently there are very few lisps that support threads although, as 
you're aware, the lisp gardeners are chatting about it.

I don't think the error has anything directly to do with
GraphViz, but rather hyperref. Unfortunately I do not know
very much about hyperref. The error above does not seem
to me to be a simple matter of a missing package, but
perhaps some incompatible packages.

What version of latex are you using? How were the tex
packages installed? What version of hyperref is installed.
Here is a reference to the standard hyperref distribution.

http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref

This means keyval and url as dependencies - but I think
these are pretty standard.

Unfortunately I forget exactly how and when the tex
packages where installed in axiom-developer.org but the
files for hyperref are dated Oct 2004. It is possible that
they were included in the distribution of pdfetex that
I installed around that time. I get:

[page@axiom-developer page]$ latex --version
pdfeTeX 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)
kpathsea version 3.5.4

The best I can suggest is that you try to re-install a
newer verson of latex with a large compatible set of
packages. The standard distributions for linux are here:

http://www.tug.org/tetex

I suggest to first try getting the Endpaper3.tex file
to compile successfully outside of Doyen Wiki.

Subject: 2.7.0 GUI

Hi Camm.

With HEAD up again on Windows I've returned to the issue of the Tk
binding as the Axiom crew are waiting on a LISP GUI.

I decided that gcl-tk is too tricky in itself as the server relies on a
function not available in the Windows version of Tcl/Tk and I would
rather a system in which a standard download of Tcl/Tk is all that is
needed.

Following that decision I tried directly binding Tk into GCL with
limited success - the event loop seizes even in a separate thread.  I
expect that there is a thread issue in GBC or something similar which we
can return to if/when we give GCL threads.

So I borrowed some code from ECL (their EXT::RUN-PROGRAM, similar to our
SI::RUN-PROCESS and which runs programs via pipes) and got the stable
version of Peter Herth's well regarded Tk binding LTK up on my locally
modified copy of HEAD; sufficiently well to run his demo programs.

It's far from being as nice as a native GUI, but it's a start.

The Unix version of that ECL code needs only minor infrastructural
details seen to.  If I get a chance on a Linux machine I'll work on it.

The GCL HEAD compiler has some trouble with the latest beta release of
LTK (0.88pre2).  Packages also seem to be causing some trouble for the
compiler.

LTK does not compile on the stable branch of GCL.

I don't see the advantage over Ctrl-C, i.e., simply interupting the
computation. 

I would rather suggest:

* a convention like MuPAD's userinfo variable, that makes Axiom spit out
  information (in mathematical terms) about what it's doing currently.

* for selected algorithms, where a bound on the running time is known, to spit
  out this time. However, care has to be taken: "sort" for example has a known
  upper bound on running time, interpolation also. But you wouldn't want Axiom
  to say "sorting 5 elements, which will take approximately 0.000001 seconds" a
  million times. I am also concerned about efficiency a little here -- even if
  we chose to program: don't say anything unless it takes longer than 10
  seconds, we would have the overhead of calculating the bound on the running
  time.

Subject: Aldor and open source
Cc: Stephen Watt

Dear Aldor Developers and Users;

As you know, Aldor was originally developed at IBM as the new
version of the Axiom library compiler. All of the original
IBM Axiom source code is now available as open source with the
sole exception of Aldor. For historical reasons, the licensing
of Aldor is different from Axiom. However in October 2005
Steven Watt told me, in response to my request for information
on the Aldor source license, that open source licensing of
Aldor was then being considered.

It is possible to use Aldor now in the open source version
of Axiom. Many Axiom developers are anxious to carry-out the
original plan of converting all of Axiom's library source code
to Aldor and to continue all new development for Axiom using
Aldor. However the current licensing conditions apparently
prevent the inclusion of the Aldor compiler source code in
the Axiom open source distribution. As a result much of the
energy to update Axiom's mathematical library has been
essentially stalled, awaiting a clarification of this issue.

Many of the Axiom developers and Axiom users have "signed"
an online petition to show there support and encourage the
compatible open source licensing of the Aldor compiler.
See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/FreeAldor

Please consider adding your name to this petition.

For an advanced programming language like Aldor to live and
grow, it is essential that the user and developer communities
be as large as possible. Making the Aldor source available
under an open source license to the entire Axiom community
would greatly help both of these projects to thrive once
again.

I would like to offer to help with the process of making
Aldor open source. If any one has any suggestions about how
to do this, please let me know.

Sincerely,
Bill Page.

Actually, no. It is also necessary to save .../var/LatexWiki

You should **not** assume that the Zope/LatexWiki is installed.
It is possible that the only time the user will be running this

I don't think you want to compile everything from source - that
would be too much. You have to make some assumptions. Already
with the Doyen CD you are assuming at least an x86 processor.
A simple script that would copy all the required binaries and
start the necessary processes might be ok in many cases. But be
careful not to overwrite any of the user's existing stuff without
warning! And also provide an un-install script.

Different Linux distributions and even different libraries in
different versions is likey to cause some problems. Perhaps this
can be minimized by using static linking as much as possible.
But in any case since the Doyen CD is based on Fedora, at least
it should be possible to configure things so installation is
possible on all Red Hat distros. There is a good chance this
might also work with recent versions of SuSE.

Maybe there should also be a Debian/Knoppix variant of the
DoyenCD?

Better would be to include the necessary yum/yast/apt ...
repositories on the CD and instructions on how to use the
native install for each distro. OK... this does sound like
a bit of extra work! :)

Camm,

I have updated the XGCL files.  You should take the files you have
in xgcl-2/ and then get all the files in ftp.cs.utexas.edu
/pub/novak/xgcl-4/ which will over-ride some files and add others.

I looked at the code that includes X10.h; ultimately it looks like
this was never used, so I deleted it.  This is done in new versions
of gcl_general.lsp and general-c.c .

I think you know a lot more than I do about the issues of how to
include XGCL within GCL and compile it.  The way it is done now was
set up by William Schelter.  Anything that is reasonable and works
is okay with me.

As for autoloading, you could use your judgment there.  I don't mind
explicitly loading something.  The XGCL code is not too big, so it
could just be included with GCL if you want.  The thing that is big
is the Xlib; if that is a shared library, it might not be much addition.
On my machine saved_gcl* is 8575667 and saved_xgcl* is 9925314 or +16%.
In the "good old days" 10MB was a lot, but now it is 1% of a PC.

I changed dwtrans.lsp to export symbols.  This should allow users to
just say (use-package 'xlib) and get the symbols that way.  Most of
the symbols are long hyphenated names that should not conflict with
any user symbols, the possible exceptions being MENU, WINDOW, and
STRINGIFY; only STRINGIFY is a function.

The remaining symbols in the file dwimportsb.lsp include some
symbols that might duplicate user symbols, but nobody should need to
load this file except for me when compiling dwindow.lsp .

I updated the documentation dwdoc.tex a bit, including some on the
color editor and Emacs-like editor.  I also put in pointers to my
web site for examples and for pages on how to use this interface
to have an interactive graphical interface to Lisp within a web page.
I converted the dwdoc.tex documentation into .dvi, .ps, .pdf, and .html
versions.

I was able to compile GCL and XGCL last week, but not this week; it
got the following error:
   /usr/lib/libbfd.a(cache.o): In function `bfd_open_file':
   ../../bfd/cache.c:440: undefined reference to `unlink_if_ordinary'
Kay said:
>Does your build really want the staticly linked library?  I would use 
>the shared library if possible.  
The build that did not work is /p/src/gcl-2.6.8pre/
The one that worked is /p/src/gcl-2.6.8prea/

I tested by running the /p/src/gcl-2.6.8prea/unixport/saved_xgcl
and loading my new dwtrans.lsp on top of it.  The file dwtestcases.lsp
has some test cases.

You might try including my /xgcl-4/ files in your build, and we can
see if it works okay.  I will repeat it here as soon as whatever the
compile problem is gets fixed.

This is a bit off the subject, but I wonder if it would be good to
make a WHILE macro part of GCL.  Allegro CL has WHILE (and gives an
error if you try to redefine it), making a bit of a compatibility
problem between GCL and ACL.  Here is the definition I use:
(defmacro while (test &rest forms) `(loop (unless ,test (return)) ,@forms) )

Many thanks for your help with XGCL.

Yigal,

Well, the best way to implement gamma is probably exactly
the way it is done in Recipes - by first implementing the
functions lngamma, P and Q. If you wanted to do that, I think
it would be ok. In general it would be good to be able to
use the algorithms more or less directly from Recipes since
these are so very well known and a lot of thought has gone
into their development.

But the version of gamma that I adapted for SPAD is probably
"good enough" in most cases. The only real issue is that it
does not converge are rapidly as the series approximation in
the case x<=a+1. But the test I did suggest that this is not
really a problem unless you are very worried about performance
and this is not an issue on most modern computers.

I do currently have a technical problem with the SPAD code for
the case of gamma(a,0) - see the web page.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxGamma

It seems to be an issue with the SPAD compiler since I can
successfully compile the same code using the Aldor compiler.
Unfortunately Aldor is not yet easily available with the open
source version of Axiom.

A bigger issue seems to me to be the way Gamma(x) is currently
impletement in Axiom. I was a little horrified to see that it
is actually implemented in BOOT code. Horrified because while
BOOT is (nearly) as readable as SPAD, it is much closer to the
machine level and therefore correspondingly harder to debug.
In my opinion BOOT has it's place at the deeper levels of the
Axiom interpreter and the SPAD compiler itself, but I think this
is completely unnecessary when it comes to Algebra code.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/interp/SfsfunBoot

The second thing is that I do not like the way that the special
functions have been implemented as part of the DoubleFloat
domain. This is quite in contrast to the way that the trignometric
functions have been implemented. One consequence is that it is
hard to control when one wants to treat Gamma(x) symbolically
(as one might do in the case of symbolic integration etc.) and
when to treat it numerically.

For example:

(1) -> sin(1)

   (1)  sin(1)
                                  Type: Expression Integer
(2) -> sin(1)::Expression Float

   (2)  0.8414709848 0789650665
                                    Type: Expression Float
(3) -> Gamma(1)

   (3)  1.0
                                         Type: DoubleFloat
(4) -> Gamma(1,2)
         _
   (4)  | (1,2)
                                  Type: Expression Integer

-----------

I don't think there should be this difference in behaviour
between Gamma(x), Gamma(a,x) and sin(x). Fixing this will
likely require some deeper surgery in Axiom.

Comments from everyone would be most welcome.

I am not quite sure what you mean by "use symbolic capabilities
to numerically compute"? This phrase does not seem to make sense
to me. Could you please explain?

No, I don't think so. Numerical evaluation is the same whether
it is done in Fortran or in SPAD. Actually the word "numerical"
is often miss-used. Really the distinction is between "exact"
and "approximate". Computer algebra systems (CAS) are designed
to be good at exact or symbolic computation but can usually also
do various kinds of approximate or numeric calculation. Fortran
is not so good at symbolic computation, but it is possible.

Perhaps to over state this issue a little: Really there is no
such thing as numeric computation (except perhaps for the
analog simulation engines which are very little used today).
All computation on a digital computer is symbolic by it's very
nature. What we call "numeric" is really just a very specialize
kind of symoblic calculation that is especially suited to
approximate calculations that take account of the technical
limitations of the hardware (memory and word size).

But the code from NR *does* use the continued fraction
method of evaluation the incomplete gamma function!

Axiom's ContinueFraction domain is something else. It's
purpose is to represent a continued fraction in it's full
*exact* infinite form. That's why it is specified in terms
of Streams (infinite lists). Of course this does not mean that
we need infinite memory. Instead what we have is an algorithm
that can produce as many aproximants as we desire and/or have
time and memory available. What you were writing is not a
numerical method, it is really a method for the *exact*
representation of the incomplete Gamma function.

You should read especially the section in the Axiom book
section 9.12 (page 498) about ContinuedFraction. It is important
to understand in what sense the continued fraction:

z := continuedFraction(3,repeating [1],repeating [3,6])

represents sqrt(11) *exactly*. In principle it is possible to
define exactly what one means by

  z*z = continuedFraction(11)

symbolically (exactly). Similarly you could take your
continuedFraction expression for gamma(a,x) and then

  z*gamma(1,2)

is an exact expression.

Then from such exact expressions one can extract the desired
approximant as needed.

All of this is only "in principle" however because Axiom's
ContinuedFraction domain has some serious limitations.

Also, there are some other methods besides continued fractions
that might be a better representation for exact reals.

Axiom already uses GMP.

I agree with your feeling, but I am not entirely sure how to

------=_Part_11711_5587037.1138670456645

First and foremost it is important to realize there is a computational
history before Axiom.  What I think is important from this history is that
several programs have been developed to find approximate results also known
as non-exact or numerical results for problems.  I will call them
approximating programs as a set.  These include Fortran, C, etc..

Now for where I think I differ with you Bill.  Axiom is a CAS.  As such it
has built in capabilities and certain tools that are different than an
approximating programs.  It has the ability to help us solve a problem
exactly.  This makes Axiom as well as all other CAS's vastly different than
approximating programs.

Should Axiom be an all in one computer program for solving math problems?  I
believe this is asking too much for any program.  Should an NR program be
converted to SPAD? As such this is  in my opinion very low if non-existent
on the agenda for improving Axiom.

The one way gpl'd programs have an advantage on proprietary software is that
they can use existing gpl'd programs without worrying about licenses etc..
For instance consider all the work done in Fortran like quadpack etc..
Axiom if asked for a numerical result could if linking was considered could
use the existing libraries to compute practically any function.

In fact this is just the strategy used by the proprietary Axiom.  To link it
to NAG was what was done.  There are plenty of high quality libraries that
can be used for numerical approximations in Fortran that are gpl: lapack is
but one of them.

Is this better than Mathematica?  Well I guess the analogy may be something
like is it better to sleep with many partners than with just one.  By this I
mean, problems of using other programs to calculate numerical values may
include trusting the approximating program that you are using and the
library that it uses to find a numerical value.  That is if many sources are
used then we have to trust each one is not faulty.  Mathematica or Maple
probably rely on there own programs for approximate results.   However there
are trusted libraries to approximately solve math problems that are gpl'd
and that people are working right now on, like GSL.

If I am not seeing the full picture please enlighten me.  Otherwise I do not
understand why any approximation for a function need be incorporated into
SPAD.

'ContinuedFraction' implements general continued fractions.
This version is not restricted to simple, finite fractions and
uses the 'Stream' as a representation.  The arithmetic functions
assume that the approximants alternate below/above the convergence
point. This is enforced by ensuring the partial numerators and
partial denominators are greater than 0 in the Euclidean domain
view of 'R' (i.e. 'sizeLess?(0, x)').

Description:

'ContinuedFraction' implements general continued fractions.
This version is not restricted to simple, finite fractions and
uses the 'Stream' as a representation.  The arithmetic functions
assume that the approximants alternate below/above the convergence
point. This is enforced by ensuring the partial numerators and
partial denominators are greater than 0 in the Euclidean domain
view of 'R' (i.e. 'sizeLess?(0, x)').

I agree completely that a replacement for the NAG interface is
urgently needed for the open source version of Axiom.

I would be very pleased to help anyone who is motivated to

You show 2 problems which causes axiom-source difficult to read :

When I want to understand a function I make a lot of grep on *.spad files
in order to find some interessing lines.
I really do this for the sin function.
I don't imagine that I must read the boot-loader for the gamma function.

The mupad file are in trees ; all files have the same structure.
I send the skeleton of the main igamma function in mupad lib.

There are sin.mu, gamma.mu, igamma.mu, Ei.mu files in the SPECFUNC director=
y.
There are also some igamma implentation in
STDLIB/DIFF/igamma.mu for differential computation
STDLIB/CONJ/igamma.mu for conjugate
SERIES/igamma.mu      for series
...

// B //

When I use axiom I ask (to me) the question :
<< how can I explain this idea (to my students) with very view words >>
And I see it's not so easy to do with Float, Expression Float, DoubleFloat :

> For example:
>
sin(1) :                   sin(1)             Type: Expression Integer
sin(1)::Expression Float                      Right
(sin 1)::Float                                Wrong, Why ?
(2/3)::Float
Gamma(1)                                      Type: DoubleFloat
                                              I prefer Integer
Gamma(1,2)                                    Expression Integer is right.

Thank you! Yes, I think you are right. In this case in SPAD
it appears necessary to distinguish between '1.0' and '1'. As
I understand it in the Axiom interpreter '1.0' is actually
translated as the function 'float(1,0,10)$Domain' and '0.0' as
'float(0,0,10)$Domain' while '1$Domain' is always defined as
the multiplicative identity and '0$Domain' is the additive
identity in any Domain (if it exists). It seems that the SPAD
compiler does not quite get this right without a little more
help.

You were very clever to realize this! :)

Yes you are right. For the domain Float the EPS is adjustable so
we really should compute it, perhaps like this:

(1) -> EPS := (10.0^(-digits()$Float))$Float

   (1)  0.1 E -19
                                             Type: Float

That's the default value but the precision can be adjusted
for example:

(2) -> digits(400)$Float

   (2)  20
                                    Type: PositiveInteger

(3) -> EPS := (10.0^(-digits()$Float))$Float

   (3)  0.1 E -399
                                              Type: Float

But the precision of DoubleFloat is fixed by the machine
representation:

(4) -> digits()$DoubleFloat

   (4)  15
                                    Type: PositiveInteger

(5) -> (1.0+10.0^(-digits()$DoubleFloat)=1.0)$DoubleFloat

   (5)  false
                                              Type: Boolean

(6) -> (1.0+10.0^(-digits()$DoubleFloat-1)=1.0)$DoubleFloat

   (6)  true
                                              Type: Boolean

I have a little more trouble deciding on the value of FPMIN.
In principle in the Float domain there is no minimum floating
point value since the exponent is represented by an arbitrary
precision integer.

In the domain DoubleFloat is seems that FPMIN is approximately:

(7) -> (10.0^-323=0)$DoubleFloat

   (7)  false
                                             Type: Boolean

(8) -> (10.0^-324=0)$DoubleFloat

   (8)  true
                                             Type: Boolean

Is there any Axiom function like 'digits' that I could call to
determine this value?

Anyway, I modified the example at

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxGamma

to test these values and they seem to work.

Thanks. I think Axiom should expose functions like this in the
domains DoubleFloat and in Float. I remain a little confused about
how best to treat the LEAST_-POSITIVE_-LONG_-FLOAT in the case
of Axiom's Float domain.

Yes, it was the same problem that we have been having lately

wastes CPU without accomplishing anything.

It should be ok now.
