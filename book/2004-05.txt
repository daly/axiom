As a side note, I've done my PhD in a research team looking at those
cluster issues (and my own PhD was on the shared memory topic). I doubt
that you can gain any speedup on a beowulf-like cluster for fine grain
computations, due to high cost of communications (to much latency, to
little bandwidth). However, coarse grain parallelism (e.g. one long
Axiom computation par node) seems to me much more doable.

Is this interface simply documented anywhere?  Don't have access to
Franz lisp.  We've been discussing our socket interface recently, and
perhaps now would be the time to solicit opinions on what an optimal
interface would look like.  I take it the Franz interface also suits
the web/mod_lisp people well?

OK, then perhaps we have the basis for a dialog, as I'd feel

Richard,

I'm looking at attaching Axiom as a mod-lisp apache process.
It requires sockets. We have several options to choose from.
Hellmut suggested that we try to be compatible with Franz's 
implementation. I think this is a reasonable idea as it would
be better to have a compatible implementation. Can you point me 
at some documentation for Franz's sockets or point me at someone
who knows?

Subject: creating high quality pdf files

Dear Tim,

there was an discussion about creating high quality pdf files from TeX
source (respectively ps files). I benefitted from a short Makefile a
colleague of mine, Jan Kruerger, hacked in to compile his thesis.
	The relevat part for teh AXIOM book is the one which gives the
options to the p2pdf command, so that good 1.3 fonts (thumbnails etc) are
created. pdfs created this way look quite good.

Perhaps this helps for texing a smoth pdf version of teh AXIOM book, which
could be uploaded to svannah's file area?

I had problems to use pdflatex with more advanced tex files (eg using
pstricks) so I had to use a different approch. Since on this group ps2pdf
was mentioned, it was just a point to make that one can give there
arguments so that 1.3 fonts are used and tumbnails are produced etc. Of
course, more advanced features of pdf can be incorporated only by
pdflatex, but see above
	I was not arguaing against your pdf file anyway.

My own opinion on this is that substituing latex by pdflatex does the
job. Is the PDF version of the Axiom Book I have made of less quality

Subject: Re: [Gcl-devel] Re: Server sockets with GCL?
Cc: Tom Johnson, Chris Hall

Greetings!

A few observations regarding sockets in GCL:

1) There appears to be hooks in the current code for functions which
   were later removed, perhaps as a result of the KCL->GCL migration.
   Look at nsocket.c for the commented out empty function update,
   etc.   

2) From what I can tell, the server function passed to si::socket is
   therefore not currently used.  I've checked all the references to
   object0->c.c... and unless I've missed something, this
   functionality has been removed.

3) The code in file.d goes with the routines in nsocket.c.  The code
   in sockets.c appears to be tcltk specific, going with
   gcl-tk/comm.c.  The magic header bytes are indeed gcl specific
   additions to the protocol to the gcltkserver, presumably as a
   failsafe.  Search for 'magic' in gcl-tk/comm.c.

4) Fixing this is not hard -- its just that it is not clear what is
   best to do.  As we all know, there is no socket standard in the
   ANSI spec.  It has been expressed that compatibility with allegro
   would be desirable, at least for SLIME, but there appears to be no
   multiplexing ability in their implementation.  Presumably this is
   because they count on the user relying on threads for their
   multitasking.  The dominant socket server paradigm of which I am
   aware is 1) bind 2) listen 3) accept 4) fork/spawn, whatever on the
   new socket.  This would be simple to implement in GCL via fork()
   (no Windows), but this would mean running one image per connection,
   which is quite a lot of memory.  Threads reduce this hurdle, but
   they are much harder in lisp, where one has to worry about the GC.
   We won't be able to do that any time soon, at least without some
   detailed pointers/examples of other treatments.  So this might
   indicate that either 1) a multiplexing based on select() or 2) a
   SIGIO based multitasking system might be preferable.  I've had a
   bit of trouble with SIGIO signal handlers restarting some system
   calls on exit in the past -- don't know if this is a permanent
   problem.  

   Presumably one does want to assign some function to handle the i/o
   on the socket *in the background* while returning control to the
   user, no?  Would it not also be preferable to have some sort of
   attach/detach procedure like in gdb to connect and disconnect from
   a running process?

   BTW, noticed on allegro's site that SSL is only supported in
   Enterprise versions.  I've written my own ssl socket multiplexer
   (non-server) in C, which in principle is easily integratable into
   GCL if an interface can be decided upon, using openssl, so maybe
   this would be attractive.

5) Speaking of fork(), I just noticed that we are not even compiling
   in run-process and the like, at least on linux.  Does anyone want
   this back?

Take care,

(a lot of interesting and useful stuff snipped)

It is now clear to me that the level of familiarity with GCL's history
and the physical source file dependencies required to make these changes
is well above my current expertise.  Although I might be able to make the
code work for my platform and distro, I don't have the means to test that
I haven't broken one or more implementations on other platforms, nor to 
generalize the build and configuration process.

Regarding the issues of fork() and threads, yes, I would expect a general
implementation of threads to be necessary to make server sockets as useful
as in other languages (or maybe as in other Lisp implementations, as you 
note). 

However, in the particular situation I face at the moment, my "server" 
need
not be able to (and in fact, cannot currently) serve multiple concurrent 
clients.  Thus, I would be using the server socket only with one client at
a time. 

My main need for now is a function to listen "passively" and produce 
the same sort of thing produced by SI::SOCKET.  I'm not particular whether
the form I employ is a keyword-based option on SI::SOCKET or another 
function
like ACCEPT-SOCKET-CONNECTION altogether.

OK, for this 'quick and dirty':

1) Apply the patch below
2) In GCL: (defun foo (x) x) (setq s (si::socket 1919 :server 'foo))
      (setq q (si::accept s))
3) In some other window, either netcat or telnet localhost 1919
4) IN GCL: accept should return with a cons containing a two way
   stream
5) In other window, type hello
6) In GCL: (read-line (car q)) ; should give "hello"
7) In GCL: (format (car q) "there~%")
8) there should appear in other window.

Not quite ready to commit this as the dummy server function is pretty
ugly.  I think the original intent might have been to define handlers
via the SIGIO-INTERRUPT symbol and the SET-SIGIO-FOR-FD function.

Do we want to specify a server function in this case, and if so, what
do we want it to do and when?

As I mentioned in a related thread, I would like to (humbly) suggest the
select() option - for your reasons here and others mentioned in my
related post.

If we go the select() route, couldn't we use a defstruct/plist/object to
hold functions to be called for the various events (data_available,
connection_lost, etc.)?  This defstruct/plist/object would be returned
from/created by the function creating the associated socket.

As I understand select(), one uses an associated map of fd's for it to
monitor - with just a wee bit of abstraction, mightn't it be possible to
have it use a map of socket defstructs/plist/objects?

I'll come clean - a lot of my ideas are cribbed from the Python standard
lib 'asyncore'.  A brief API description is available at:

http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-asyncore.html

Axiom doesn't seem to compile itself out of CVS.  I had to:

as {\tt true} and {\tt false} rather than true and false when in tex

Sure! pdflatex is a full featured latex with some restrictions concerning the

If you have *.eps figures epstopdf will do the job of conversion, I'm not
quite sure how to convert from eps to png but I think ImageMagick will be the

similar to the way TeX is handled. I'm going to look at what
it might take to get this working (and, as a side-effect, get

You should be able to pass an expression to Axiom with the

Actually, I'm writing up the (new) quarterly Axiom report and this

with a (latex -> dvi -> advi -> borderless miniwindow) kind of hack.

It was a misunderstanding on my part as I was unaware that MMA files

Do you consider FeynCalc useful and worth the effort to port?
If so, it might make a useful test case for writing some programs
to extract MMA information. There is still a long distance between
MMA and Axiom and, unfortunately, the path travels thru someone's

http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathreader/

It's not clear to me how this would help, unless
you are looking to duplicate the graphical display
of Mathematica.  The concepts will have to be 
translated from Mathematica's world to Axiom's (or
Maxima's for that matter) and that will be the
hard part.

As I understand it, Dr. Fateman's mockmma package
could be used to do a rough translation, which would
then need much work and probably some redesign to 
actually take the rest of the way to a reliable working 
program.  I'm guessing Axiom is more different from 
Mathematica than Maxima is, at least in approach.  
Undoubtedly an Axiom version of Feyncalc would be 
a powerful tool though - perhaps the different design
decisions of Axiom would actually be an asset :-).

Having Axiom and Maxima versions of Feyncalc would be 
really excellent - each system could serve as a check
on the accuracy of the other.  Keeping both current would
be a bit of work though.

There is an axiom command 'document' that gets built which knows about
pamphlet files and creates .dvi files. I'm going to hack that command
so you can request the target file format (dvi, ps, pdf). You should
be able to use it by doing:

export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
document foo                    <=== note: note foo.pamphlet, just foo

currently 'document' extracts the .tex and creates a .dvi file.

I really should figure out how to transfer this information from the
configure script and make it part of the configuration. Plus configure
should check that the various pdf/ps/bibtex commands exist and work.

Actually, there is an axiom.bib.pamphlet file that contains a huge amount
of bib references. I just haven't posted it yet. I'll add it to the TODO
list. I ripped out the bibtex step when I posted the book because I wanted
the book to be as close to a standalone file as I could get (module the
graphics). 

I'm working on a second book about fundamental math concepts (like
polynomial gcd) which is using the bibtex step so I'll need it 
eventually. The book is intended for beginning Axiom computer algebra
users and is based on D.E. Littlewood's "The Skeleton Keys of Mathematics".

I would be very, very interested in such a thing, however, maintaining
three separate codebases would really really suck.

The Mathematica language is the largest I have ever seen.  It attempts
to be all things, list-based, object-based, functional, patterns,
interpreted, compiled, and of course has an extremely large library.
Automatic translation from Mathematica may be near impossible.  Frankly
I think the size of the language makes it poorly suited to almost all
tasks, and I hope Axiom and Maxima do not attempt to emulate it.

Rather, it may be easier to develop a MMA export mode for Axiom/Maxima
for the purpose of comparing solutions.  An export mode doesn't need to
understand the entire MMA language.  I would like to see a large,
cross-system test suite which could be used to validate and improve all
systems.  Perhaps this:
    http://www.math.unm.edu/~wester/cas_review.html
would be a good starting point.

In any case, I am extremely interested in this and would like to help.
I have a pile of Maple code for my use, dealing with supersymmetric
lagrangians, feynman rules, etc, and I intend to re-implement it in
Axiom or Maxima, and doing so as part of a larger package would be
ideal.

True, but unavoidable if people want the system to work on different
systems.  My hope would be that once the basic ports are complete, as
changes are made to the Mathematica codebase the maintainers of the
Maxima and/or Axiom ports would be able to examine those changes and
take the appropriate steps in their codebases.  Essentially, the
developers doing the new scientific coding would keep doing the
Mathematica thing and the porters could just impliment that in the
other systems.  May or may not be workable - partially it depends on
how actively developed the Feyncalc software is.

That was my general impression as well.  I don't advocate automatic
translation.  You never know - perhaps Axiom or Maxima might someday
take over as the primary Feyncalc platform - a Mathematica license as
an entry fee for running Feyncalc can be a hefty price for a physics
department, particularly if they anticipate a lot of users.

AFAIK most of Axiom and Maxima's language decisions were made a long
time ago.

Sounds interesting!  For what it's worth, there has been some work done
previously translating Maple code to Maxima - can't recall the details

Why bother?  MMA's output mechanism is identical to that of presentation
MathML (they basically donated it to the W3C group), so if you got Axiom
to generate presentation MathML instead of OutputFormat then you could
use Mozilla or Internet Explorer (or any other MathML viewer) to display
your mathematical output.  It would be much faster than going via dvi,
and provide some limited cut-and-paste interoperability with Mathematica
and MathML.

It is clear from numerous discussions that Axiom needs to develop a
notebook-like interface. Several people told me that they don't use
Axiom specifically because it lacks a notebook.

So, what are the choices? 

MMA uses ascii text as their notebook representation. It would be useful
to generate "compatible" input/output so we could use the same front-end.
However, the front-end is closed, proprietary, and expensive. Donating
the representation of the math to W3C doesn't address the real issue.

I can't use the Maple front-end for the same reasons.

I'd like to use Integre's (formerly IBM's) techexplorer and MathML editor
but their license specifically states that I can't:

        The license rights granted hereunder are limited to
  non-commercial personal use of the Software. Without limitation, the
  license rights granted hereunder DO NOT include the right to use the
  Software from within a commercial third-party application that
  requires use of the Software, unless that third party publisher has
  purchased a distribution license from Integre. Please contact Integre
  with questions about use of the Software within third party
  applications.

Thus I'm left with no choice but to waste a year of my life drawing
pretty pictures of characters on a screen. OpenMath and MathML only
address a very small portion of the problem and, worse yet, add limits
to the data representation I can choose. And I don't see how to carry
Axiom's Types in OpenMath's data representation. Another incompatible
notebook simply fragments the computational mathematics domain into
yet another pointless "camp". Believe me, I'd much rather spend my 
time using other people's work and get on with making the math better.

I believe TeXmacs is intended as a general-purpose math front-end.
Unfortunately the reaction I hear is that TeXmacs presents itself
as an editor rather than a notebook. The look-and-feel is different.
Editors are like wives, you usually only have one and it is very
hard to change.

It is possible to use the TeXmacs sources to get 90% of the work
done and change the presentation to be more notebook-like. It seems,
based on my limited discussions, that the key issues are the folding
paradigm and the notebook-to-pamphlet data compatibility (i.e. changing
the notebook changes the pamphlet and vice-versa).

Bill Page's wiki might be an interesting alternative path. I tried to
write a webpage that "folds" but my javascript isn't up to the task.
And I'm still pondering how to get the wiki pages back into the 
booklet/pamphlet/tex format. Ideally you could change the book in the
wiki and have it reflected in the pdf.

This woudl amount to post two ToDo points to challenge teh TeXmacs
developers

* Add a folding mechanism which allows to fold and unfold in several
document hirarchies like paragraphs, secions, chapters

* Add an export filter which produces pamphelt files from TeXmacs
documents

I think at least the first should be possible for them, since all
applications would benefit from such a feature, the second, hmmm..

The latex+wiki is really beyond everything I was intended to belive!!
However, it looks odd, if renered text (included as image) and usual text
(rendered by the html engine/browser) are mixed. Moreover, it is a bit of
cheating involved. The creator of such a page has to deal with bootom down
LaTeX and wiki(html) formating issues. This is fare away from being a
wysiwyg application.
	Really challenging would be a web site where you can drag and drop
elements arrond (among them there may be AXIOM_INPUT elements and
AXIOM_OUTPUT elemenst) without going into the details of formating.
However, this seems to be a remote thing to think of.

So the pragmatical question:

What is the present AXIOM comunity and would it enlarge (gramatically) if
a GUI (other than TeXmacs) would be awailable?

what's wrong with TeXmacs?

Please note:

- I saw a book entirely written in "Matehmatica", printed it looks (in my
  eyes) awful. It's hard to beat (AMS,La,..)TeX

- The maple gui of Maple 9.0 has turned many people away from the product
  (if those who announced to do so really did). This interface does not
  support presentations, eg on a conference, and has a very very limited
  typographical capability.

- If you spend too much effort into a GUI, most likely the backend will
  suffer. A person from scientific computing, some times ago told me that
  Maple is really going for the engineers and students, not primarily for
  scientists. If AXIOM would / will try to do this, I think the typed
  language will be a barrier never surmounted by engineers, and most
  students and even many scientists.

- A point may be, that AXOM is still not available for windows (am I
  right?)

So my conclusion would be to take TeXmacs, and to try to have an export
function of AXIOM "worksheets" to ps/pdf. Pdf can be used for
presentations, even if real computations are not possible.

The main point of concern is, to specify the targeted user....

sure. the analogy is even stronger. you'll notice, if you switch
editors or remarry, that almost nothing you learned from the first
transfers to the second. And for some really nasty breakups (e.g.

I'd have thought that it did.  Everything else that you need is already
freely available in browsers, implemented according to defined or
de-facto standards.  You can do text layout in XHTML, implement fancy
folding menus with javascript, handle graphics with plug-ins to get
interactivity and render the Maths with MathML.  If you want a hard-copy
on the other hand, then its very easy to write an XSL stylesheet to
produce LaTeX from your original document, or you can probably find
existing tools to do this on the web.  This isn't fantasy by the way,
its exactly what we are doing at NAG with our documentation and its
proving very successful.

I don't see how they limit your data representation, especially since

You use the OMATTR constructor to attribute the object with its Axiom
type.  (In OpenMath 2 you can make this stronger by declaring it to be a
semantic attribute.)  MathML has an element called "semantics" which
allows you to do a similar thing, there is a whole document devoted to
this problem at http://www.w3.org/TR/mathml-types/.

Thats why if I were in your position I would try and use generic
technologies inside a browser, rather than do something ad-hoc.

I agree that the notebook form is painful and limited for some
things but it clearly has the attention of users. I want much
more from the user interface. I'm sure there will be better
ideas when we reach the 30 year horizon but what will they be?

Frankly, I'd like a user interface that knows much more about
the mathematics, both for specific domain lookup (ala the javadoc
hierarchy) so that I can find information about a domain and the
categories it belongs to, the lattice of types where it resides,
the pamphlets that are related to it, the published papers where
it is referenced, and websites that are related.

I also want the user interface to know much more about the user's 
intentions, by watching what the user is doing. I know this sounds
a lot like clippy but in the long term I can fork off whole processors
to scan the mathematics literature. In the short term I want the user
interface to experiement with collecting and representing information
about the task I'm trying to do.

The user interface needs to know about the language and the compiler
and it needs to know examples of the functions I'm trying to call.

All of which means that there needs to be a great deal of information
provided by Axiom to the front-end and tight coupling to things like
context-sensitive menu items.

I suggest we form a plan that addresses all of the concerns
e.g. mathml, openmath, notebook-like, texmacs, tex, ps, pdf,
pamphlets, etc. 

If we target the texmacs codebase we could likely get help from them
and also benefit both of us.

This is because the axiom site is inside Plone, and Plone needs a
ploneCustom.css file to specify a few things for latexwiki.  See my
site: http://mcelrath.org/Notes which does not use plone.  I've put a
lot of effort into making the latex text look natural with the
surrounding browser text.  Also try the "preferences" link in the upper
left corner.

In general, I do not think a web page would be an appropriate interface
for Axiom.  Furthermore, png/gif's embedded in web pages for the math is
really a short-term hack because MathML isn't ready for prime time, and
is not desirable in the long run.

However, Mozilla has just about all the elements necessary to build a
notebook interface.  It can render MathML already, and an interface can
be drawn in XUL...  Perhaps this would be better than extending
TeXmacs, since the "notebook" doesn't fit so naturally in the editor
paradigm.

Perhaps a GUI developed for one CAS, if it uses a sufficiently open
license, could become the "standard" UI that everyone can plug their
programs into?  I've thought about this when considering an McCLIM GUI
for Maxima - if it is written without using Maxima code itself, and
licensed under the BSD license, Axiom could then use the same UI code
and just make the bridge between the interface graphics and the Axiom
syntax.  Indeed, if sockets communication is used, in theory ANY system
could use it as an interface.

Here's my opinion, for what it's worth.  Don't worry about a notebook
interface anytime soon - there's a lot more to do on the Axiom core
first.  An interface should be considered when Axiom is stable and
feature complete enough for a major push into end user territory, at
least IMHO.  Maxima has essentially chosen to set the priorities on
making a completely solid math core (at least as much as possible :-) 
and THEN worrying about a GUI to sell it to the users.  Axiom may be
further along on the math core part, so perhaps y'all are already
there.  Anyway, if you feel it would be a waste of your time to do a
GUI then my advice is don't worry about it - do what you like and/or
think is a good use of your time.  Serious users will be fine with the
text interface, and adding a GUI too early might lead people to expect
more than is currently there.  Just some thoughts.

I don't think the notebooks fragment the community any more than the
systems themselves do - it isn't reasonable to, say, expect Mathematica
to open a Maple notebook since the feature sets are different.  My
ideal answer to the open source math notebook question (probably
different from everyone else's ;-) would be:

a) be lisp based (since the two largest open source symbolic CASs are
in lisp, and they will have the most incentive to maintain them, it
makes a certain amount of sense.  Plus all the goodness of doing it in
lisp in the first place.)

b) would utilize things like cl-typesetting and cl-pdf to have native
ability to export nicely formatted documents, and also export to clean
LaTeX for TeX fans and MathML for web.  Any math expression the
interface doesn't know how to render is simply rendered as it is see in
the input.

c) would have all the logic dealing with communication with and
translation of various CASs contained in one place, and well documented
to allow for easily adapting the system to another CAS.

d) would have its own interactive graphing capabilities tuned to CAS
oriented tasks, both for better graphing and to eliminate cross
platform plotting issues.

e) more stuff I'm not thinking of right now, and any brilliant UI ideas
anybody has had but has had no framework to try them out.  Another
benefit of Lisp would be that extensions would be simple to write and
add, if the codebase and apis are clean and well defined.  For example,
a package like Feyncalc could load interface elements specifically
designed to help with high energy physics type work.  Or for a lab a
package could be coded where the interface essentially becomes whatever
is ideal for each stage of the lab - the instructor could limit the UI
to show only the relevant components, and define some custom ones if
desired. I'm guessing doing such things in a non lisp language in a
cross platform matter wouldn't be so straightforward, but that's just a
guess.

Drawbacks - lots of people don't know lisp and don't want to learn,
which might limit people from wanting to customize the GUI, McCLIM
would need to have backends implimented on platforms the CASs are
interested in running on, implimenting 3D interactive plotting would
take some work (probably true anywhere though).

TeXmacs is very, very nice for editing a document and inserting some
math here and there.  But from what I understand it doesn't have the
flexibility to do things like Mathematica's button panels (pros may not
like em but they're a godsend when new users are working), interactive
graphics, or 2D input.  Perhaps it will eventually become the frontend
of choice, but my instincts tell me that an interface designed
specifically to be an interface to a CAS might be better for certain
types of use.

Not currently - I think GCL still has ANSI issues to work out.  I'm

implimenting the spec first, and porting will probably come later. 
(Although, I've never actually tried on the newer CVS ansi images -

Agreed.  :-).  I imagine you probably have lots if ideas, but I had an
idea for a "parenthesis matching plus" GUI mode to help people entering
expressions keep track of nesting.  Syntax used is Maxima's but it
would probably work the same way for Axiom, if you're interested.
http://maxima.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/CY%27s%20conceptual%20stuff

We bounced a lot of GUI thoughts back and forth on the Maxima list
before we decided we should get a math program built :-).  Worth
keeping an eye on are the STIX fonts (www.stixfonts.org) which
hopefully could someday do for an McCLIM gui what Mathematica's fonts
do for their UI, only hopefully looking better while doing it ;-).

BF,

I looked at the cliki.net website. 
I see Maxima is listed under the Mathematics link.
I couldn't find a package for graphics under lisp
but I found out that there is a tcl/tk toolkit link in GCL.
Once I figure out how to handle the sockets issue I'll look
into the tck/tk link.

An Axiom entry would probably also be appropriate.

Yes, I don't think there is really a good one yet.  McCLIM has some
sort of 2D graphing capabilities under development, but I don't know
much about it - scigraph I think they call it?

> but I found out that there is a tcl/tk toolkit link in GCL.

Eurrrg.  I don't know if that has been tested in a serious way in
years.  I recall some discussion about it a while back on the gcl
archives - Camm, if you're on this list can you give us a status
update?

I don't know if tcl/tk is the best environment for a notebook interface
- it would probably be difficult to port a gcl/tcl/tk GUI to other
lisps.  If only gcl support is important than it might be a way to go. 
Otherwise, if a cross-implimentation UI must be developed I'd recommend
McCLIM over tcl/tk - IIRC dealing with the tcl/tk code in xmaxima
wasn't much fun.

Since Maxima is GPL I guess the socket code itself can't be used, but
you might be able to use the technique?

Maybe this would also be of help:

It seems the best path forward would be to:

  modify OpenMath domain to work with )set output openmath on

I'm trying to port Christian Krattenthaler's Mathematica program rate (= 
german for "guess!"), which guesses formulas for sequences of numbers 
given the first few terms, however, I failed somehow. 

Here are my questions, which proved to be obstacles: (I tried to be as 
concise as possible)

--------------------- first obstacle ------------------------


it seems that I need an own version of product:

(1) -> f == n +-> product(product(i,i=1..j),j=1..n)
                                                                   Type:

(2) -> f(n)

   (2)   | |    | |   i
         | |    | |
        j= 1   i= 1

   >> Error detected within library code:

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Note that I would want my program to spit out a sum as in (2), but 
certainly I would want it to be evaluable.

Furthermore, I'm having a problem spitting out something like

product(x^i,i=1..n)

where x is a fractional polynomial over PF 2, for example... What's the
type of this thing, EXPR PF 2 does not work, of course. I cannot simply
take EXPR INT, since my factors can be functions from INT into any
(infinite) field.

I tried 

 g(i:INT):FRAC UP(x,PF 2) == x^i+1

however, this does not work, of course:

f(n:INT):FRAC UP(x,PF 2) == product(g(i),i=1..n)

a little better is

 f(n:INT):FRAC UP(x,PF 2) == reduce(*,[g(i) for i in 1..n])

in which case I don't get f(n) for symbolic n however...

In fact, it seems to me that I'd need a EXPR domain which does not need 
OrderedSet...

Any ideas?

Agreed.  In general, I know of no broad area of symbolic computation
which would present an easy basis for coarse grain factorization.  And
the systems we are discussing don't seem to do numerical work much,
though if they did, the obvious thing to do would be to interface with
blas/lapack interfaces, which can be made binary compatible with
automatically tuned versions (atlas, which can be multithreaded) and
possibly parallel versions, e.g. pblas, scalapack.

Short term, probably.  Long term...  well, in long term we can just

There was a serious user of gcl-tk on the gcl list recently.  To my
knowledge the interface is quite servicable.  There is nothing
particularly gcl specific about the tk interface code to my
knowledge.  And TK itself is likely far more portable and widely used
than McCLIM, even perhaps than lisp in general :-).

There is also cl-gtk, which works in GCL.

The big issue in my eyes here is that no one likely wants to be a GUI
expert, so something that is as trouble free as possible has a higher
premium than something elegant or advanced in terms of UI concepts.
So honestly I think the best route for newish projects is to use
cl-gtk, relying on the enormous user base of gtk, the compiled
efficiency of the code, and friendly tools like glade for making user
interfaces graphically.  On ecan even change the UI with a runtime
sources xml type file.  

Lisp is so great in general that there is an aversion to doing things
outside it, but I think this can just slow things down after a point.

Hi,

as fare as I understand the package (havn't though done much with it, so I
might be wrong), it is designed for very "practical" purpose (ie
phenomenology.) Many problems can be subsummarized in a larger frame of
mathematics. Given the type system of AXIOM, it would be, in my eyes, a
fraud to implement something like "Dirac matrixes" and trace rules, while
this is a closed structure in a *-autonomous category. However, I am still
not able myself to give AXIOM code for such a vast general thing.

Most CAS do _not_ document actual algorithms. Its even very difficult (as
a non expert)= to find/lookup the currently favored algorithms (for say
comparison with own better(?) ones). So I consider the pamphlet idea to be
one of the most important of AXIOM and would support a FeynCalc package
iff its really _fully_ documented via pamphlet format _including_ all
algorithmical details.

CY, Camm,

I spent last night running the gcl-tk demos in GCL. The secret to 
getting them to run, which you probably already know, is to 
preceed loading the demo code with:

(in-package "TK")
(tkconnect)

which didn't seem to be documented anywhere.

Anyway, most of them worked although I got some strange error messages
and undefined variables for some cases (e.g. demos-4.2/widget.lisp)
(I was surprise to learn that ".t" was a valid lisp identifier.
What mind could construct such a beast?)

I'll scratch up a simple example once I figure out how to write a tcl/tk
program. 

What language is the maxima GUI written in? 
Can we generalize that to work for Axiom?
That way we can share GUI efforts between Axiom and Maxima.

I'm also the lead developer on Magnus, another special-purpose computer
algebra system, and I'm having the same struggle. I'm currently writing
documentation for the system and need to describe the algorithms, some
of which have never been written down before. It is a painful process
to describe an algorithm from computer code, especially when it is
written by programmers who don't really understand the theory. 

We need to keep the theory and the code together and have each one
explain the other. How else can you show that the code does what it
is intended to do?

That's why I'm interested in the papers behind FeynCalc. If we can
get it into a literate format the code can be maintained for several
systems. But if we have to maintain and port code without the 
underlying theory the task is hopeless.

The *purpose* of FeynCalc is to be a general purpose framework for doing
quantum field theory calculations.  That is, dirac matrices, trace
rules, Feynman rules from Lagrangians, representations for fields and
the like.

It also contains code for doing one-loop integrals.  This same code
exists in several places (I know of a fortan library "ff" and a Maple
package "xloops" as well), and I can point to the papers if people
desire.  But the loop code is only half of FeynCalc.

The actual algorithms are straightforward, but very tedious to
calculate, so thus the results are collected into libraries like
FeynCalc.  There are yet a handful of obstacles in dealing with
divergences that have kept us from writing a fully automatic method of
computing these loop integrals.  At one loop I think it can be fully
automatic, but I do not think this is something a non-expert would want
to tackle.

The "algorithms" are documented in QFT textbooks such as Peskin &
Schroeder "An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory", Weinberg "Quantum
Theory of Fields", etc.  This is a one-year graduate level physics
course.  The decomposition of loop integrals into scalar integrals was
done by Passarino and Veltman
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(79)90234-7

To illustrate one of the pitfalls, consider the well-known
books "Numerical Recipes in X"  for various programming languages
X  (Fortran, C, Pascal, Lisp??).
Some people are very enthusiastic about these books, but they
are usually people who area not experts in numerical methods.
The attraction of the recipes is that they are easy to understand.
The problem with the recipes is that they are easy to understand,
and are therefore not robust and/or efficient.

An analogy might be to airplanes.  You probably feel safer
in a Boeing 747 -- a plane which is too complicated for you to
understand, but which has been extensively tested,
than an ultra-light airplane using a lawn-mower engine and
built out of wood and nylon fabric.  Even though the ultra-light
airplane might be understandable to you.

You can use an algorithm copied out of Numerical recipes, (or
from von zur Gathen's Modern Computer Algebra,) but these would be like
the ultra-light version. Containing the 10% of the code that
does most of the problem, most of the time, but sweeps some
problems under the rug.

If you want something engineered to be robust and efficient,
you will have to look elsewhere, perhaps in Maxima, Axiom, etc.
Or maybe not even in those systems.

besides which, if you have theory and code together, they
may not be mutually supportive. One of the problems is
that they may not even agree!

A better approach may be to have the code derived automatically
and correctly from the theory, and then automatically optimized.
A difficult problem in general, but something done in part
by compilers.

In fact I've faced the same issue with my work on the Andrews-Curtis
Conjecture. Simply put, this takes a finite representation of a special
group and applies one of 12 transformation functions iteratively
looking for the identity element.

The initial algorithm is clear but garbage collects like mad (lisp).
The second iteration modifies list storage in place but string-conses.
The third algorithm modifies strings in place but copies on overflow.
The fourth algorithm caches power-of-2 strings (binary buddy).

So the literate program explains the theory and then explains the
first algorithm. Next it explains the problem and its subsequent
refinement. Only the last refinement is extracted but the "thought
processes" leading from the initial implementation up to the efficient
form of the algorithm are presented. 

Simply because the code is highly optimized is no reason not to 
include the theory or the steps across the impedence gap.

curiously, the clifford package emerged out of the mind of Rafal whene
refereeing a paper based on extensive mathematica computations. Since he
had no chance to recalculate or understand, he programed a set of maple
(just that was on his computer) routines to check the claims (which were

to compleete the functionality, by now, over 120 functions and over 750

I know this is a research problem though hardly one that merits papers
on the subject, I guess. 

My goal isn't to solve physics/math problems. My goal is to build a system
that will be used by computational mathematicians 30 years from now. Once
this is the stated goal several things become clear.

One clear problem that every system suffers from is that the research
papers are disconnected from the code. Mathematicians do the research
and programmers do the code. Usually it is the same person with two
mindsets. So the math mindset writes the theory with theorems and 
proofs then publishes it, possibly making claims (with no way to
verify the claims by others). The programmer mindset writes the code
which hopefully correctly implements the theory but never publishes it.
Or publishes it as a "contribution" to some system.

Consider the issues this raises for computational mathematicians.

First, claims are made which cannot be reproduced. Citing results of
the program runs without presenting the programs is equivalent to 
citing theorems without providing proofs. How can a referee properly
review such work? Physics and chemistry require reproduced results
before claims are accepted.

Second, the programs are either not available or published as 
contributions. In the first case who is to know if the actual reason
for an algorithmic speedup turns out to be a compiler switch rather
than some theoretical reason like term ordering in a groebner basis
computation? Since it is unpublished the code is likely to die thus
undermining both the basis for the claim and the possibility that
other researchers can build on the work.

The second case is even worse in some sense. I have 1100 domains
in Axiom (some of which I wrote) and 100+ algorithms in Magnus
with no theoretical documentation; indeed most have no documentation
at all. In the 30 year view how is the next generation supposed to
build upon the work we've done so far? How can they see the evolution
of algorithms? How can they maintain the code without the theory?

Axiom represents over 30 years and over 300 man-years of research.
I don't believe that there will be funding to build systems that are
this large and this general. Even if one funded such an effort we
end up with a lot of rework that virtually no-one wants to do.

So I'm proposing a goal for the 30 year horizon. We need to make an
effort to collect the theory and the code and reunite the two. I
realize that there are issues. 

One issue is, as you point out, that code has to deal with grubby
details which the theory can skip. But real design choices are made
when reducing theory to practice and these design choices greatly
affect the results. We need to encourage the practice of explaining
these design decisions. For example, how are infinite objects (like
groups) represented? We have learned that in simple domains like
polynomials there are a wide range of design choices (dense, sparse,
recursive, etc) that are appropriate for different problems. 

Another issue is that current systems don't "reach up" close enough to
the theory. The gap between the theory and the implementation (I call
it the impedance mismatch) is too large for most systems.  For
instance, Magnus is implemented in C++ which is WAY too close to the
machine and very, very far away from Infinite Group Theory (the Magnus
domain). Thus the burden of crossing this gap falls on the
programmer. Systems like Axiom are much closer to the mathematics. But
not close enough. We need systems that span this gap in carefully
structured ways so we can be efficient without being obscure.
This is one of the root causes of your comment that "the
practical implementation of the algorithm is often connected to the
published algorithm in complicated ways". The implemented algorithm
should not be much longer than the published one.

If we look at the 30 year horizon it is clear that all papers in
computational mathematics will be online. We must set standards
now, or at least strive for good examples, that make it possible
to use the research effectively. In today's terms we should be
able to "drag and drop" a computational mathematics paper onto
a system like Axiom and have it immediately available. (In 30
year terms Axiom should know the "intentional stance" of the
researcher and automatically incorporate the algorithms). 

One of the key problems is that "Computational Mathematics" is
like "Computer Science" was 30 years ago. Comp Sci was a branch
of the Math dept (numerical analysis), Engineering (circuit 
minimization), or Business (spreadsheets). It was not recognized
as its own subject with yet. 

Today Computational Mathematics is growing out of Math (research
papers with no code), Comp Sci (research papers in polynomial
representation), Physics (clifford algebras, hopf algebras), or
Engineering (matrix methods), etc. It is not recognized as its
own subject yet (at least not everywhere. Risc-Linz, UWO, Waterloo,
and a few other places seem to have done so).

My current religious zealotism and wild-eyed, irrational planning
(I admit it's over-the-top-painful) claim is that we need to start
with an old idea "Literate Programming" and evolve it to suit the
needs of the next generation Computational Mathematician. Thus
all of Axiom (and soon Magnus) has been rewritten into TeX documents.
There are no C, Lisp, Spad, Makefile, etc files. Now I'm trying to
ensure that new code added to the system includes the theory (or
at least permission to use the paper so I can write the literate
document).

Thus I would really like to see the papers that provide the theory for
FeynCalc as well as the code. If I can write one of the algorithms in
Axiom in a few dozen lines that would be much clearer than a few
thousand lines of C and I'd have the research paper attached.

It's a hard problem but we have 30 years to solve it.

Interesting, I will look into this.  I know only the feynman graph

I am rather toward the user-of-FeynCalc side rather than the
invent-new-field-theoretic-techniques side.  If your Hopf algebra
methods are more efficent then I'm very interested...

I think the future of mathematics is for experts (such as yourself)
implementing and maintaining their favorite piece of math.  Clearly math
software can't evolve like normal Open Source because of the expertise
involved.  But it is critical for math to be open, especially as it
becomes more and more complicated, and more things become intractible to
do by hand.

FeynCalc involves a significant amount of "interface" for writing
lagrangians, etc that may not be appropriate for literal translation,
due to language differences.  It may be worth thinking hard about a
re-implementation of the functionality rather than a direct port.

Hi,

9I am in the unfortunate situation to have to develop the code for
my research on my own, or in a two person collaboration. Of course, being
not a programmer, my algorithms are for sure badly implemented. However,
"help" I received in the past, was mostly inspired from the conventional
theory and _failed!_ in many cases to produce correct results.

9Trying to check my code against theorems, it was not so seldom,
that the program failed to produce the claim. In a few of these cases not
the program but the theorems were wrong! (assuming mostly things for
granted which are not, so that pathological situations occure). Doing such
work, I think, can only perfomed by persons which are living in both parts
of the game, ....

Hence, for challenging problems, ie new math! and phys!, I would _reject_
the lates goodies programmers can provide and favour to have a stable, as
simple as possible, if possible provable algorithm. New goodies, may be
later added (in a separate pamphlet file <grin>, also by people who do not
fully understand the theory and purpose of the program. They can then
check against the slow but stable code. This method at least led me to
stable and reasonable fast code, which at the and was relatively complex.

9On the other hand, concrete mathematics (see the book of this name
coathored by D. Knuth) will at the end be also effective mathematics. If a
problem is _really_ understood, it will have a plain (that is not
necessarily a simple!) solution which can be straightly implemented.

That is a very hard problem in general.

Good algorithms (as opposed to naive ones) are often connected to 
theory
in complicated ways -- just look at published algorithms.  Then the
practical implementation of the algorithm is often connected to the
published algorithm in complicated ways.

"Literate programming" is effective when the algorithm has a nice
hierarchical structure, but there are many tricks that good algorithm
designers and programmers use which don't fit well into that structure.
Some years ago, I participated in a conference on transformational
programming where Tarjan talked about this... it was humbling.

Personally, I think this is a fascinating area, but it really is a
research problem in itself.  So if your goal is solving physics/math
problems, I would recommend that you be pragmatic about how far you go
in trying to systematize the transition from theory to code.

Test cases.

While this does not *prove* the correctness of the code in a
mathematical sense, it does in a monte-carlo sense.  I note that both
maxima and axiom have test suites.

I do not think new mathematical code or subsystems should be accepted
unless they are accompanied by a thorough test suite.

If you mean xmaxima, it's written in tcl/tk and communicates via
socket.  My guess is it would be trivially simple for someone who knows
tcl/tk to adapt it to work with Axiom as long as Axiom supports the
same communication method, assuming this is something you want to do. 
xmaxima, to my understanding, is little more than a tcl/tk framework
around the maxima command shell.  

As long as Axiom is able to communicate via a socket, my guess is it
would be possible to make any GUI which is sufficiently general in its
programming style to work with both systems.  I'm not sure xmaxima is
what you're looking for in a GUI though.

A minor but I think important point is that such concerns are a very
sound argument for making a computer algebra system portable across
multiple computer systems and lisp implimentations.  Even a properly
documented mathematical program depends on the proper (or at least
expected) behavior from the software on top of which it runs.  Getting
identical results from different lisps/operating systems/platforms is a
good check that all levels of the system are operating as expected when
solving a problem.

I'd say its not worse, but it does replace "impossible" with "extremely
difficult".  Closed and vanished code can never be puzzled out,
undocumented code can be figured out if the motivation is sufficiently
strong.  In most cases it will not be, and the work will still be lost,
so I agree the practical results in the two cases will be similar.

Indeed, funding would be made more difficult by the existance of
commercial competitors as well - funding for re-inventing the wheel
would be even harder to find than someone willing to do the work.

Agreed.  I would argue, though, that the priority list should look
something like this:

1.  Well documented and understood.
2.  Efficient (without being platform specific)

Computers are fast enough in this day and age that the far more
important problem is to understand what is happening. If an application
demands sacrificing portability and clarity for speed, that's where a
special purpose program is useful.  Then perhaps Axiom could output the
logic that solves the problem on the Axiom level in some programming
language, and let the programmers fiddle from that point.

Well, at the very least an implimentation of the algorithm is likely to
need to tell Axiom things assumed in the paper.  I suspect this would
be  one of the sticky points in this type of work - implicit
assumptions made through much of a subfield, but which are hard for
newcomers to find and adsorb.  By the same token, it could prove
helpful to be able to easily look back on what those assumptions are.

Which brings up the issue of making sure a paper knows what to tell
Axiom.  I suspect what might happen (and might be a good way of doing
it) is that Axiom based papers will reference other Axiom based papers
as dependancies for their paper.  (I guess this is what you've had in
mind Tim?)  In some sense, perhaps it would even be possible to examine
the implications of some alternative algorithm on other papers - i.e.
are the results obtained using *new algorithm* in the papers that
depend on *old algorithm* impacted by the change?

Two questions:

1) Are you hoping to eventually integrate Magnus's capabilities into
Axiom?

2) Is there some systematic approach that should be put in place for
how to go back and document what's already there?  I.E., start with the
most basic code and document one's way up the capabilities?

This brings up an interesting point.  Much of the discussion so far has
been on how to incorporate new knowledge into Axiom/etc as it is
discovered/created, but for a lot of uses the PRACTICAL value of a CAS
is doing repeated calculations within a subset of mathematics. 
Modeling physical systems, for example, most likely allows one to make
some assumptions that a general purpose CAS wouldn't or shouldn't make.

If Axiom is to be useful to people in a field outside pure mathematical
research (such as high energy physics) there should be a way for them
to have a HighEnergyPhysics.pamphlet file or some such that immediately
lets Axiom know about the standard assumptions in the field.  That way,
anyone wanting to write a paper using Axiom in the HighEnergyPhysics
field could simply load that file and have a mathematical environment
corresponding to the one they use to do their work.  I guess Feyncalc
in a sense is such a tool for Mathematica, but given the strictness of
Axiom's environment I wouldn't be surprised if Feyncalc itself might
benefit from a more general definition file.

Perhaps it would be useful to make the distinction between mathematical
research using a CAS and the CAS as a scientific tool.  Axiom clearly
wants to be a mathematical research level CAS - does it make sense to
add abilities which are mostly practical in nature?  I.e., would Axiom
want to be the place to do quick calculations for a physics paper, as
well as an environment to interact with high level mathematical
research?  I don't think the two are mutually exclusive, but I'm
thinking there does need to be a way for the casual user to be isolated
from advanced mathematical issues and define a more confined working
environment.

I think he's refering to the difficulties of defining a protocal to use
when performing this task.  Clearly test cases are needed, but they
don't address the issue of how to document a complex algorithm being
reworked into complex code in general.  Proving the correctness of the
translation is beyond the scope of literate programming, and probably
beyond the ability of any software in existance right now.  There are
techniques like the B method to prove that what the code gives you is
what you designed, and help you create a design that does precisely
what you want, but I rather doubt such tools are practical for this
level of mathematical work.

What the test suites do is prove that the program is function as it
should in the environment and that changes to other parts of the
codebase haven't caused changes, not that the mathematics are correct. 
In a test suite, you must tell the program what the answer is and then
the program attempts to reach the answer.  The variables are whether
the algorithm is correct, whether a change elsewhere breaks the code in
question, and whether the supporting OS/environment is functioning
correctly.  But the first case is not specific to a test suite - it is
used when writing the algorithm and/or debugging it for math errors.
The  second case is useful when checking a bugfix or change hasn't
caused larger changes, but again does not ensure that the mathematics
are correct.  The third use is strictly for installation.

Ouch.  What I ment though was when you said there were 1100 domains in
Axiom with no theoretical documentation - is that what the paper
conversion is addressing?

I've been collecting test cases from different computer algebra systems.
The effort is called CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite). 

One of the problems with current systems, like Axiom, is that people
write some algebra then write some test cases. The test cases are not
comprehensive, don't test corner cases, and don't test failure modes.
And, most egregious is, they are not documented. The tests given 
an answer but is it the right answer? So current test cases are only
really useful as regression tests looking for what's broken.

So the idea is to collect the various test suites, document the 
underlying math and set up pamphlet files which contain code for
each of the various systems. You can get the Axiom code pile with
the CATS work using the tla from Gnu-arch.

The idea is to develop a test suite that would be similar to the 
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) classification
scheme for numerical software but this time for symbolic software.
Currently there is no classification scheme and no agreed-upon
test suite.

There are few enough computational mathematicians. We shouldn't waste
their time duplicating tests in areas that others have already done.
Besides, tests are best when written by others :-)

Thus, CATS.

Sigh, guess i'm gonna have to learn tcl.
I'll look at xmaxima and see what it might require.

I'm looking at what kind of tools there might be to do a notebook.

It's mostly research to see what tools are available to do a GUI
in front of Axiom. I'm at the point of collecting ideas to see
what comes to mind. If we're going to do a new "notebook" we 
might as well design the next generation of notebooks (though
the term is somewhat limiting).

The pamphlet is intended to reference other pamphlets thru the
bibliogrphy. Pamphlets are intended to stay very close to the
what scientists know and extending it carefully. The next step
is to introduce semantic latex tags like \concept{ }

Yes. Magnus represents a competely new challenge because it contains
almost no algorithms. Almost everything is a procedure and may not 
terminate. You kick off several algorithms in parallel and let them
compete for a solution. Infinite Group Theory is provably non-algorithmic
for almost every question.

erm,... I retype the papers from pdf format to TeX format and then
include the code (making it a pamphlet). Almost no-one posts TeX
so there appears to be no choice. Fateman has been looking at
recognizers for file formats but a push to collect and store the TeX
files would save a tremendous amount of time. In the last year I've
retyped approx 500 pages of pdf to TeX.

ummm, pamphlets contain the algorithms. If they reference other 
algorithms it would be thru the bibliograpy. I have a bibtex file
for the current Axiom pamphlets but have not yet incorporated it
into the released build.

The comment about "staying close to what scientists know" is a 
reference to the fact that most papers today use TeX. The noweb
technology by Norman Ramsey make some very simple extensions to
the TeX markup to support literate programs. So a pamphlet without
code is essentially a TeX document. Adding code requires learning
two new markup tags and two commands and now you can extract the
code (the notangle command) and extract the paper (the noweave command).

The comment about \concept{} is a reference to the fact that TeX
is a syntactic markup. I want to extend TeX with semantic markup
tags. These would not affect the print format of a paper. However
they would tag "concepts" that would be pushed into a semantic
network (ref: KROPS, my pre-axiom area of research). This would
allow us to search papers for ideas rather than strings.

Yes. I have permission to use several phd thesis papers and several
research papers but some of them were either professionally typeset
or done in other markup languages (such as IBM script) so there is no 
TeX available. I'm hand-typing them back into TeX and combining them
with the domains they document. See dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet which is
from Richard Paul's PhD thesis in robotics and documents 
Denavit-Hartenberg Matrices, a special kind of homogeneous
transformation matrix implemented in Axiom. I really wish authors
would adopt the open source model and publish the raw TeX documents.

BF,

I downloaded your documents PDF and the Maple code.
I did succeed in setting up the libraries.
I tried to run the Maple code with little success.
I'll try again soon.

I was hoping that the docs contained a description of the algorithms
but all I've seen so far is a description of the functions and their
calling arguments.

This is the path followed by the FOC project
(http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/foc/index-en.html). The objective is to make
a provable CAS. They are using free software for that (the OCaml
language and the Coq proof assistant) but unfortunalty, they have chosen
to make the system closed source and proprietary[1].

On the Axiom side, there is a path that can be followed: using ACL2
(http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/) to make a similar
system. Both Axiom and ACL2 (and Maxima) run on GCL. But all the hard
work (i.e. proving things) remain to be done.

Interesting idea: systematizing the idea of reference
implementation. And formal proofs between the different implementations
are not necessary. We just need a framework to easily redo a fast
computation with a slower but safer implementation. Of course, formal
proof would be a plus, but I doubt that it can be done.


[1] I wonder when one french reasearcher will understand the power and
    necessity of free software for real research!

The developer list is where most discussion occurs.

The archives are at:

Thanks for permission to use your paper. The plan is to rework it
into a literate programming format which means to modify the TeX
to include actual source code. Is there any chance of getting the
original TeX (assuming you used that). I'm working on model examples
of literate programs in Axiom and selecting interesting papers that
include features like pseudocode, complexity analysis, algorithm
theory, termination proofs, etc. Ideally all computational math
papers would include runnable source code.

Vladimir,

There is code in Axiom to perform regression tests every time the
system is changed. 

You're welcome to download the package and create a new testing
scheme if you'd like. The CVS is at:

http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom

and you can send patches directly to me. 

How do you suggest we change the testing scheme?

Tim

===============================================================

Hello Timothy,

You are the leader of the Axiom project; do you think it would
be interesting to identify bugs in Axiom automatically?

Actually, I am in software testing 10+ years, particularly, I have
tested MMA, Maple, Derive, MuPAD, and more, details are here
http://www.cas-testing.org/index.php?list=3

I know your site and visited it a number of times. I have a limited
live experience with Axiom but I had read the J/S book many times.
Sure, I also have seen Axiom bug list. I work on automated testing
of computer algebra systems; now I have shown publicly a couple of
first steps like http://maple.bug-list.org/ but I have gotten
essentially farther, and most probably within several next months
I will update cardinally my servers wrt Maple.

I find Axiom to be a terrific environment and have real interest
in testing it. Thought I did not test Axiom still, from the previous
experience with MMA/Maple I can expect that my GEMM environment
can calculate solid "minimal" bug lists, its records will contain
the "minimal" (say, in length) samples at which the given bug
manifests.

What do you make of it?

Best wishes,

Vladimir

That would be great!  I don't know anything at all about Axiom, so I
have no clue about how that would work....

Maxima is not a clean system.  A lot of state is held in global
variables or communicated via global variables.  Errors aren't always
clean.  Etc.  So it is not easy to make it "play well with others".  But
there are certainly clean parts, and other parts might be encapsulable.

Subject: maxima and axiom

Maxima and Axiom can work together usefully. One interesting idea
is that since maxima is common lisp and axiom is also common lisp
we could run them both in the same image. In axiom you can execute
lisp commands with
  )lisp (yourlispfn args)

Suppose we load maxima into an axiom image. We could then type:

  )lisp (maxima)

and be in maxima. Why bother? Well, if we could get the two systems
to talk it might be useful to use one system to check the results of
the other system automatically. And since Axiom is really just lisp
then Maxima could use Axiom code and vice-versa. It would take some
engineering but that's just the easy part :-)

Camm,

Axiom "knows" where certain files reside so you may need symbolic
links to get it to run. I am working hard on putting together the
ISSAC proceedings on CD and can't look at the debian package now.
Next week I have to go give two invited lectures and will likely not
have connectivity (it's still the late 80s in most of the world it
seems). So I'm not going to be able to look critically at the changes
you've made to the axiom distribution until after next week.

We should rewrite the Makefiles to build in your new "install"
scheme. Can you give me a simple outline of what you moved where?
I'll rewrite the Makefile install so it all works properly and
you don't have to change anything for debian. But it can't happen
in the next two weeks. If you can get the move list to me by 
monday I can probably work on the changes offline in the hotel.

Axiom does not yet run on Windows. The port is "in plan" but has

we get the open source lab up and running which won't be for

erm...ok. it's open source. find a bug. report it. send a patch
that fixes it and I'll incorporate it. if not, I'll fix it as
soon as I can. Most bugs don't get posted because I'm the one
who knows what the bug is and I fix them as I find them. The 
most active developers usually send me mail directly rather than
use the bug list.

Are you suggesting that the length of a bug list is in some
way related to the quality of software? I'd welcome any testing
you're willing to do on Axiom. It certainly needs more testing
and there are certainly more bugs. But the code has been around
for 30 years so it doesn't have the typical "startup" bug profile.

See the archives for this mailing list related to the CATS 
(Computer Algebra Test Suite) effort.

I would not discard the possibility the best most concrete descriptions
of algorithms that you will find will be the programs (e.g.
Mathematica code), and that the reduction of the papers to
the code may involve details not present in the papers.

This opinion is, however, based on general experience and not
a particular examination of FeynCalc.

Good luck in any case..

Greetings!  Just a thought here -- luckily all this is on top of lisp,
and, in principle, its 'code is data' feature would allow one to write
a walker which would generate a list of invocations guaranteed to
trigger every branch, or even specified levels of branch
combinations.  Someone told me once they've seen such a walker for a
certain application, so the idea is not completely vaporware, but I'd
imagine the test list would grow exponentially quite quickly.

Just a thought.

Greetings!  Just my 0.02 here --

I think the concept of literate programming axiom has adopted is
marvelous.  The need for providing a ladder whereby a human brain can
easily expand the realm of its comprehension into a new area of
interest without expensive infrastructure and in a reasonable period
of time exceeds the need for a black box to spit out an answer in
assembly line fashion, IMHO, though both needs obviously exist and
will continue to do so.  As long as we're talking 30 years, I think
the real coup would be to provide a framework which smooths the path
stretching from one end of this continuum to the other, and
concommitantly, provides utility and access to as wide a group of
interested volunteers as possible, especially in this frenetic age
when one's available time is likely to come in erratic and
unpredicatable short bursts.

Take care,

Toward this end, it would be helpful to clearly and as concisely as

implemented.  I'm assuming this exists in the documentation, but as

Maybe a good way to say it is thus:

An algorithm implemented in a program allows no implicit assumptions.

In a case where there are issues with translating an algorithm to
program level, the questions that come to my mind are:

1)  Do the implicit assumptions initially made, when made explicit, map
well to the programming environment?

2)  Has the space in which the algorithm is known/intended to operate
been well defined?

3)  Are the assumptions in fact well understood?

In theory at least, computers ought to be capable of verifying that
human created mathematics is correct.  (Somebody correct me if that
isn't true.) Perhaps part of the problem is that a human being faced
with a physical/science problem can make "sane" assumptions where a
computer cannot, or see that a result makes no physical sense and thus
conclude there is a mistake.  Making sure the system has enough
information to do the job is often a difficult propositon.

Perhaps a trend toward literate programming such as that being used in
Axiom might be generally better practice for defining algorithms, but I
suspect the extra work involved will limit the appeal to many. 
Probably if an idea is reduced to working symbolic computational
algorithms it will be by someone who focuses on that.

Let me say that this *must* be implemented by an expert.  The physics
community barely trusts such codes, and the ones that are barely trusted
(such as ff) have been massively cross checked across many calculations
and papers.  That said:

Bertfried Fauser (on CC list) works on these types of things and might
be an appropriate person to do it.

These calculations are in general plauged by singularities, and the
procedure to remove them lies in physics, not math (renormalization).
The singularities are real, but we understand that they do not affect
physical observables.  If it were possible to write general algorithmic
codes, we would do it.

Greetings!  OK, please tell me if the following is not clear.  Debian
can build packages using 'install' and 'links' files.  The former
consists of lines of two fields each: the file location in the build
tree and its destination directory when the corresponding package is
installed.  The latter (i.e. 'links files) also consist of lines of
two fields each: the installed file location and the destination
location of the link.  Lastly, Debian has a 'control' file which
describes the packages and their interrelationships.

I've included what I have so far below.  Please note that it is still
a work in progress for sure -- comments most appreciated.  For
example, Debian has nowebm already packaged, so I've omitted these
files and had the package suggest nowebm.  I'm assuming that is
sufficient, but it would also be possible of course to require nowebm
and install links as appropriate.  I'd also appreciate recommendations
on the wording of the package descriptions, as these were obviously
just put together quickly.  There are other debian specific files,
such as menu entries, TeX style file installation scripts, etc.  These
can be examined by unpacking the .debs directly, a task with which I
will be happy to assist should you desire.

Lastly, I'm experimenting a bit with the build procedure.  I've tried
instructing the build to run twice after touching the .lisp and .lsp
files, as you've earlier mentioned and we've discussed, for a dramatic
performance improvement.  I'm trying now to achieve the same result
with a single compile pass (debian has some very slow platforms),
using a 'sys-proclaim.lisp' file automatically generated from the .fn
files via (for example)

echo ')lisp (compiler::make-all-proclaims "int/interp/*.fn"
"int/algebra/*.fn")' | obj/linux/bin/interpsys

and adding this to the PROCLAIMS make variable in
src/interm/Makefile.pamphlet to be loaded into depsys.  Depending on
how you load your .fn files (haven't yet checked), this could be
faster as well -- all this compiler generated info should be loaded
into the image before compiling any of the final .o files (i.e. not
just the .fn file pertaining to the file being compiled.)  I think
axiom likely already does this.

Take care,

Subject: axiom update
Cc: Andrei Sokolov

The latest changes have been pushed into the savannah CVS today.

There are two major changes related to ongoing efforts.

First, the pamphlet files are starting to show up as dvi
files under the mnt/sys/doc subdirectory. These are in
preparation for developing a viewer of some sort.

Second, a new, nonfunctional )set command exists:

   )set output openmath on

which does nothing at the moment but is related to ongoing
joint work with the ORRCA group at Univ. Western Ontario.
The eventual plan is to enable I/O using OpenMath.

One side-effect is that src/interp/setvars.boot and setvart.boot
have better organization and documentation.

If I set you up with a userid/passwd on axiom-developer.org
would you be interested in setting up/maintaining the arch

besides setting it up we need to figure out how to make it
writeable directly from the net so people can push changes
back directly without going thru me. i'm too much of a

Yes, I can help, but not before the middle of June.

I'm a bit reluctant to offer write access to anybody (including
myself). I think peer review of patches is of first importance for
software quality. I personnaly think that having a core team of
developers integrating patch from others is better.

Subject: Patches (?) for sum/product and sqrt

last weekend I tracked down two of the bugs I reported. However, the way to fix
one of them is not completely clear to me. (The other one I submitted as a
patch) Therefore, I'd like to discuss it here first...

[bugs #9057] product over product or sum fail

The problem is that

(2) -> product(summation(i,i=1..j),j=1..1)
 
   >> Error detected within library code:
   not a kernel

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

or, even shorter,

(2) -> eval(summation(i,i=1..%A),%A,1)
 
   >> Error detected within library code:
   not a kernel

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

in fact, anything but %A works in the line above. Obviously, this is a problem
of variable capture. Internally, summation(f(i),i=1..j) is represented as the
operator %defsum with arguments [f(%A),%A,i,1,j]. For some reason, the
author of the package introduces a dummy variable %A, which represents the
summation index. Since the same dammy variable is used for all sums and
products, there is a problem when we nest them or when the summation bound is
"bad". The offending line product(summation(i,i=1..j),j=1..1) is represented as

%defprod with arguments [%defsum with arguments [%A,%A,i,1,%A],%A,j,1,1]

and, when evaluating it, axiom substitutes 1 for %A in the inner list. Then it
tries to evaluate %defum with arguments [1,1,i,1,1] which leads to an error,
because AXIOM expects the second element of the list to be a symbol...

A possible fix is to introduce a new dummy variable for each sum and
product. However, I did not *quite* manage to do so, since AXIOM does not seem
to care about which symbols are already around:

(1) -> %A::SYMBOL

   (1)  %A
                                                                 Type: Symbol
(2) -> new()$SYMBOL

   (2)  %A
                                                                 Type: Symbol
(3) -> G1419::SYMBOL

   (3)  G1419
                                                                 Type: Symbol
(4) -> symbol(GENSYM()$Lisp)

   (4)  G1419
                                                                 Type: Symbol

Anyway, in the submitted patchfile, I did this.

In fact, I do not really understand why this dummy variable is needed...

While reading the package COMBF I stumbled over annother bug. The following is
used as rule for differentiating sums:

    dvdsum(l, x) ==
      x = retract(y := third l)@SE => 0
      k := retract(d := second l)@K
      differentiate(h := third rest rest l,x) * eval(f := first l, k, h)
        - differentiate(g := third rest l, x) * eval(f, k, g)
             + opdsum [differentiate(f, x), d, y, g, h]

Although this -- d/dx sum_i^x f(i) = f(x) -- is a nice try, it is wrong. It
seems that the order of magnitude is roughly correct, but that's about it.

Bill,

I'm starting to use your wiki. It's an experiment in "learning in public"
about Clifford algebras. I have no idea how it will turn out but it is
at least an attempt to leverage the wiki for documentation purposes.
The new page is at:

Hi Tim,

I am just back from another trip, hence my silence in recent weeks.

Thank you for pointing out your new Clifford algebra page on the
axiom-developer wiki. I have added a comment to the page with what
I think are some useful references, a small criticism concerning
Lie algebra versus Clifford algebra and a few other opinions.
I think your goal of a more advanced implementation of Clifford
algebra in Axiom is a very good one. And I hope other people will
also contribute when they have time.

BTW, when I set up Plone at axiom-developer.org a few weeks ago,
I remember configuring the system to enable email subscriptions.
I.e. the system should allow people to subscribe to topics and
to pages that interest them and then automatically send email
updates when new material is added to the web site. I am sure
that this used to work when I first tested it but it does not
seem to be working now. Has something changed in the configuration
of the axiom-developer system? Specifically, is the sendmail
process still running and does it enable email to be forwarded?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Hi Tim,

Email from the Axiom portal (and wiki) at
axiom-developer.org still does not seem to be working.
I have made several tests and even restarted the Zope
server program but so far I have not received any email
from the system. But I do not get any error message either.

I am not sure what might be wrong.

When you are logged in remoted to the
axiom-developer.org system can you send outgoing
email? I suppose I can also try this from here
via ssh. Perhaps it will show some kind of error.

Later,
Bill Page.

Tim,

Oops, I did not look closely enough. When I try to
send an email message containg a link to some page
on the portal (using the little email icon at the
top right corner of the page), I get the following
error message:

  (111, 'Connection refused')

Perhaps that indicates that sendmail is still not
configured the way that it was originally, about
4 weeks ago.
