I tried the simple tail recursion code by Bill, and repeat after )clear all,
with slight variations. Here are two transcripts. I also verify that if one
starts a FRESH session of Axiom, f and g behave symmetrically when lines (5) of
the FIRST trial are switched from f to g. Comments added in transcripts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) -> )set mess autoload off
(1) -> )set functions compile on

Comments: Trial A:

(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> g:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> f(1)
   Compiling function g with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> f(1)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;f;1;initial| is undefined.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(5) -> g(1)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;f;1;initial| is undefined.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Comments on Trial A: same as Bill's. Now Trial B.

(5) -> )clear all
   All user variables and function definitions have been cleared.
(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> g:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> g(1)
   Compiling function f with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> f(2)

   >> System error:
   Invocation history stack overflow.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(5) -> f(1)

   >> System error:
   Invocation history stack overflow.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Comments on Trial B: why does f(2) make a difference? If the stack overflowed,
should it be cleared? If yes, computational result may be lost? Does an
overflowed stack still have any usefulness? If not (as it seems), will forcing a
user to exit Axiom cause loss of data (including previously computed results in
the same session if the user did not )spool? 
Now Trial C.

(5) -> )clear all
   All user variables and function definitions have been cleared.
(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> g:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> g(1)
   Compiling function f with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> g(1)

   >> System error:
   Invocation history stack overflow.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Comments on Trial C: why does g(1) make a difference? Could this be because
")clear all" does not clear all (such as the Invocation history stack? It does
not clear input history: is that the same?)

Comments: Trial D, same as Trial A.

(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void

(5) -> f(1)
   Compiling function g with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> f(1)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;f;1;initial| is undefined.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Comments on Trial D: none. Now Trial E.

(5) -> )clear all
   All user variables and function definitions have been cleared.
(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void

(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> f(1)
   Compiling function g with type Integer -> Integer

Comments on Trial E: The next )clear all was accidental. Now Trial F.

(5) -> )clear all
   All user variables and function definitions have been cleared.
(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> g:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> f(1)
   Compiling function g with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> f(1)

   >> System error:

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(5) -> g(2)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;f;1;initial| is undefined.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Comments on Trial F: Why doesn't "Invocation Stack Overflow" occur in g(2)? as
in Trial B of Transcript 1? How was the symmetry in f and g broken? Does the
accident Trial E has anything to do with this?  Now Trial G, which repeats Trial
F.

(5) -> )clear all
   All user variables and function definitions have been cleared.
(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> g:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> f(1)
   Compiling function g with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> g(2)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;f;1;initial| is undefined.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Comments on Trial G, a repeat of Trial F, no surprise. Now Trial H.

(5) -> )clear all
   All user variables and function definitions have been cleared.
(1) -> f:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> g:INT->INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(3) -> f(n)==g(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(4) -> g(n)==f(n)
                                                                   Type: Void
(5) -> g(1)
   Compiling function f with type Integer -> Integer
(5) -> f(2)

   >> System error:
   Invocation history stack overflow.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(5) ->

Comments on Trial H: This is the same as Trial F except in (5) g and f are
switched. symmetry broken again?

Final comments: Axiom should be consistent after a ")clear all", and f and g
should behave symmetrically. Moreover, using f(1) or f(2) should make no
difference to the error messages in the above code. And, of course, the first
call in (5) should already return an error message, as Bill noted already.

Least anyone think I have abandoned this, I just want to give a brief update:

I've started trying to create a units.spad.pamphlet file, but as yet I've not 
written any actual code - I'm trying to set up the structure of the latex 
document itself and provide a useful background on units, dimensions, and 
issues surrounding them.  This is not strictly speaking useful to the Axiom 
implementation part of this discussion, but has proven very educational for 
me about units, measurement, and standards :-).  I figure this is the moral
equalevent of documenting algorithms and domains in normal Axiom usage,
so I'll try to cram in all the potentially important information.  I suspect 
what I'll wind up with might be overkill, but it can always be trimmed down.

I'm trying to lay things out overall along the lines which have evolved from
the previous discussions, but those discussions printed out are well over 60 
pages so it's a lot to go through.  I'm going to add a couple sections to the 
document that initially won't see much (if any) work, as they are parts 
William disliked (ways to make units populate the top level namespace, 
Reverse Dimensional Analysis, user level tools for a MyUnits environment, 
etc.) and aren't necessary to the core functionality in any case.  Right now, 
I'm just trying to define terms, document the reasoning behind design 
decisions, find and cite useful and important sources like the NIST 
definition documents, and generally get set up so the nitty gritty 
implementation details have a framework to go in.  My first cut  will 
probably not be very good, but at least it will be something to tear apart 
and redo.  Once I've reached a stage where it might be of interest to someone 
I'll be glad to post it.  I may throw in a little code attempting to do 
something like define the top level Category, but it will almost certainly be 
completely wrong the first time around ;-).

Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know I hadn't lost interest.  (Real life 
can get rather annoying at times, too - jobs sure can eat up time :-/.)  

Thought we'd get more comment (other than from me anyway) on William's overall 
design ideas - maybe we got too longwinded and lost the audience? ;-)  

Cheers,
CY

Dear Bill, *,

I just noticed that you augmented the aldor environment on MathAction to allow
for an optional argument, specifying some library.

Although I do not exactly know the background, I think that this is not a good
idea. I'm quite certain we should reserve the optional argument to allow for
specifying the version/patch number of the CAS in question, in line with my
feature request 

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/44IssueTrackerNeedsToBeAbleToUseOldAxiomVersions

Is there maybe a different possibility to achieve the same goal? Furthermore it
seems to me that the name specified should also be visible on the rendered
MathAction page, which is not the case, currently.

I hope that there is a solution which does not make it more difficult to
specify versions later on. (If this is not the case anyway, please ignore this
email)

Martin

Dear Axiom enthusiasts and category theorists:

Having spent a few days trying to absorb the Aldor programming
philosophy from the point of view of it's evolution from previous
incarnations of the Axiom library compiler, as described here:

http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap18.html

I find there is one construct in particular in Aldor that really
stands out in my mind - it's the concept of representation and
it's opposite (abstraction?). In Aldor these are formally denoted
by two very peculiar coercion operations: rep and pre.

In older SPAD terms, rep and per can be written as the following
macros:

macro {
        rep x =3D=3D x @ % pretend Rep;
        per r =3D=3D r @ Rep pretend %;
)

The expression rep(x) describes an object x of this domain but
treats it as belonging to a different domain Rep.

The expression per(y) describes an object y from the Rep domain
which is to be treated as belonging to this domain.

In looking through older SPAD code it is clear that these
combinations occur frequently and their encapsulation as rep
and pre makes reading Aldor code much easier than SPAD.

My question is: does anyone know of any formal programming
language research papers that describe the semantics of rep
and per in a general way?

If this sort of mechanism is present in other languages, what
form does it take?

It seems to me that rep and pre constitute the essence of the
peculiar object-oriented programming style pioneered by Axiom
and Aldor. But what are these constructs in formal (categorical)
terms?

Below are my first attempts to answer these questions. Your
comments, corrections and opinions would be most welcome.

--------

It seems appropriate to me to think of rep and per as forming
a pair of adjoint functors:

             rep
            ---->
   % domain       Rep domain
            <----
             per

rep is a "forgetful functor" that maps the abstract structure
(objects and operations) of this domain into it's internal
representation. It "forgets" about the abstract relationships.
The objects of the external domain however are viewed only in
terms of the relationships between objects. The image of this
domain under rep in representation has its internal structure
exposed.

per on the other hand constructs abstract members of this
domain from the underlying representation. It encapsulates
the internal operations of the representation in terms of
the abstract structure of this domain.

domains must be thought of in terms of categories both in the
sense of category theory and in Axiom's sense of "category".
The appropriate categories usually have at least the structure
of a Cartesian closed category which they inherit from
Axiom's basic types constructors, record, union and mapping.
See discussion:
http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/TuplesProductsAndRecords

In terms of category theory there is a natural transformation,
called the 'unit', that partitions elements of the Rep domain
into classes (as an abstract quotient of the representation).

  x --> rep(per(x))

and rep is right adjoint of per.

In category theoretic terms Rep domain is some Cartesian closed
category, i.e. consisting of products (records), co-products
(unions) and exponentials (functions) over some basic set
of component domains. It's operations are formed freely from
the operations of it's components.

The implementation of the domain in terms of the representation
establishes a natural bi-jection between the operation of the
external domain and the operation of it's internal representation.

   x -> rep y    (representation)
  ------------
   per x -> y    (domain)

The book: "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists", by
Benjamin Pierce, MIT Press, 1991, is a good reference. See
especially section 2.4. Pierce gives an excellent example in
terms of definition of the 'List' constructor.

Also: "Categories, Types and Structures. An introduction to Category
Theory for the working computer scientist." by Andrea Asperti and
Giuseppe Longo, M.I.T. Press, 1991, which is downloadable from here:

Bill Page.

The reason I did this (only for \begin{aldor}[name] ... so far)
is because of the way that the Aldor compiler works.

In the case of SPAD a call to the compiler

)compile xxxx.spad

produces lisp and object code in a location /NRLIB.NAME/...
determined by the

)abbrev NAME LongName

command inside the xxxxx.spad file and does not depend on
the file name. And on a later page you can write

)lib NAME

and the appropriate object module gets loaded.

In the case of Aldor a call to the compiler

)compile xxxx.as

produces lisp and object code in the locations xxxx.lsp and
xxxx.asy determined by the name of the xxxx.as file. Now in
a later page you need to write

)lib xxxx

When MathAction collections Axiom, SPAD and Aldor sections
for execution, it prepares a series of files - one for each
environment section. Until introducing Aldor, the names of
these files did not matter and they were just generated
randomly by the system. But because the name matters to
Aldor, it is very awkward to have to refer to an Aldor-
compiled object file later based on some randomly generated
largely numerical name.

As I explained earlier, because of the design of MathAction
it would be quite awkward to mix different versions of the
same external program on the same page. MathAction would
have to make a separate pass over the contents of the page
for each version of each external program. I think that
could soon become to prohibitive in terms of the time required
to parse and save a page.

A better idea, I think, would perhaps be to introduce a
paramter associated with the whole page - similar to the
way the pagetype is specified now.

I am really not convinced however how useful running
multiple version of Axiom on MathAction would be. If we
want to "freeze" the output to be that generated by a
certain version of Axiom for later reference, then we
could always just keep the static HTML that was generated
by that version but cut-and-paste.

The name is visible inside the compiler output section.
Click on the '+ aldor' link to expand it.

I don't think that this is that case, but I would never
just ignore your email. :)

CY

EXCELLENT!!!

It's good to see someone taking the time and energy to document the
background and primary information about the how and why of category
and domain instruction. My hope is that this will be the way Axiom
is developed in the future. The code can always be improved but the
design decisions are vital. I'm trying to document existing code and
the questions ALWAYS arise: "WHY is this code here?", "WHAT were they
trying to do?", "WHERE is this code used?", etc. The questions arise
even in code *I* wrote years ago.

Coding is the easy part once you understand the issues. It is the
understanding that takes a long time. I believe that writing down
what you come to understand is what will make Axiom into a living
system (in the Christopher Alexander sense). Write for the next
generation who will have to maintain it and change it.

Dear C Y:

This long-winded email started more than a week ago and school started got in
the way. In addition, computer problems, mainly: network and
crashing OS without saving :-( , but also some hardware ones. 

I am glad to know that you are working on this project. I meant to form the
ideas below more thoroughly before posting them but I see you have already
started real work. So I hope these new suggestions, incomplete as they may be,
perhaps should be made known to you and we can discuss this and if I got time to
revise them (probably during labor day weekend), I'll do so. 

It seems that a thorough study of dimensions and units in relation to symbolic
computations is not available and your work/paper would be very useful.

I have added comments on the draft below using [comments: ...].

William
--

I think we are in general agreement regarding how to implement the UnitSystem
domains. Your provoking questions led me to propose modifications to the
original scheme (and even that, is far from a final design as I have been
changing them constantly as I write). The new scheme hopefully will solve some
of the design problems we discussed. I hope before long the new proposal will
approach a practical one. After waiting a short period of further discussions, a
summary of the final design should be posted at MathAction for others to comment
on.

I actually prefer your use of ")set UnitSystem ..." to ")set unit
...". But note ")set UnitSystem" IS setting the session default for the
user. Axiom allows a user to set his preferences in a file called axiom.input
(which is in the directory $AXIOM/input). So by putting ")set UnitSystem
MYUnitSystem" in that file, Axiom will use MYUNitSystem as the default unit
system when the functions 'unitMass' etc (to be grouped into a new function
'setDim', see below) are called.  MYUnitSystem can be SI, CGS,
or some modified version of the standard SI (but once modified, it should be
called something else). Of course, this needs some code or setup to modify the
interpreter, but it can be done (Tim Daly or Bill Page would no doubt know how
and can assist you when that time comes). Most likely, it is a matter of adding
one or two lines to a database.

As for tools to do the dynamic modification from standard unit systems like SI,
here are several changes to the previous setup that will facilitate this and
improve the organization of the domains as well. 

[Comments: I have not decided whether there should be more than one category,
and also what to call them. Also there is a difficulty with dimensions(),
units() because they do not return a domain, to be used in the signatures. So
you may safely ignored the next paragraph for now. However, what I had in mind
was to allow many domains like Dimension = Union("Mass", etc) and corresponding
Unit = Union("slug", etc) for people (students ?) who don't need the full set,
as well as the ability to add new supersets later. Unfortunately, we cannot
have:

  Dimension(dims:List String) == Union(dims)

]

FIRST (alternative): On the category level: 

There will be 

(I) a UnitConversion category, whose details I have not investigated, but its
domains will contain tables for all dimensions for a particular expert field,
units, and conversion factors from SI. There will probably be one comprehensive
such domain to start the ball rolling, but we will surely miss some dimensions
and units in some not-so-common expert areas or new areas. The category will
provide guidelines to add these new areas.

UnitSystem(S, D, U):Category == Exports where
   S: SetCategory
   D: List String
   U: List String

   dimensions: ()->List String
   units: ()->List String
   convertFactor: String -> Float

For example, dimensions() = ["Mass", "Length", ...] (which replaces Dimension =
Union("Mass", "Length", ...), making this local to a unit system rather than one
global list.

(II) ??? Dimension(dims:List String) == Union(dims)


[Comments: The ideas from now on are more or less well formed. However, I have
not finished rearranging these in a more logical sequence. So read it a few
times! I might have made some obsolete claims as I reorganized my thoughts
without revising the claims.]

FIRST: Consolidate all the unitXXX and setUnitXXX functions to::

UnitSystemCategory(S: SetCategory):Category == Exports where

  Dimension ==> Union("Mass", "Length", ...)
  Unit ==> Union("kg", "m", ...)
  Join(RetractableTo S,...) with 
   
    setDimUnit: (Dimension, Unit, S) -> %
    setUnit: (Dimension, Unit) -> Null (?)
    setUnitAll: (Dimension, Unit) -> Null (?)

where 'setDimUnit(dim, unit, s)' is a LOCAL command affecting ONLY s:S, and
'setUnit(dim, unit)' would be a GLOBAL command affecting ALL s:S (more on this
later).  Null may be replaced with a new state vector?

Note that the way Dimension and Unit are defined (as Union("Mass", "Length",
...) and Union("slug", "ft", ...)) is very close to making each dimension and
unit a domain of its own, except that here each domain consists of just its name
(string). You may also consult the way BasicOperators and CommonOperators are
designed, but at least for the moment, the simpler setup probably suffices.

SECOND: To support the implementation for 'setUnit' (a dynamical change of
units), I propose to add a state vector for each unit system domain: this state
vector stores the current unit for each dimension, which is updated by the
'setUnit' command. The 'setDimUnit' command can check this state vector before
generating the Rep (see below). Some care has to be considered: we have to
decide whether a 'setUnit(dim, unit)' command should affect the other derived
units that depends on 'dim' or not, and also those the variables whose
dimensions were set before this 'setUnit' command and invole 'dim'. I have added
'setUnitAll' for the case every current variable will be updated.


Thus, we can replace unitLength(len) by setDim("Length", len) when the default
unit is used, where::

    setDim(dim: Dimension, s:S):% == setDimUnit: (dim, unit(dim), s)

and 'unit(dim)' is a look-up function using the state-vector of the present unit
system.


SECOND: Extend the Rep in these domains to include units and conversion factors.
 
   Rep:=Record(value:S, dim:Dimension, unit:Unit, factor:(Float, String), 
               absfactor:(Float, String))

My original proposed Rep is simpler because I was not planning for dynamic
changes to the unit system, so unit and factor (which would be 1 always) are
"hard-wired". The more general record allows more flexibility. This is slightly
less efficient in terms of storage, but not that bad, because no matter what,
somewhere, the system has to store the conversion factors. The conversion
factors can probably be implemented in a UnitConversion domain, which would be a
lookup table (maybe tables), which drives the 'setDimUnit' and 'setUnit'
commands. Axiom has a number of data structures with extensive tools to create
lookup tables (see domains of category TableAggregate in table.spad).

In the new Rep, besides the unit, two factors are included: One relative to the
current system (to provide a relative factor to convert within this system when
a user changes a unit, and one relative to SI (to provide an absolute factor to
convert between systems: for SI derived unit system, just one factor would
suffice; but we should aim for uniformity to simplify the code). Each factor has
both a value (Float) and a name (String). The value of the factor is when
numerical output is needed, that is, when S is coerced to Float (via the "lift"
mechanism). The name would be used in output for symbolic computations to
indicate a conversion factor is needed, without spoiling the elegance of
symbolic computation or more importantly, going outside the domain S. It is only
a decoration in the output (so it can be used with even Float alone), but it
serves two important roles as well: it can be used as an index key to the
UnitConversion table(s) to look up the value of the factor, and it can also be
used to provide an audit trail in numerical computations: typically, if the
answer is simply in numeric form set to the user's unit, the user may not have
any idea of how what factors are used in its computation; by delaying the use of
numerical values for conversion factors, the user can track each conversion in
symbolic form for numerical inputs to verify correctness and then compute when
everything is ok (in case there are bugs, for example, this can be used for
debugging too).   

The above setup would make the coercion to OutputForm quite straight forward and
uniform (which should ignore the factors if they are (1.0, "1")).




The following scenario will illustrate the potential problems and I'll put in
some suggestions on how to solve some of these.

Assuming the above extended Rep:  unit is initialialised to the standard one for
the system, factor initialized to (1.0, "1"), absfactor initialized to
(absfactorvalue, absfactorname).  Let's assume the default unit system
is FPS (foot-pound-second, a non-scientific system still used in the US), see:

http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/foot-pound-second+system

When a user runs the command:

(1)   ulen: := setDim("Length", len)

Axiom will return:

      len [ft]

but internally, the Rep is

    [value = len, dim = "Length", unit = "ft", factor = (1.0,"1"),
     absfactor = (0.3048, "ft2m")]

Here the absfactor says 1 ft is 0.3048 m. The name can be constructed
dynamically using string concatenation using the UnitConversion table.

(By the way, you can find lots of conversion factors on line: for example
 http://www.onlineconversion.com/
Just learn a bit more! Let's just stay with English for this discussion.)

In a STATIC change environment (this is, at compile time), if the user prefers
"in" GLOBALLY as the unit for length, the command 

(2) setUnit("Length", "in") 

Here is a design question: we can let setUnit("Length", "in") to modify ONLY the
unit of the "Length" dimension and not any derived dimension that involves
"Length". This would be the most flexible so that we can allow
will change the state-vector to reflect all units that involve a "Length"
dimension as component

len ft2in [in]

with the internal Rep now:

   [value = len, dim = "Length", unit = "in", factor = (12, "ft2in"), 
    absfactor = (0.0254, "in2m")]

where 0.0254 can be computed from 0.3048 by dividing by 12, some other means.
The absfactor will faciliate converting FPS to SI, and hence to other system as
well.


If the user prefers "cm" as the unit for length in an otherwise FPS system, the
command unitLength can be modified to produce:

(3)   len ft2cm [cm]

with the internal Rep now:

   [value = len, dim = "Length", unit = "cm", factor = (30.48, "ft2cm"),
    absfactor = (0.01, "cm2m")]

This is all not difficult for STATIC changes, that is, changes that are effected
at Axiom start time. Now consider DYNAMIC changes: suppose again the default is
FPS system, and the user has already set the variable ulen as in (1).

Now if the user later runs:
  
(4)    setUnitLength("cm")

What does this involve? You are now in a run-time environment, you cannot change
the code for unitLength in the FPS domain, you can only change data. (Code
modification is in theory possible if you know enough, but I don't think that is
a good practice in Axiom).  To handle FUTURE assignments, we can design the code
for unitLength to depend on a state vector for the domain: this state vector
stores one unit for each dimension, and is updated by the setUnitLength and
similar commands. The unitLength (and similar commands) can check this state
vector before generating the Rep. 

But what about those variables already defined, like ulen defined in (1)? If
ulen is used in some computation requiring ulen to be an input parameter, then
we can update it. For example, if the user now wants to compute the area for a
square with side ulen using one of the following syntax:

     uarea := ulen * ulen
     uarea := unitArea(ulen, ulen)

the routine * or unitArea can check the units of its arguments and update them
before computation. However, if the user simply types

     ulen

the interpreter can only redisplay the output (1). The interpreter has no reason
to call the FPS(S) domain to perform an update and change the unit of ulen and
display the output (3). Perhaps the domain FPS(S) should provide a function
update(ulen).
     

 
I made the factor:Union(Float, Symbol) to allow a delay of the computation when
symbolic computation is more prevalent and also when S does not have
RetractableTo(Float).  This still requires S to have RetractableTo(Symbol).  The
exact meaning of factor needs some discussion: perhaps there should be two
factors! One relative to the current system (to provide a relative factor to
convert within this system when users changes a unit, and one relative to SI (to
provide an absolute factor to convert between systems).

Of course not. But that is exactly the point: a dimensionless constant takes on
different dimensions in different conversions or equations. So even thought
these have the same VALUE pi, the pi in C = pi*d and the pi in 180 deg = pi
radians are different because their (hidden) dimensions are different. In each
equation, only their values are the same.

No, dimension of C is length and is not dependent on any equation it is in. This
is a major difference between physical quantities and mathematical constants.
Perhaps we should start using the term "dimension" to mean the one used in the
definition, which may involve derived dimensions, and the term "reduced
dimension" to mean a simplified form in terms of the basic dimensions. Then we
can say the reduced dimensions of pi in both equations are the same, namely 1
(or dimensionless), but the dimensions are different. This terminology would
work to say work and moment have the same reduced dimensions, but their
dimensions are different (when vectors are used to indicate the direction of the
distance with respect to the forces). How vectors may be expressed in dimensions
is another thing to study.

May be, or may be not. It depends on the physical meanings of the variables. If
I have price at $5/m multiplied by 7 m, I should get $35. If I have 8 N divided
by 2 m^2 for pressure, and N has dimension kg-m/s^2, is it ok to cancel one of
the m? So a single rule of Length (m) is not applicable to all cases.

Actually, you scenarios are not narrow but general and right! There should be no
difference between units as used by students and units as used by researchers.
The idea of units is not limited to even SI. Currency conversions are
conversions in monetary units. But we should be able to use Axiom's unit system
for grocery as well (Back to my unfinished idea on different Dimension domains)!
Dimension=Union("Orange", "120z-Coke", ...) is as useful as
Dimension=Union("Mass", "Length", ...). (Yes, a supermarket manager using Axiom,
that'll be the day: not so far-fetched if you think of the operation research
problems involved).

Since you are the master of MathAction, I believe you, although I don't quite
understand. Did I understand correctly: Currently you save the content of every
section into a file and then you say something like

axiom                (start axiom)
for file in filelist
  case type(file) of
    axiom: )re file
     spad: )co file
    aldor: )co file
)qu

So maybe the following could be a solution: have a LaTeX-syntax-wiki-switch
like

\setAxiomVersion{patchnumber}

and

\setAxiomVersionCurrent

that quits the current axiom process and starts a new one with the indicated
pachnumber. Furthermore, these commands should print the indicated
patchnumber... So this would result in the following structure

for version in versionlist
  axiom--version       (start axiom)
  for file in filelist
    case type(file) of
      axiom: )re file
       spad: )co file
      aldor: )co file
  )qu

Would this be doable?

Well, the idea is that I can write on IssueTracker

Up to Axiom version
\setAxiomVersion{44}

the following produced wrong output:
\begin{axiom}
  code formerly producing wrong output
\end{axiom}

However, meanwhile this is fixed, as you can see for example in the current
version 
\setAxiomVersionCurrent

\begin{axiom}
  code formerly producing wrong output
\end{axiom}

Dear Kai,

I just tried to get your code running, but somehow it failed. After entering
any command in the toplevel, I get the following in the clisp terminal:

Yes that is essentially correct except that what you write
as a loop, my program generates as a linear script like this:

1)  extract Axiom sections:
      section_n --> file_n.xx
        where xx =3D 'input' or 'spad' or 'as'

2)  in parallel generate script:

      axiom           (start axiom)
      )re file1.input
      )co file2.spad
      )re file3.input
      )co file4.as
        ...
      )yy file_n.xx
      )qu

        where yy =3D 're' if xx =3D 'spad' else 'co'

3)  execute script

4)  collect output into output1, output2, ... output_n

5)  replace section_n <-- output_n for all n

This is just for the Axiom sections. The same process is repeated
entirely once again for Reduce and then one more time for LaTeX.
Of course it is important that the LaTeX pass come last since it
must process sections created by the previous two passes.

Well, I think what you wrote above would amount to repeating
all n commands m  times, once for each axiom--version.

So in that case I think the following might work:

1)  extract Axiom sections:
      section_n --> file_n.xx
        where xx =3D 'input' or 'spad' or 'as'

2)  in parallel generate script include version changes:

      start axiom -version=3Dcurrent
      )re file1.input
      )co file2.spad
      )qu

      start axiom -version=3D44
      )re file3.input
      )qu

      start axiom -version=3Dcurrent
      )co file4.as
        ...
      )yy file_n.xx
      )qu

3)  execute script and append output of each session

4)  collect output into output1, output2, ... output_n

5)  replace section_n <-- output_n for all n

But when designing the page the author would have to keep in mind
that each version change results in complete loss of context.
The other thing to understand is that stopping and starting Axiom
sessions is much more expensive in computer time than actually
doing most calculations! The more version switches the longer the
author will have to wait when they click 'Save'.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I shall always remember that a famous physicist (Dirac, I think)
once started his presentation at a conference by apologizing that
"he did not have enough time to write a shorter paper" ...

The point being, I guess that it is relatively easy to but down
a lot of poorly organized stuff dealing generally or maybe in too
much detail with partly the wrong stuff, etc. But he made an
apology because he felt that by doing so he was being somewhat
discourteous to his audience. One of his responsibilities as a
writer is to say clearly and exactly what the audience needs to
know and this takes *more* time than being verbose.

A related issue is that we need to take account of the fact
that human beings have some built-in limitations when it comes
to appreciating complex subjects when they are presented with
too many unorganized ideas at once. If it is at all possible
we need to choose a mode of expression that is more powerful,
i.e. say more with less but carefully chosen words. This is
often where mathematics ( =3D 10,000 words) , pictures (=3D 1,000
words) and demonstrations ( =3D 1,00 words) should come into play.

While I appreciate all of the documentation that exists about
Axiom (It is much better than if there was none at all!) but I
am rather afraid that we are already well past the point of having
to apologize to new people who come to our documentation and our
web site to understand as quickly as possible what they need to
know about Axiom. :( Even give Axiom's "30 year horizon" and the
chance that I might actually live that long, I do have doubts that
I will ever end up reading all of the material about Axiom that
we already have.

I am thinking more and more these days that we have to think
about improving the quality of what we have (and therefore
reducing it's length) while at the same time producing more
quantity.

>=20

Aw, proving my point above! In fact I did read all 60+ pages,
but I must say that at some point I began to feel like I had
lost the path to enlightenment. :) So that's when I went back
to the first few emails and put Martin's example code on the
web:

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/UnitsAndDimensions

After seeing Martin's idea work almost exactly in the way you
originally imagined that it might, I became less convinced of
of my original presumption that there should be a close connection
between units/dimensions and Axiom domains.

Now I would like to see what Ralf sketched in Aldor written and
demonstrated in about this same level of detail and functionality.

Then perhaps we could code something similar to William's
approach (to the extent that I understand that it differs from
both Martin and Ralf).

Then after experimenting with these "toy" examples a little,
I expect/hope that I might be able to see it "fall into place".

Some people might be concerned that writing code too soon risks
freezing-in less suitable ideas, but lately I am beginning to
take a more "extreme programming" point of view: writing code
is in fact the whole point of the exercise. Yes it needs to be
documented and understood, but this is (and will often continue
to be) a moving target. We should be prepared to write, correct,
re-write, factor and re-organize our code fluently while making
an effort to keep it clear, concise and easily understood by
others. We need to think-build-experiment-rebuild-rethink-
build ... in an iterative and hopefully inspired manner.

Of course this is not possible. :) Our tools and our skill are
not (yet) quite up to this task. But at least in the open
source world, I think it is clear that this approach works much
better than the classical engineering "design, implement, test,
and sell" model.

There. Now I've probably written more than even I will be
willing re-read and have, finally, illustrated my own point.

Carry on.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

My mistake. There are two ways to fix this. Either download the whole
tar ball again, or just download the file
http://kaikaminski.gmxhome.de/axiom-hub.lisp and put it in the
axiomui/http-server/ dirrectory. That should fix it.

Yet another way to fix this problem is to edit axiom-hub.lisp and make
sure that the variable *static-pages-path* actually points to the
axiomui/static-pages/ directory.

Yes, it is. I just checked. What kind of problem do you have? Is it
the same as Martin's? In any case you will have to replace the file
axiomui/http-server/axiom-hub.lisp with the one available at
kaikaminski.gmxhome.de or download the tar ball again. The version you
downloaded contained a wrong pathname and won't work.

Thanks a lot,
Kai

There are three stages writing a paper goes through:

1)  Where you are trying to pull together enough information that you
can actually cover what you need to to do a proper treatment of a
subject

2)  Where you are trying to write up all of this information in a way
that makes coherent sense

3)  Where you have a good grasp of all the details and essentials of
what you have written and can turn your attention to boiling it down to
its clear, precise essence

I am currently at stage one.  Understanding the subtle issues releated
to Dimensions, Units, and using them "correctly" is not something I am
fully comfortable with, and the first order of business is to get a
good idea of what correct is.  This involves both understanding the
concepts themselves, and expressing them in Axiom - unfortunately I am
busy trying to understand the concepts and have yet to move on to the
Axiom part.

Unfortunately, this is only likely in the case of really mature topics.
 Not to mention that doing this is as much an art as a science, and I
think relatively few people in any disicipline have mastered it.

I think part of the problem (certainly I can speak to my own case) is
that people don't necessarily know "what they need to know".  Axiom is
an environment that enforces correctness, and that is going to cause
problems for people trying to quickly solve casually framed problems. 
It's a more subtle manifestation of the reason lab students don't want
to record units - half the time they don't KNOW what units the
measurement is in, and don't want to try to find out.  So I think a lot
of times Axiom is forcing people to think about things they SHOULD be
thinking about, but want to brush under the rug.  I can't really bring
myself to consider that a bad thing.  We should probably have a way for
people to say things like "I'm dealing only with reals, quit bothering
me about issues related to all these obscure types!" in settings, but
those settings will then be explicit statements of what domains and
constraints are in place.  This should be well defined always, even in
things like physics where they want to get on with it and not worry
about the details.  Provide a working environment, but that working
environment should be based on sound, well defined principles which are
programmed and available, even if the user doesn't have to explicitly
set them all.

There is something I like to call "irreducible complexity" in software,
and in ideas and interfaces as well - some things simply ARE hard. 
Axiom is trying to be correct, and as a result it has to both ask and
answer many many questions that are routinely ignored, treated as a
matter of course in sub-topics of mathematics, or in some cases not
well defined at all.  I may be overestimating the authors and designers
of Axiom, but at this point I have a feeling that the effort to be
fully correct is responsible for much of the verbosity of Axiom.  Being
precise in meaning and correct in definition is a hard, hard problem. 
It is probably impossible to meet those goals and remain readily
comprehensible, simply because most people don't think about things in
a fully precise and correct matter.

I would actually suggest we start thinking seriously about
using/incorporating ACL2 or HOL4 or some such system and using proof
logic, since that is the purest expression of meaning I know.  The hard
part is translating this type of logic into human-friendly English, and
that's where I think most of the verbosity comes in.  That translation
is both necessary and not well defined.

I have a feeling I'll have to play around with things at almost all
levels of detail, including various toy implementations, before I can
try anything "for real."

Uh oh :-).  I tend to prefer the school of do it once, do it right, and
never think about it again - after that just use it ;-).  We've got
Mathematica, Maple, Maxima, and others to "get the job done" - Axiom's
virtues are in doing things the "right way."  

Ultimately, both approaches aren't mutually exclusive.  It just spreads
overall resources a bit thinner, but since Axiom is no longer
commercial and doesn't seem to have much competition in the "Do It
Right" space I'm not too worried ;-).  Many of us are still learning
which end is up in Axiom (and then asking what it means to be up ;-) so
I think things will eventually improve.

Well, define better - it does produce more code, but I'm not convinced
it necessarily produces higher quality code.

Hehe :-).
 
> Carry on.

Will do - distilling things down to their essence is something that a
group of eyeballs is very helpful at.  I may disagree about what the
scope of "essence" is, but I would like to mention one other principle
I have heard over and over in experimental situations:

"There is no such thing as too much information.  It is possible to
function by ignoring irrelevant data, it is impossible to function if
you discover data you considered irrelevant and didn't record has
suddenly become relevant.  Always better to know too much than too
little.  You are far more likely to underestimate what you will need to
know than overestimate."

I think it is possible to define user documentation, which keeps it
simple and straightforward, and programming documentation which should
deal with all relevant issues.  I think pamphlets are the place for the
latter, and the volumes of the Axiom book the place for the former.  Or
did I misunderstand this, Tim?

Note this is not ment to encourage poor or unclear writing, which is an
altogether different matter and something I'm probably guilty of quite
often.

Cheers,
CY

Heh - I'm not actually there yet - I'm currently trying to properly
define things like the meaning of Units and Dimensions (Dimension turns
out to be very tricky to define!) and the thinking behind overall
design concerns. William is way ahead of me right now - I'm not close
yet to translating what I'm learning into Axiom code as such.

Agreed.  After my experience playing with Maxima I'll never ask again
why documenting things is important.

What I'm not sure about is whether or not having things like the
physical basis for SI units documented in the pamphlet is a good thing.
 My thinking on this is yes because a) I like having all possibly
relevant info in one place and b) it's fundamental to the meaning of
units and therefore seems like appropriate knowledge to have in the
Axiom pamphlet file, but it may wind up being enough to make people
roll their eyes at me ;-).  Plus, sometimes a document that is readily
available at one point in time gets harder to find later, or may be
hard to access for someone in another country with limited internet
access, or who knows.  So I tend to favor the idea of a pamphlet file
which is as internally consistent and complete as possible, even at the
risk of verbosity.  But that's just me ;-)  Once I've actually got
something I'll post it and take my lumps.

Cheers,
CY

Yes, this is obvious. It's just a change as changing between reduce and axiom.

Yes, but this wouldn't really matter, since it is supposed to be used only to
document old behaviour. So, I think that two things apply:

* usually there will be only one or two versions used within one page. (On
  IssueTracker two or maybe three, otherwise one)

* when several versions are used within one page, the page is very likely to be
  rather static, i.e., changes will be posted only rarely.

If you could implement this behaviour, I'd be very grateful.

I think that this is a very good idea.

And, I have to say that I think that you are quite right about the amount of
the material. HOWEVER: I dare say that too much documentation (in your sense)
is better than too little documentation.

In fact, I also feel *slightly* (!) at unease with the pamphlet approach. At
least on my computer it does take a little while to display the .dvi file,
searching text in .dvi is not as comfortable as in the .spad file, changing
things in the .pamphlet is not as comfortable either. So I end up experimenting
with the .spad file, then doing an ediff with the old pamphlet. It's ok, but
it's not perfect. An important thing would either be a fantastic pamphlet mode
for emacs or the possibility to retain a little of the documentation in the
source file.

I think that ++, +++ and -- comments might be very helpful in this regard. For
me, personally, it was always obvious that we should maintain the ++ and +++
comments. Meanwhile I think that we should also maintain -- comments. It is not
yet quite clear to me though, what sort of comments should go there so that
they fit in nicely in the pamphlet structure.

Well, I like the quote

"An ideal world is left as an exercise to the reader"...

Dear Kai,

thanks for the update. I tried it and it works. However, the quality of the
graphics is not -- well, not as good as I would have expected. It rather looks
like ascii art. Did I do something wrong?

Hello,

noweb (the tool behind Tim's pamphlets) provides an emacs mode
(noweb-mode). It allows to use simultaneously two modes, latex-mode for
the LaTeX part and another mode for the program part. With most emacs
modes, font coloring and auto indentation is correct (except sometimes
the first line of a code chunk). Maybe you were thinking at more
elaborate things but this is a first start.

For what it's worth, I'm using following code in my .emacs:

;; To have noweb mode automatically
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.pamphlet$"  . noweb-mode)
                ) auto-mode-alist))

;; many thanks to Hubert Canon <hcanon@alussinan.org> for this code
(add-hook 'noweb-mode-hook 'my-noweb-set-mode-code)
(defun my-noweb-set-mode-code ()
  (let* ((filename (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name))

Hi Martin,

thanks for your patience.

The plots need some improvements, but I don't think that they look
like ASCII art, so presumably something's going wrong.

To find out what it is, please visit kaikaminski.gmxhome.de and look
at the files 1.png, 2.png and 3.png. They correspond to the three plot
commands from the README. If your output doesn't look like this,
something is wrong.

The files 1.svg, 2.svg and 3.svg contain the SVG output from AxiomUI
that is used to display the plots in your browser window. They were
also used to generate the three PNG files with ImageMagick (convert
foo.svg foo.png). Please download them and load them from your
harddisk in your browser (loading them directly off my web site might
not work, because my provider is too stupid to send the correct
content type). If they don't display correctly then there is probably
a problem with your browser's SVG support. All three files are valid
SVG 1.1 according to the W3C validator and ImageMagick, Safari and
Firefox (Deer Park 2 for Linux) display them correctly.

I seem to remember that you're using Konqueror. The version of
Konqueror that is installed on my Linux box (3.4) does not display
them correctly. In fact it only displays a few ASCII letters, some of
which seem to be from the plot title. Is that what you see?

There seems to be an SVG project for Konqueror, but I don't know if
that is already integrated into Konqueror and how well it works. Maybe
upgrading Konqueror helps, maybe it doesn't.


Thanks,
Kai

Description: --
This category is an implementation of interval arithmetic and
transcendental functions over intervals.

**Note:** -- It appears to be nearly identical to the SPAD category
'interval.spad'.

  interval : (R,R) -> %;
    ++ interval(inf,sup) creates a new interval, either \axiom{[inf,sup]} if
    ++ \axiom{inf <= sup} or \axiom{[sup,in]} otherwise.
  qinterval : (R,R) -> %;
    ++ qinterval(inf,sup) creates a new interval \axiom{[inf,sup]}, without
    ++ checking the ordering on the elements.
  interval : R -> %;
    ++ interval(f) creates a new interval around f.
  interval : Fraction Integer -> %;
    ++ interval(f) creates a new interval around f.
  inf : % -> R;
    ++ inf(u) returns the infinum of \axiom{u}.
  sup : % -> R;
    ++ sup(u) returns the supremum of \axiom{u}.
  width : % -> R;
    ++ width(u) returns \axiom{sup(u) - inf(u)}.
  positive? : % -> Boolean;
    ++ positive?(u) returns \axiom{true} if every element of u is positive,
    ++ \axiom{false} otherwise.
  negative? : % -> Boolean;
    ++ negative?(u) returns \axiom{true} if every element of u is negative,
    ++ \axiom{false} otherwise.
  contains? : (%,R) -> Boolean;
    ++ contains?(i,f) returns true if \axiom{f} is contained within the interval
    ++ \axiom{i}, false otherwise.

That's probably too generous - I've started trying to become informed
enough to start real work, really.  Bill is probably going to flinch
when he sees my idea of basic pre-code (heck, it's really pure
background) documentation :-).

No hurry - you're still far ahead of me when it comes to thinking about
Units/Dimensions in Axiom.  Indeed, you've introduced a new idea I
really like which alters my thinking about basic term definitions that
need to be made and used (more on that later ;-).  I'll reply in parts,
since it's too long for me to have time to sit down and go through at
once.

I hope so, although I suspect your ideas are far more useful than my
own - I'm just asking questions and swatting user level features around
in my head at this point.  The hard part (and interesting part) is
expressing them in relation to Axiom's mathematical rigor.

Reminds me of working on the Maxima package - I defined several
functions I only realized I would want after I began writing the basic
user documentation.  I think I might still be having conceptual
trainwreaks in my head because of the work on Maxima - some of my
comments below might be a result of this :-/.

Sounds good.  I apologize in advance for how basic some of my questions
below will be - I tried to review as much as possible of earlier
discussions, but I may have regressed some after a rather busy week at
work.

Off topic, but shouldn't it be checking $HOME/.axiom or some such as
well?  Or is it assumed that a user has write access to $AXIOM?

This isn't quite what I was thinking - I was thinking by default Axiom
could use a unit system called CurrentUnitSystem, which would be
somewhat different in definition from SI, CGS, etc.  Doing 

)set UnitSystem SI

would drop the user in a strict SI output only environment without the
possibility of local override, which I have no problem with.  (Might
even be a good idea to have available, really - call it a STATIC
UnitSystem definition.)  What i would like CurrentUnitSystem to do is
be a DYNAMIC UnitSystem, using either the system you have outlined
below or something similar.  It would start out as an instance of the
SI definitions by default, but allow local overrides dynamically (hence
a Dynamic UnitSystem definition).  Also useful would be a
SaveUnitSystem(<NewUnitSystemName>) for later use - essentially
allowing a user to load a precustomized Dynamic UnitSystem Definition
as the working UnitSystem.  With a Dynamic UnitSystem Definition we
could have a MapUnitSystem(<UnitSystem name>) command to allow the user
to restore all STATIC SI definitions (say) to the CurrentUnitSystem. 
Is that following what you had in mind?

Yes, that's certainly something we will want to do.  (I'm still
plotting to allow the user to gobble up all the unit names in the
default namespace at their option, and that will DEFINITELY need
interpreter work.

Did you intend to use this setup for ALL UnitSystems or just what I've
termed Dynamic UnitSystems?  (Sorry if I should have caught this.)

I don't quite understand s:S - can you give a specific example of this
difference?  Also, I'm not following why you would want to make any
local vs. global distinctions here - wouldn't it be neater just to have
the set commands work in the CurrentUnitSystem, and base things off of
Static UnitSystems for definitions unless a totally custom conversion
is being defined?  Working in a Static UnitSystem no set commands are
either possible or necessary (and thus shouldn't work) and in a Dynamic
UnitSystem (of which there will normally be only one - the working one)
the Static UnitSystems provide the information to use in the Dynamic
one?

I would have thought all you needed was a single command SetUnits()
command, which would take a minimum of one argument and a max of one
unit per available dimension, e.g.

SetUnits(nm,N,inches);

In the CurrentUnitSystem Dynamic UnitSystem (assuming things are in
default mode) the "state vectors" for the dimensions corresponding to
the units entered would be updated.  It's not clear to me why you would
need any other arguments, unless you wanted to make sure the user knows
the dimension of the unit they are inputing as a default.  Dimensions
may not always map uniquely to Units, but Units DO map uniquely to
dimensions.  Couldn't Axiom figure this out?  All it has to do is
determine the dimension of each argument, check that all dimensions are
unique, and set the defaults (the setunits command in Maxima works this
way.)  We ARE back to some parser being able to check all units for a
match to the input unit, I guess. Is that why you're adding the extra
arguments - to avoid Axiom needing to figure out that nm is a Length
defined in the SI UnitSystem?  Maybe I place too much emphasis on user
convenience but I as a user would prefer not to tell Axiom things it
already knows.  Maybe as a time saving alternative SetUnits could also
accept things of the form <UnitSystem>::Unit or some such, which would
limit the search space it would need to check?  Or even better, if
Axiom is up to it we might also be able to build a toplevel hash table
of all defined units in all unit systems at compile time which can
quickly match up a unit up with a UnitSystem and Dimension.  Since
Static UnitSystems wouldn't be changable in a normal session anyway (at
least without editing the source and reloading, which hopefully would
also mandate a rebuild of the hash tree) it would be a one time expense
and would enable considerable user convenience at many levels.  In the
SetUnits usage it doesn't even need to use up toplevel namespace, and
if a user DID want to populate the toplevel namespace it would be a big
speedup for the interperter to be able to hash a symbol to check if it
is a unit.

I don't think I'm quite following - Derived Units are defined in terms
of the Base Units for their UnitSystem - just because we are now using
"cm" instead of "m" as our default length doesn't change the definition
of N, or how many Newtons we have.  If we want to report a Derived Unit
in terms of Base Units, then we would want to use cm instead of m, but
otherwise I'm afraid I'm missing something.

As for current variables, shouldn't they be updated automatically by
the global update?

Cheers,
CY

I only have Mozilla (Konqueror doesn't work at all, as I reported earlier on),
and rendering the svg files from your website results in something that looks
quite like your plots, just using ASCII art...

Don't know what to do, but I think I'll just wait until Konqueror is supported,
since I don't want to use Mozilla anyway. I was using

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030630

I just tried the svg-graphics on konqueror: to my great surprise, they worked
without a problem... So maybe it's easier to fix Konqueror support :-)

The "only" thing which doesn't work is: when you press enter in the toplevel,
nothing happens...

Just another question:

is SVG capable of doing the things that the axiom viewer axiom2D and axiom3D
can do?

So they look a very different from the PNG files, I suppose? Do you
like the PNG plots or don't you like them either. The reason I ask is
that it might be reasonably easy to send PNG to the browser instead or
provide that as an option at least. In fact PNG support would be nice
anyway, since then we could display Axiom plots in Emacs.

There are two potential problems I can think of. First of all SVG
support is still somewhat shaky in Mozilla and Firefox, so you might
have to use a development build. I wouldn't recommend this, though,
since Firefox 1.5 is due in a few days. The second problem is that
with some Mozilla/Firefox builds one has to enable SVG support
first. To do that, load about:config and look for an option like
svg_enabled and set it to true.

Thanks for your patience,
Kai

The plots themselves are good. But in png I assume there is no panning,
zooming, rotating, ...

There is no such option as svg_enabled in my about:config. I suppose that my
Mozilla is too old. Note however, that it does "work". Only the quality is
*very* low.

My Konqueror is 3.1.4.

I'm using java 1.4.2, and it should work with pretty much any java
supporting 1.3 or later.

Patches should be fine, they're independent of the libaxiom.al build.

Greetings!  There are just a few probe-file -> truename patches
required.  Should I apply these to the April 2005 sources and make a
Debian release?  Or is there a later official savannah version coming?

Take care,

There are some patches emminent to support the Aldor integration.
With those in place the optional install of the Aldor binaries
would be much easier.

Wouldn't it be great to have Aldor on Debian?

I am very much in favor of Martin Rubey's suggestion that we
petition Stephen Watt to release Aldor as open source. Or perhaps
we might be able to convince him to let the Axiom Foundation
release Aldor.

What do you think?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Camm,

I applied some probe-file -> truename patches already.
Should this conversion be universally applied?
If so I can just wander thru the sources and do it.

One other item -- Debian is migrating to gcc-4.0, which entails a
non-binary-compatible lbrary change.  Axiom as currently packaged is
now uninstallable in Debian unstable, so I'd like to resolve this
quickly.  I can either patch what I have (20050201, or use this
opportunity to upgrade the sources.  Suggestions?

Take care,

Tim: that shouldn't be hard, right? (I know, there is no such thing as a simple
job).  Put some of the user-specific configuration file like axiom.input in the
user's home directory as a $HOME/.axiom file? Obviously such setup is not
portable, but possible and desirable if the PC is no longer "personal".

Camm,

apply the changes, do a 
   diff -Naur original changed >changed.patch
and send me the patch files. I'll merge them into the
sources and test them before release.

I've applied Peter's changes as well as a few of my own and
I'm in the process of testing the --patch-45 release at the
moment. I expect it to go out real-soon-now.

Not being particularly familiar with Aldor and its capabilities, I can
infer from the comments I've heard here about it that it is well worth
releasing if possible.  I thought there were some licensing issues
outstanding.  If these can be resolved, I'd be most happy to package
for Debian and add to the effective gcl regression/application suite
of maxima,acl2 and axiom.  Does Aldor require axiom?

Am afraid I'm a bit short on time right now for corresondence, so it
would be most helpful if someone else could get release permission
commensurate with the DFSG.

I can add

commands with defaults if desired. We just have to agree on the
reasons, the names, and the values.

There is a tree of variable initializations in src/interp/setvart

No need to abandon probe-file if your just trying to see if a certain
*file* exists.  If you are trying to get a full path, that's what
truename is for.

If you want the other patches I currently have in the Debian package
vs 20050201 (previously posted to the list) again, please let me know.

Take care, and thanks for your work on Axiom!!!

BTW, is there an FC4 fix I can apply to the code, or does FC4 require
root disabling of certain randomization via

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

?  

May need a small 2.6.7 errata for ia64 and arm in any case.

Take care,

That sounds good, I think - I would propose using this more general, flexible 
representation only in a single instance of a Dynamic UnitSystem - SI and CGS 
wouldn't need it, if I understand correctly.

Generality is good, but I'm afraid I'm not following - for any given Unit, 
wouldn't all you need to know be the description of that unit in terms of SI?  
Or are you proposing that all UnitSystems use this extended storage record?  
I would suggest using it only for the Dynamic UnitSystems, and then you have 
the flexibility to define new units in terms of SI which have no existing 
Static definition.

This is definitely interesting, but I'm not sure we want such an ability to be 
the default - I would suggest hiding the conversion factors unless the user 
specifically specifies otherwise.  I like the idea of the ability to 
explicitly show them though :-).

In general, I like this (I would prefer to simplify the setDim("Length", len) 
syntax as mentioned in the previous email, but I don't know if anyone else 
agrees with me as to whether my proposal there makes any sense.)

Heh :-).   We need some "official" source for the various standards and 
conversions, I think - NIST conveniently supplies the SI definitions, but 
beyond that I'm not sure where free, official online info would be.

Yes, I agree - don't update the derived dimensions.

I'm not sure about the need for two factors, except perhaps as a matter of 
efficiency in avoiding common conversion lookups - is that the reason?

Sounds good, in broad.

Does that mean an interpreter update is needed.?

I think the latter is a matter of convenience - converting relative to the 
current system is also doable via input unit -> SI -> output unit - if I 
understand you what you are doing is precompressing this two step process 
into one for the default "output" system?

OK - so how to we represent this in a  CAS?  Or more specifically, what about 
the fact that a dimensionless constant has dimension that cancels is useful 
for us to display, and how do we go about it?

So we are going to have to distinguish between them somehow?  What do we want 
there?

YES!  This is an excellent suggestion, and might provide a way to address an 
issue that has been bothering me:

Let's say we work with both work and moment, in two different equations, and 
both calculations would simplify down to length if we cancel out units.  
Presumably those lengths have the same dimension, but they sprang from two 
different equations that would not be the same dimensionally if I were to use 
proper derived dimension simplification rules, despite their both winding up 
with a length falling out.  I think being able to say work and moment have 
the same reduced dimensions would allow us to perform calculations, simply 
noting that the length is a reduced length by virtue of being calculated from 
a quantity involving ambiguous substitution.

Hopefully that was clear enough to express my concerns.  I don't know if they 
would crop up or not in the "real world" - if this is too confusing I can try 
and construct an example (gulp).

This will need to be handled, somehow.  Are there any good references that 
contain the applicable rules for us to implement?

Heh - neat :-).  But it does raise some awkward questions, which came up 
briefly earlier but escaped my notice:

You mentioned $ interacting with meters, and in a previous email kilobits and 
kilobytes were also mentioned.  Unfortunately, neither money nor bits of 
information are covered by any combination of SI units I am aware of.  So 
perhaps our top level category should be not simply Dimensions but 
PhysicalDimensions, and we could perhaps implement some other Categories for 
Dimensions not covered by SI (like money and bits, both of which are Basic 
Units as far as I can tell).  Money might be defined in terms of other things 
in some sense, but that definition is as complex as society itself and ever 
changing.  Fascinating issues, but perhaps those should wait for later.  
Indeed, does it even make sense to include a concept like money in a system 
intending to stick to strict mathematics as much as possible?  I suppose yes 
since we can think of practical uses, but thinking about it is making my head 
hurt ;-).

Again, sorry William if my comments are not well informed/useless.  I think my 
two concrete suggestions worth considering might be to use a hash table of 
all units for mapping operations, and to allow two types of UnitSystem 
definitions - Static, for unchanging (or not normally changing) definitions 
like SI, and a Dynamic environment set up to use your records idea to be 
flexible and responsive to the user.  As a reminder, feel free to ignore me 
since you are clearly much further and better versed in this than I am.

Cheers,
CY

Kai,

I tried to build AxiomUI from tla axiom--GUI--1 but I ran into
a problem.

After modifying the first two lines of the Makefile and
Makefile.pamphlet to correspond to the location of where
notangle was built by the Axiom build like this:

TANGLE=/home/wspage/axiom--main--1/mnt/fedora3/bin/lib/notangle -t8
WEAVE=/home/wspage/axiom--main--1/mnt/fedora3/bin/lib/NOWEave -delay

I then did

  make

The result was the following error:

...

Of course, I shouldn't have hard-coded the paths and I fixed that
now.

The problem with the AXCOM package happened, because when you called
'make', it tried to execute the following rule (the first rule of this
kind):

axiom-com.lisp: axiom-com.lisp.pamphlet
                @${TANGLE} axiom-com.lisp.pamphlet > axiom-com.lisp

This, of course, failed, because ${TANGLE} couldn't be found. But at
that time 'make' (the shell, in fact) had already created
axiom-com.lisp as an empty file. When you called 'make' again with the
paths fixed but without calling 'make clean' first, the package AXCOM
did indeed not exist, but the file axiom-com.lisp did, so it wasn't
rebuild. Hence the solution is to delete axiom-com.lisp (or call 'make
clean') and then call 'make all' again

Dear C.Y.:

Thanks for your comments. I have combined your two responses and rearrang=

You are welcome to ignore or include in your work/paper any ideas I prese=

The hardest part is knowing questions to ask, and second is figuring out =

No need to apologize (though I sometimes do myself). I too have short (if=

This comment of yours is based on your breaking up UnitSystem into Static=
 and
Dynamic Unit System. This is certainly possible, but see my comments in t=
he
section on Static vs Dynamic user environment, which will list some pros =
and
cons on this break up.

The relative factor can either be built-in for the UnitSystem domain, or =
via the
SI mechanism. But we have to remember that SI is not universal (supermark=
et
manager example). So a relative factor setup solves the general situation=
 and is
also more efficient. The SI approach is mainly for scientific application=
s AND
conversion between two drastically different systems. Believe me, in less=
 than
30 years, symbolic computations will be used by economists, if not alread=
y.
(Mathematica has an operations research package, sold separately).

Yes, I am more in favor of every UnitSystem domain being dynamic (again, =
see
that section). As to shortening the Rep, yes, in principle, for "scientif=
ic"
unit systems, it only needs a conversion factor relative to SI, and yes, =
for
static unit systems, the relative conversion factors are not needed eithe=
r.
However, SI is not everything, so the relative factors will be needed in =
those
cases, and SI may be replaced by another standard unit system.

No, the extra arguments in the new Rep are for convenience of implementat=
ion and
efficiency in execution. Axiom still has to verify, on user input via the=

setDimUnit commands, that the unit is a legitimate unit for the dimension=

specified, even though, as you insist, we allow units outside of the curr=

unit system. This verification is faciliated by the UnitConversion domain=

What you meant then is to have something like:

    setSymbolicConversion(): Boolean

as default True, which will include symbolic conversion factors. Setting =
this
False will use numerical values. However, if you meant that when I
setDimUnit("Length", "cm",x) and x was in "m" originally that it will out=

only x [cm] instead of x m2cm [cm], then I don't agree.

In the setDimUnit, 'setDimUnit' commands, an expression s:S is involved, =
where S
is a domain that usually contains symbols ("RetractableTo Symbol" in Axio=
m
jargon) and s:S means s is such an expression. Of course S can be just Fl=
oat if
no symbols are involved, in which case, expressions and variables are sim=
ply
constants.  But the user assigns a dimension and unit to an expression, w=
hich
will change the way certain variables involved in the expression are inpu=
tted or
outputted. This setting is for a specific expressions s, so has "local" s=
cope.
The other 'setUnit' is local for a specific dimension, but has a wider sc=
ope and
affects all expressions of that dimension. Finally, the 'setUnitAll' is g=
lobal
in the sense that all derived dimensions involving that specific dimensio=
n and
all expressions in all those derived dimensions will be affected. The
implementation will be assisted by the UnitConversion domain and the Rep
remembers the conversion factors both relative to the current system and =
to the
SI system, when possible.

My proposal allows (but the decision is still open) changing the units fo=
r a
single expression s:S -- 'setDimUnit(dim,u,s)'. It also allows changing t=
he unit
of a single dimension, say Length, in the current (loaded) unit system wi=
thout
affecting other derived dimensions that involve Length -- 'setUnit(dim,u)=
'.
Finally it allows changing the unit of a single dimension, say Length, an=
d any
other derived dimension that involves Length, such as Velocity --
'setUnitAll(dim, u)'. In your example above, changing the unit of Length =
from
"m" to "cm" will report the unit of Force (the dimension of "N") either s=
till as
"N", if 'setUnit(Length,"cm")' is used in SI; or as kg-cm/s^2 (by changin=
g the
value of any expression with dimension Force by a conversion factor m2cm)=
, if
'setUnitAll(Length,"cm")' is used in SI; in which case, the new unit of "=
Force"
is "kg-cm/s^2" or "kilodyne", following SI prefix convention (basically c=
hanging
SI, which is MKS based, to CGS).

I assume you are referring to the 'setUnit(nm,N,inches)' suggestion. See =

Yes, see also section below. Each expression requires one lookup at the t=
ime its
dimension and unit is set. All subsequent uses and display will avoid the=
 lookup
again even if, in case of a variable, it is reassigned to a different val=
ue. All
necessary conversion is taken care of by the arithmetic operation in the
UnitSystem domain.

I hope not! The 'update()' function can handle that. We should not modify=
 the
Interpreter for this project unless it is absolutely necessary, which so =
far, I
don't see. It is possible for the 'setDimUnit' function in the UnitSystem=
 domain
to record all calls to the 'setDimUnit' command to create and maintain a =
live
list of variables or expressions, say as part of the state vector. An upd=
ate can
either be applied for just one variable in the domain, or all variables i=
n this
live list.


---------- Implementation issues: Updating variables and their units

Some updating questions are raised and solutions suggested in the Scenari=

Example section above.

That is the idea. That is, a 'setUnitAll(dim, u)' command will change all=
 output
and input variables/expressions that are of dimension dim to use unit u. =
In the
scenario Example section, we discussed the issues and some possible actio=
ns. The
basic design question to decide is: should this global command affect onl=
y newer
variables/expressions or should this retroactively set all existing
variables/expressions? The basic implementation question is: what data
structures will support these functionalities efficiently (bear in mind s=
ome
trade offs between memory and CPU time, as usual)? It seems the proposed
state-vector can support the implementation, whatever the decisions.

[NB, Axiom convention:function names should start with lower case]

I do not quite follow. Your example has three arguments, all units of Len=
gth. I
think you are thinking of 'setUnitAll(dim, u)'? Maybe a simpler 'setAll(u=
)' and
let the system figure out the dimension of u? (But as explained below, th=
is
reverse lookup from unit to dimension is not unique; in that case, we can=
 make
'setAll(u)' return an error message with some choices (probably not all p=
ossible
choices). So you would still need the version 'setUnitAll(dim,u)' after t=
he user
picks one of those choices.

Your line:

  SetUnits(nm,N,inches);

is, as far as I can follow, a global set. Surely, in this simple example,=
 Axiom
can figure out that these (nm, N, inches) (aside: use "in" for "inches" -=
- SI
recommendations) are units for Length, but as explained, this is not poss=
ible in
general. My version 'setUnitAll(dim, u)" only does this for a particular
dimension dim and a particular unit u. I don't know why you set the Lengt=
h
dimension to THREE different units. Are you imagining mixing units for th=
e same
dimension in one session? How are you going to tell which variable/expres=
sion
will use any one of these three units? Are you saying that ALL three unit=
s
should be reported for ANY variable/expressions of dimension Length? (Not=
e: even
if you are mixing units, the Rep will support it. I just want to know wha=
t your
line meant.)

Fair enough. We can ALWAYS add defaults. The example I gave in my last me=
ssage
(added above in Section on UnitSystem specification):

   setDim(dim: Dimension, s:S):% =3D=3D setDimUnit: (dim, unit(dim), s)

performs a lookup for the default unit for a given dimension in the curre=
nt
UnitSystem. The 'setAll(u)' above can handle cases where an automatic loo=
kup
results in a unique dimension to set the dimension field in Rep. However =
we do
not want to look up repeatedly each time we use a variable, so the result=
s are
memorized in Rep. =


And, yes, users should know the dimension of the unit they are inputting.=
 One
danger with something like 'setAll(u)',  which left out the dimension for=
 u, is
that a simple typo say from 'setAll(cm^2)' to 'setAll(cm^3)' would not be=
 caught
and play havoc in subsequent computations. Forcing the user to give the i=
ntended
dimension provides a better chance that these errors will be caught.

I don't follow the syntax of <UnitSystem>::Unit. Is :: coercion in Axiom?=
 I have
not heard of coercing a domain into a category. Perhaps you are thinking =
of a
package call to a domain in UnitSystems? That would be setAll(u)$domain. =
But I
do not like this default setAll(u) for reasons above.

The UnitConversion domain (perhaps category) is for this purpose. I am st=
ill
thinking about whether UnitConversion should be a category with many doma=
ins or
just one domain. The many-domain approach may provide better efficiency f=
or more
localized conversion systems and flexibility future additions.

As we don't know all the expert areas now in existence, nor do we know wh=
at new
derived dimension or unit we may need (especially in 30 years' time), the=
re is
no way we can have such a universal toplevel hash table. We CAN implement=
 SI
(all the default and acceptable dimensions and units) or even more, but s=
uch a
domain will need to be revised to allow newer dimensions and units. The d=

should allow arbitrary UnitSystems (as I also indicated in my last email,=

Your last remark is wrong, unless there are already standard terminology =
such as
in the case of Work vs Moment: standard energy-units exist as Joule, erg,=
 eV,
etc. and moment-units exist as N-m, etc. In other cases, you may have to =
create
new standard names first. However, the problem still is: given some unit =
in
reduced basic dimensions such as (mass-length/time^2).length, say kg.m^2/=
s^2, we
do not know if the dimension should be Energy (either Work or Kinetic Ene=

Potential Energy) or Moment. Vectorizing some of these dimensions may hel=

is a force vector times a length vector, and so is moment, but the two le=

vectors have different directions with respect to the direction of the fo=

What you are describing is the "forward" direction, which is easy. The pr=
oblem
to map units back to dimension is the "backward" direction, which has no =
clean
solution (yet?). You will need a parser if the Dimensions and Units are
represented by variables taking up namespace (as in Mathematica, and I as=

in your Maxima implementation). My proposal avoids this modification to t=

Axiom Interpreter. (see also Namespace issues below).

All Axiom variables are typed. So once a user started computating using a=

UnitSystem domain, say A, all his computations will be in that unit syste=
m. If
he then change to SI, he would have to coerce them to SI, which may or ma=
y not
be possible, depending on what dimensions and units are in A. (So, the do=
main A,
and the UnitSystems category, may have to include functions like convertI=
fCan: %
-> SI).

I think you want somehow to restrict some users (say students who are lea=
rning
about units and dimensions) not to allow them to "mess" with a UnitSystem=
 domain
like SI. I don't see the necessity because most likely, such users will o=
nly
want to do their computations in whatever unit system is the default. Eve=
n if
they were to use 'setDimUnit', 'setUnit', and 'setUnitAll' (which would b=
e a
good experience), these only affect the interpreter session and will not =
modify
the SI domain at all. The state-vector does not survive an axiom reload s=
ince no
modification to the compiled code is performed. Also a user can save the =
history
of all inputs, including all 'set' commands (and also ')set' commands) an=
d put
them in axiom.input or a 'myunitmod.input' and read it in anytime. There =
is no
need, in this dynamic design, to modify ANY compiled domain in the UnitSy=
stem
category. When a user wants to have modification compiled into a modSI do=
main,
he will have to edit the SI.spad.pamphlet and change it into modSI.spad.p=
amphlet
and compile it. However, I don't see the necessity. Your idea of
'SaveUnitSystem(<newUnitSystemName>) is difficult (but not impossible) to=

implement and involves automatically editing say SI.spad.pamphlet to
modSI.spad.pamphlet and automatically compiling it. It is trivial for a u=
ser to
read in an input file instead.

I note that each of our positions on this user environment issue has turn=
ed 180
degrees from earlier communications :-).

The ')set unitsystem <UnitSystem name>' will only need to preload <UnitSy=
stem
name>. Tim already said that this can be added. Once loaded, it becomes w=
hat you
called CurrentUnitSystem (but without the name). The <UnitSystem name> ca=
n be
either static or dynamic, depending on whether the three 'set' commands a=
re
implemented or not in that domain. The SI system can be restored by simpl=
y
issuing another ')set unitsystem SI' command. In fact, another way to loa=
d any
unitsystem is simply to say ')library <UnitSystem name>', just like loadi=
ng any
other library, so we don't even need to add the ')set unitsystem' command=
,
although the ')set unitsystem' command perhaps can avoid some package cal=
ls when
the 'set' commands are used.

A "dynamic" unit system domain becomes static if the user does not use an=
y of
the 'set' commands from the domain or if they are not implemented in the =
domain.

Right, see previous comments. A StaticUnitSystem domain in your sense is =
nothing
but a table for pairing dimensions and units. So this is included in
UnitConversion domain (basically a database). It would be just a differen=
ce in
names. =

Of course, whatever has been compiled is static, but since we are to prov=
ide
(again, as you insist -- a good thing) dynamic changes to a loaded unit s=
ystem,
there is really no need to "automatically" modify library code to change =
a
static unit system. I remember you were oppose to this when I was defendi=
ng the
old proposal that you can compile as many UnitSystem domains as you like,=

modifying standard ones as little or as much as you like. Since this auto=
mation
to modify library code to generate a new compilable spad source is diffic=
ult
(remind you that this should be a documented pamphlet file, requiring exp=
ertise
in using automatic editors), and may contribute to a proliferation of dom=
ains
only for personal use, I have moved to the dynamic model to satisfy user =
needs.
A user can easily set up the axiom.input file to load a bunch of interpre=
ter
code, which includes setDimUnit, setUnit, setUnitAll lines before proceed=
ing.
The user is in total control and no system level work (like automatic edi=
ting
spad files) is required.

Requiring rebuilding the hash tree is not a good idea because a domain is=

supposedly stable once built. Plus, if someone adds a new UnitSystem doma=
in, who
would be responsible to rebuild the single hash tree? If the new domain
introduces new dimensions and units, it should create a corresponding
UnitConversion domain (hash tree) and leave the standard hash table alone=

As you know, I am strongly against "gobbling up all the unit names in the=

default namespace' even if it is 'at their option'.  If you are seriously=

thinking about student use, you know the average students will exercise t=

options without knowing or understanding what they are doing. There is no=
 way to
consistently reserve SOME unit names in namespace, and not others. Any co=

the abbreviations in SI units at a minimum. You would have created a nigh=

in using the interpreter by requiring users to avoid any SI unit abbrevia=

as user variables. No computer language ever has that many reserved words=
=2E Note:
Axiom function names are NOT reserved, but constructor (which may be cate=

domain or package) names and their abbreviations are.

Modifying the interpreter because of a specific category or its domains i=

idea. Any modifications should be general purpose or fixing bugs.

Yes. I believe this would make it easy for UnitSystem domains to inherit =
the
default implementations by a few simple modifications. (In the end, only =
the
actual coding will tell if this is possible).  I do not distinguish betwe=
en
static and dynamic. Every unitsystem domain is dynamic. But if you like, =
you can
have them separately specified. Then a StaticUnitSystem category would no=
t have
the three 'set' functions exported and a DynamicUnitSystem category is a
StaticUnitSystem with the three 'set' functions (and perhaps others). The=

problem with this dual approach is that if after computing with a
StaticUnitSystem domain, a user suddenly decides to change the unit of on=
e of
the dimensions, he would have to either redo the computations, or to coer=
ce
everything from the static domain to a CORRESPONDING dynamic domain. Ther=
e is no
enforcable mechanism to guarantee that every static domain has a correspo=
nding
dynamic domain, and if this latter guarantee holds, then we are duplicati=
ng all
unit systems for something not that useful. Most users will want to have =
more
flexibility. I think even for student use, if they want to experiment wit=
h
changing units (at run time), why should that be forbidden? (for that mat=
ter,
Axiom being open sourced, why should ANYTHING be forbidden?)

My proposal uses up NO user namespace for the dimensions or units. It use=
s only
strings as fake domain names. Strings are data items, not a name. The mor=
e
familiar one is the "failed" (a "domain"!) in Union(..., "failed"). This =
is the
built-in magic implementation of Union. A lookup requires only the case s=
tatment
and presumably implemented efficiently already.

There is perhaps one way to use variables (instead of strings) for dimens=
ions
and units, but they will be local to the domain (using domain namespace, =
rather
than user namespace) and they will not be assigned any value. The advanta=
ge over
strings is that they can be used to perform arithmetic operations of
multiplication and division as symbols. Then general conversion factors c=
an be
computed by setting up a small number of conversion rules and by solving =
an
equation. =


Default relationship (tables) for conversion tables (which include both
dimensions and units) and the dependencies like state-vectors, can use ha=
sh
tables.

We can do this:

  piInEqn1:=3D setDimUnit("Length/Length", "m/m", %pi)

or =


  piInEqn1:=3D setDimUnit("1", "1", %pi)

but =


  piInEqn2:=3D setDimUnit("Degree/Radian", "deg/rad", %pi)

Perhaps we can add a field to Rep that gives the reduced dimension as wel=

provide a function

See comments to previous question. The function reduce("Length/Length") w=

Yes, unless given other examples, I think this is a way to get out of the=

dilemma. Of course, the strong typing of Axiom already drove developers n=

and I'm afraid, surely, the strict setup to dimensions and units may like=

so to scientists or economists. This is the price to pay for insisting on=

Don't know if it is useful. It reduces all dimensions to Length and Time,=
 which
are related, said the author, via the speed of light. Does any one know m=
ore
about this article?

There is also a theory of dimensions for economic quantities, published i=
n 1871!
(III.43):

http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnPE3.html

and historically, it seems Fourier introduced the theory of dimensions in=
 1822
(Th=E9orie de Chaleur, Article 160). The article below is worth reading:

http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/webonly/wex80905.html

Fourier's notion of homogeneity should strike a resonance.

Whether any such references will help us develop the rules to simplify
dimensions, I don't know. From what we have discussed, it seems any rule =
will
need some expert knowledge (in the example I gave, the expert knowledge i=
s
simply what pressure is). So I believe the best solution may be to "leave=
 it to
the users", and let them create their own names and simplification rules.=
 This
means that in a UnitSystem domain, there ought to be facilities to handle=
 rules
of simplifications, where some common defaults can be implemented. Axiom =
has a
RewriteRule domain that can help. RewriteRule can also be used efficientl=
y to
perform conversion. (I once wrote a UnitConversion.nb in Mathematica for =
a
course using this idea: all conversion factors between the two units for =
the
same dimension is then a simple Solve[unit1 =3D x unit2, x])

"Now, you're thinking!" :-)

In my case, thinking about these things make me stare at the screen and t=

fall asleep! But you got a point here, building unit systems should inclu=

at least allow future inclusion, of systems outside of the usual scientif=

Kai,

Thanks for your lastest tla axiom-GUI--1--patch-2. Below I have
included an additional patch to use the $AXIOM variable instead
of hardcoding paths or depending on implicit paths. This is
consistent with the approach used in the current Axiom build.

I am obviously writing this email in a little more detail than you
require :) but I am also cc'ing to axiom-developer list in case
these notes help anyone elso try this.

With your tla patch-2 and this patch I successfully built axiomUI
web-gui on my Fedora Core 3 x86-64 system.

I also upgraded my Firefox browser to DeerPark Alpha 2 from here:

http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox

using the link 'Deer Park Alpha 2 for Linux (English)' which
downloads 'deerpark-alpha2.installer.tar.gz'. I untarred and
ran the installer and now I start it with the command:

  /usr/local/firefox/firefox&

This is what I noticed so far:

1) All intermediate and binary files are created in the
   'src/web-gui' directory. As a minimum, to be (more or less)
   compatible with the Axiom build intermediate files should
   go into directory 'int/web-gui' and the binaries/executables
   should go into 'mnt/bin'

2) run-axiom-ui.sh does not have executable flag. It needs

   chmod a+x run-axiom-ui.sh

3) Running

   ./run-axiom-ui.sh

   produces no initial startup message. Something re-assuring
   and informative like:

   "Waiting for browser http:/127.0.0.1:5050"

   would be nice :)

4) 'make doc' does not run because the current Axiom build does
   not put noweb.sty into the /usr/share/texmf tree. Instead the
   path is hard coded. You could use this convention, in which
   case the file should be named '${AXIOM}/bin/tex/noweb.sty'
   but perhaps better, the Axiom build should put a copy of
   noweb.sty someplace standard like this:

   mkdir /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/noweb
   cp $AXIOM/bin/tex/noweb.sty /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/noweb
   /usr/bin/texhash

5) How can I exit cleanly from the run-axiom-ui.sh process?
   Perhaps it should catch the ^C and kill signals and do
   something nice.

6) On linux at least maybe we should setup an inetd service to
   start run-axiom-ui.sh automatically on port 5050 so that this
   is transparent to the user? Can you think of any other way
   that we can make it unnecessary for the user to start two
   processes? Should run-axiom-ui start the browser session for
   the user?

7) Of course since this is 'alpha' version there are many easy
   to find problems with output. The graphics output seems
   especially fragile. The examples you give work fine but if
   one deviates slightly it is possible to produce a mess.
   E.g.

     draw(1/sin(x),x=0..2*%pi)

Perhaps I should set up some AxiomUI categories on IssueTracker to
help keep track of these problems?

Now that SOC is over, what is the best way for us to ensure that
the project development continues? Will you be able to continue to
be involved? If so, would to be willing to continue to take the
lead?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Changes http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/202AxiomTutorialPDFOnWindowsBitmapFontsUsed/diff
--
The Axiom Tutorial uses bitmap fonts, as LaTeX does by default when exporting to PDF. 

This means the PDF looks horrible on screen, and is probably larger than it needs to be.

I have the machinery to do this and it's a waste of Kai's time.
The details of final integration are extremely time consuming and

Hi all,

you should check this list's history. This has been discussed before
(look for "-I/usr/include/sys on MacOS X" as the thread title).

I used to try to compile Axiom on OSX, but unfortunately lack the time
to do it now. I can send you my modified source if you wish (although
it is from a 3 or 4 months old check out)


Hope that helps,

Pierre

It's good to hear that.

I know. I was hoping to do this better, but Make is a complicated
beast and I haven't used it in years. When I saw the deadline flying
past I just stopped working on it.

I usually do not to set the executable flag for shell scripts of this
kind. Since the directory where run-axiom-ui.sh resides is not in my
path anyway, I'd have to use ./run-axiom-ui, which isn't better than
sh run-axiom-ui.sh. But I really don't mind, so I'll change it.

True, that was the evil deadline again. I'll fix that.

Press Ctrl-C once (or maybe twice should drop you to the debugger. If
you just want to quit you can press Ctrl-D twice. I agree that this
isn't very user-friendly and I'll fix it.

I'm not sure what the best way is to do this. Maybe a shell script
that starts the web-gui as well as the browser is the way to go. So
far I didn't bother with this since the web-gui is not ready for
end-users anyway. And developers might actually hate it if
run-axiom-ui.sh always starts a browser automatically, since they
might want to start a different browser each time or use other tools
like netcat to connect to the web-gui. I'll add a second shell script,
so that there is one for developers and one for users.

The problem here is that Axiom prints denormalized (?) floats, which
leads to a floating point underflow on the Clisp side. The easy way to
fix this is to use Clisp's long floats (which allow a much greater
range than IEEE double float), but since in the future other GUIs in
other languages might get written, it's probably better to treat this
problem on the Axiom side. I'll look into this, but I'll need some
time. 

> Perhaps I should set up some AxiomUI categories on IssueTracker to

I think it's a bit too early for that. Right now there are so many
problems that writing them all down wouldn't do much good. I don't
intend to abandon this project, so if there is a bug, just send me an
email.

Yes, of course. I'm currently thinking about what the best way is to
proceed. There are quite a few things about the web-gui that I don't
like very much, which I did to meet the SoC deadline. Now that the SoC
is over, I hope to correct these problems.

There is only one real problem right now. As you know my own Linux box
died during the Summer of Code and I'll have to give the replacement
back at the end of this week. Then I'll have to leave town for a
week. After that I'll probably put some effort into the OS X port,
unless I manage to get my hands on another Linux box. We'll see.

Thanks for the patch,
Kai

There are several Axiom Tutorials. See

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomInterface

There is also the Axiom Tutorial that is distributed with the
Windows binary. See link under Start/Axiom

All of these look fine on my system. I am using Acrobat Reader

Older versions of Acrobat did not display all fonts properly.

*,

I've brought savannah (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom)
and sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/axiom) sources up
to the latest level (--patch-45) which includes Peter's Aldor code
patches (although not the full aldor integration).

I'm now compiling the sources on various platforms to update the
binaries.

Emil, et. al.

For the past two years I've been building the proceedings CD that gets
distributed at ISSAC. This has been interesting but not really breaking
any new ground. And the process starts at the last minute so there is
very little time to do anything but get the CD assembled.

This year I'd like to consider something more interesting and to do that
I need to start much earlier (now).

Consider the following idea:

  You are giving a talk about a new algorithm. During the talk you give
  out the URL which contains a copy of your paper. The paper is a literate
  program which contains latex plus the full source code.

  A person in the audience can put a special Live CD in their laptop (which
  boots linux but does not change their hard drive). They open a browser.
  They surf to the given URL. They "drag and drop" your paper onto their
  machine, it compiles, installs, and is set up to run.

  Now the person in the audience can actually execute your algorithm while
  you are giving your talk.

  This is the "Doyen" idea. It can be applied in all of the science
  conferences but ISSAC is a perfect test case.

For background some of you need to know that Carlo Traverso has been trying
to develop an "Active Journal" which would accept "Literate Programs" for
publication.

Literate programs (my definition) are papers that contain the complete,
runnable source code for the published algorithm as well as things like
proof of termination, order of the algorithm, etc. If these are published
in an Active Journal then people will be able to use the algorithms directly.
This has been a problem in the past (e.g. a new, faster Groebner basis
algorithm that does not have associated code). Given that we are doing
computational mathematics I claim that running code is as important as
a proof. Axiom has been rewritten to be all literate programs (that is,
all of the files are now documents and there is no lisp, boot, spac, C, or
Makefile files anymore).

Another effort is the Doyen Computational Science Platform CD project 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/doyencd)
which has created a Live CD (that is, one that will boot linux on a
computer from the CD without changing your hard drive). The goal of
the Doyen project is to set up a Live CD that contains several computer
algebra systems, a web server, a browser, and a special Wiki, a website
user's can change. Thanks to Bill Page Axiom already has such a wiki
(http://page.axiom-developer.org) 

You should be able to "drag and drop" a literate program onto a Doyen
CD and have it automatically compile, install, latex, and set up to run
the program in the paper. Doyen is not quite there yet but that is the
goal.

If we can create a working demonstration of a Doyen CD for the next
ISSAC then we can encourage people to write algorithms that will work
on the CD software and publish the resulting literate programs in 
Carlo's Active Journal.

All of this technology exists in prototype form. ISSAC would be the 
perfect forum to demonstrate a working prototype and it would certainly
make the ISSAC CDs much more than just an electronic copy of a paper
journal. If this works then the ACM can spread the technology to the
other computational science areas.

Comments?

Camm,

If I do 

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

then Axiom builds on FC4

Well, we'll see - it's way more of a challenge that I thought it would be

OK.  The concept of an "Information" dimension, (i.e. whatever underlies the 
concept of bytes as a unit) convinced me of that.  Neither SI nor the seven 
physical Basic Dimensions are sufficient.

Oh, I think I get it - you're discussing the case where the user does the 
following:

a)  assign a variable (call it "x") not only a specific dimension but also a 
specific unit.  (I expect this to be somewhat unusual but it should be 
legal.)
b)  either the unit assigned was different from the current global, or the 
current global is changed.  Now when "x" is evaluated that unit must be 
converted.
c)  we want to show that conversion descriptively (or have the option to).  
Agree.

What I was thinking about was probably setDim("Length", x).  My mistake - you 
were thinking further ahead than I was.

I think I've got it - so there are three levels:

a)  change properties within a single expression, don't change global settings
b)  change global settings for one dimension, but not for other dimensions 
building off of this one
c)  change global settings for ALL dimensions using this dimension - e.g. the 
default rendering for force would become kg*cm/s^2 if 
setUnitAll("Length","cm") were used.

So let's say I define some examples (sorry, I'm not up enough on Axiom syntax 
yet to use it for this) would this be roughly how things would work?:

a::Length
b::Length
c::Force
setDimUnit("Length","cm",a)
setUnit("Length","m")
setUnit("Force"", "N")

-> a
                     a  cm                [Length]
-> b
                     b  m                  [Length]
-> c
                     c  N                  [Force]

setUnitAll("Length","km")

-> a
                     a cm2km  km        [Length]  (or would this stay as cm?)
-> b
                     b m2km  km         [Length]
-> c
                     c m2km  kg km / s^2     [Force]  (with better formatting)

setUnitAll("Time", "millisecond")

-> c
              c m2km s2ms^-2  kg km / ms^2     [Force]

I think I would vote for retroactively setting all non-derived unit using 
instances, with perhaps another command to make this change without updating 
previous instances.  (How about setUnit is retroactive and changeUnit is from 
this point forward?)

Not quite - N is force.  That was a mistake on my part - I meant something 
like setUnits(g,N,inches).  The above should have (and does, in Maxima) 
return an error.

Yes, I understand your scheme better now.

In Maxima, I think this works as a global setting (retroactive) of all 
non-derived instances of a dimension to a new length - essentially the same 
as doing 

setUnit("Mass","g")
setUnit("Force","N")
setUnit("Length","Inches")

but letting Axiom figure out that g is a unit of Mass, N is a unit of Force, 
and Inches is a unit of Length.

Typing error ;-).  I meant to set the unit of three different dimensions.

The line meant I was sleep deprived ;-)  Hopefully round two makes more sense.  
The potential to report a single quantity in a list of different units, one 
converted quantity to a list entry is interesting but not really what I was 
after.

I agree - I would like to have a "strict" mode available which compels the

Uh, nevermind.  I didn't understand your proposal as thoroughly as I needed 
to.  I meant to say one could say something like setUnit("SI/cm") or 
setUnit("SI->cm")  or whatever makes sense.

Yes, I think we might want to do something like that - it would allow (or 
would it?) the possibility of a UnitConversion category with domains for 
PhysicalUnits, ComputerUnits, EconomicUnits, etc.

I agree.  I'm really curious to see if something like this ever gets used in 
such an application :-).

How about we allow the mapping to go through when it IS unique, and return an 
error or ask a question if it isn't (something like provide a list of 
options, and ask the user to select one)?  (Maxima has the ability to ask 
questions of the user if it needs to - it makes some problems MUCH easier to 
solve.)  This is helpful and friendly to the user while still being fully 
correct.

Woo boy.  That's going to be a challenge to report - direction of length 
vector as a factor in results.  Actually, that's an interesting question - 
two length vectors may have different components, but the same magnitude.  
Does the unit meter represent merely the magnitude, or the vector information 
as well?  How do we represent vector information if we want to preserve it 
through the process of reducing dimensions?  The Work vs. Moment example 
would seem to argue that vector information and Dimensions can't really be 
separated, but I don't really know if I'm interperting that right.

Actually, that was more my idea - have the saveUnitSystem command pick out all 
the most recent inputs that set the UnitSystem environment, and save them to 
a file.  The trouble is to pick out such commands, which was why I thought it 
might be simpler just to diff the "current" environment from the "default" 
environment and autogenerate the minimum set of commands to get from a to b.

Right.  Reserving some would be worse than none, because it would be

If we were talking about a normal computer language, I agree.  However, in 
normal scientific usage, proper definition and use of equations should NOT 
use SI abbreviations as variables.  Doing so creates far too much potential 
for misinterpreting said variables later on.  I grant that your proposed 
system has a far better chance than any I have ever seen or heard of of 
making this workable, by being able to separate out m the variable and m the 
unit in the output even if they look the same to the human eye - e.g.:

(1)-> 3*setUnit("Length","m","m")
       
                                          3m m
                                                                     [Length]

If this can actually function, then I am for it because it would be a 
virtually ideal solution, and it is more general in case other, non-physical 
unit cases need that generality.

Well, I might answer "encouraging correct and best practices" but that's only 
a good argument for defaults and utilities, not coding in limitations.

I'm beginning to see how this might work - visually speaking though, it hinges 
on the robustness of Axiom's separating units and non-units in output.  I 
think Axiom might be able to do this in a way most other systems couldn't (at 
least not without a lot more work).

Or whatever is easiest/best.  I don't know offhand that hash tables are.

Perhaps not as bad as I originally thought, but the documentation for use will 
be critically important.  Perhaps that is an argument to continue work on the 
much less correct but perhaps friendlier in the short term Maxima units 
package, which I see now is focused exclusively on Physical Units.

Sounds good. How about as good setups are created we merge them into Axiom?  
Perhaps Axiom will become the central repository for advanced unit 
interaction rules, as people build off of the (hopefully) sound foundation of 
Axiom?

Without doubt scientific units will be the most useful in the short term.  
Building scientific symbolic computing on top of Axiom is going to require, 
as near as I can tell, three things:

a)  the concepts of Dimensions and Units (underway)
b)  Significant Digits, Uncertainty in Measurement, and Error propagation 
(hard, both in itself and also since potential errors due to the numerical 
calculations of the computer must also be considered in order to be rigorous)
c)  Domains of significance.  I don't know what else to call this, but as an 
illustration, we know that Newton's laws of motion break down near the speed 
of light.  Science generally gets on with life by neglecting Einstein type 
effects at velocities which are low compared to c, since any possible 
contribution due to those effects is washed out and below any significant 
level of measurement possible.  So, let's say we input the fully general 
equations into Axiom for motion, velocity, etc. since we like generality.  
However, for sufficiently small velocities (or more correctly, sufficiently 
imprecise) measurements, we want to use Newton's equations, even 
symbolically.  They should (and do) simplify in the limit, and we want Axiom 
to be able to understand or even figure out such things on request, since 
such information is very useful to practical work.  Plus, it would be an 
awesome way to build intuition on when things matter.  The problem is, there 
would need to be a definition given for sufficiently imprecise.  Either 
deduced from supplied measurement uncertainties (and it should deduce them if 
it can since the human probably can't be relied on for this) or supplied in 
purely symbolic situations.  I have no idea how  to express this idea in 
Axiom, if it can even be done, but it would provide an absolutely incredible 
and powerful tool for using the right  equation given the data.

OK, enough pie in the sky talk :-)  Night all, and thanks William as always 
for your patient, helpful and amazingly powerful ideas and thoughts.  I hope 
mine aren't being too tiresome - I think I'm finally beginning to see the 
light, although I'm afraid we might have a bit more than three set* commands 
when we get done.  (Derived Dimension simplification rules in SI will require 
a few more commands, based on my Maxima experience, and that didn't have 
anywhere near the flexibility this will have.)

s does not have to be a symbol, it may be an expression involving several
symbols even though that maybe a bit "dangerous" and unusual. This allows the
user who knows what he is doing to use what is known as an aggregate variable.
Aggregate variables are used to simplify the number of variables in an equation
and often very useful to understanding the interdependencies of variables,
reducing the equation into a dimensionless form, or to a linear relationship
between two aggregate variables. However, not all aggregate variables are
dimensionless. The ideal gas law is such an (simple) example: PV/T = constant;
so PV/T is an aggregate variable. The ideal gas law can also be put into the
form PV = cT, where c is the constant. Using PV as an aggregate variable, it is
proportional to T (and how coincidental, of reduced dimension Force*Length again
and unit for example, liter-atm, and the constant c is not dimensionless.)

Your example below is basically the correct scenario. The syntax and output need
some changes, given next. I added sequence numbers.

> a::Length
> b::Length
> c::Force

Since Length, Force, etc are not domains in my proposed setup, you cannot use
the coercion symbol ::. Assuming you started with SI, you would have to replace
the above three lines by:

->(1) ua:=setDim("Length",a)

       a [m]

Note that the unit is output using a pair of brackets, to avoid confusing it
with a variable m, perhaps. Also, the type of ua is now SIUnitSystem(S), if the
type of a is S.
  
->(2) ub:= setDim("Length", b)

       b [m]

->(3) uc:= setDim("Force",c)

       c [kg-m/s^2]  or [N]

> (4) setDimUnit("Length","cm", a)

This would have the following output:

      a [cm]

Note that no conversion factor is used, since the expression a is entered
afresh. The two identifiers a and ua are of different types. This suggests that
we should add a new signature:

     setDimUnit:(Dimension, Unit, %) -> %

so that 

-> (4)' ua:=setDimUnit("Length","cm",ua)

        a m2cm [cm]

> (5) setUnit("Length","m")

This would set all declared expressions of dimension Length to use [m] as unit.
Whether this is done retroactively or not is a design issue. We can provide both
options with an added parameter.
   
> (6) setUnit("Force"", "N")

Same, all expression of dimension Force use N as unit.

> 
> -> (7) a
>                      a  cm                [Length]

No: The use of 'a' will only return 'a', not 'a' with a unit. To get the unit,
you have to use:

-> (7)' ua

Assuming the setUnit does not change expressions already declared when (5) is
run, then

       a m2cm [cm]  (same as (4)') assuming (4)' is run instead of (4).

Assuming the setUnit changes expressions retroactively when (5) is run, then

       a m2cm cm2m [m], or smarter: a [m] (again, if (4)' is run)

> -> (8)  b
>                      b  m                  [Length]

No: Same as (7): would return just b, without unit.

-> (8)' ub

                   b [m]

since (5) does not affect ub no matter what the design is.

> -> (9) c
>                      c  N                  [Force]

No: Same as (7), will return c without unit.

-> (9)' uc
                 c [N]

since (6) has no effect on uc.
 
> (10) setUnitAll("Length","km")

This will affect all dimensions involving Length as a component. Whether this
will apply to expressions retroactively or not is a design issue. We can provide
both options with an added parameter.
 
> -> (11) a
>                      a cm2km  km        [Length]  (or would this stay as cm?)

-> (11)' ua

The expression a was in [cm] or [m] depending on design (see (7)). Assuming you
meant ua instead of 'a' in (11), your output assumes that no retroactive update
in (5) but retroactive update in (10). There are four possibilities already.


> -> (12) b
>                      b m2km  km         [Length]

(12)' ub
                       b m2km [km]

Assume you meant (11)'. Your answer assumes the unit of b is retroactively
updated to [km] when (10) ran.
Otherwise, the Interpreter has no reason to call the unit system package.

> -> (13) c
>                      c m2km  kg km / s^2     [Force]  (with better formatting)

-> (13)' uc
                      c m2km [kg.km/s^2]

This also assumes the unit of c is retroactively updated in (10).

-> (15)' uc
                c m2km s2ms^(-2)  [kg.km/ms^2]

Assuming (13)' and the unit of c is retroactively updated in (14).

Trouble is, neither the word "change" nor "set" provides a definite meaning. So
I think it is better that setUnit or setUnitAll will change all instances
retroactively.  As I already warned, just like when the unit of a single
expression is changed (the setDimUnit, either version), the other alternative,
changing only future instances will give rise to mixed units and a subsequent
computation involving mixed units must be brought to a common unit system. What
would be the unit of the result? I suppose the only meaningful unit is to the
system's unit in the state vector. Thus, by making changes retroactively at the
time a setUnit or setUnitAll is run, we bring the system back to uniformity
earlier and hence subsequent computations are more efficient. Lazy evaluation
does not pay if there are lots of subsequent computations, requiring conversion
for each quantity involved, and with no place to hold the changes.

I see, you want to set the units for multiple dimensions in one statement. We
can do that easily by allowing:

    setUnits: (List Dimension, List Unit) -> Null (or state-vector)

By "us" you meant "USA"? I always remind my students the probe crashed on Mars
was due to mixing up (or unaware of the mix up) units. I don't think user would
mind including the dimension when setting units. It does help prevent typos from
passing through.

That is the idea. However, there is some technical difficulty that I do not yet
know how to solve, but I think it is doable:

    UnitConversion(dim:List String, unit:List String):Category == ...

Trick is to convert dim and unit into arguments for the constructor Union so we
can form

    Dimension:=Union(dim)  -- right now, syntax error
    Unit:=Union(unit)

There must be a function in Axiom to do that. I just don't know. Here Union is
expecting a tuple of domains. In Union("Mass", ...), the strings are magically
turned into domains.

As long as they are doing only number crunching, they won't need it. But if they
have to solve for the optimal re-stock inventory strategy to minimize cost or
maximize profits, they may need symbolic computation.

To a certain extent, that can be done. We discussed that already. However, Axiom
does not seem to have the ability to ask questions of the user as far as I know.
The graphics package allows mouse selection and controlling using the mouse, so
I suppose that is a form of asking user input. But the Interpreter interface
does not even support the mouse. (Anyone wants to pick up this challenge?)

The Length units are scalar units. Magnitudes are not necessarily length but
they are also scalars. Vectors are given by its scalar components. Directions
are given by unit vectors, usually in terms of directional cosines.
There are formulae in standard coordinate geometry texts to compute projections
of a vector in any direction (by using the dot product).

That is right. Well, like it or not, physicists use lots of vectors and a unit
system should really support vectors. This can be done componentwise, but the
system has to be aware of how to obtain derived units when vector calculus is
applied! With symbolic computation, we can talk about vector functions,
differentiation, integration, etc and all these computations change the units
and dimensions.

The proposal allows a UnitSystem to be parametrized by a set S, and this set S
can be a set of vectors or vector functions. So when coding say SI(S), for
arbitrary S, one has to do cases when S has Vector, etc. Hehe, may be you can
get a ph d for this project!

Well, the setUnit and setUnitAll commands can be tracked by the UnitSystem
domain, and hence all it takes is to report the state-vector at the end of the
session, or just to save the state-vector and reload it in the next session. Not
a big deal.

That is true, but we are talking about computing. In normal scientific use, most
symbolic derivations or equations do not use units. The symbols do carry units
occasionally, but equations never include units. An equation is always an
equality for values, and homogeneous in dimension (which is not stated
explicitly). So the chance of seeing something like m m (for m meter) is small.

This works, if you give the right syntax:

-> (1)'    3*setUnit("Length","m",m)

                  3m [m]

Yes, that is probably much harder than providing arithmetic on strings. Besides,
we only need to provide multiplication and division. But I think it is doable in
Axiom. These local variables are not really visible to the Interpreter user
directly. The user may still have to use setDimUnit, setUnit, etc. The
separation is via the Rep already and the output can turn them into strings. The
problem is they are still symbols and so still restricts the namespace of the
domain, but that is much better than user namespace because the author for the
domain can avoid any potential conflict. The danger is in future updates of the
code;  the person updating may not be careful enough to avoid the reserved names
(like adding some units that turn out to be one of the local variables). Strings
avoid the problem altogether.

I am not a historian. This can't be a new concept, but may or may not have been

This is a totally different domain, involving interval arithmetic, for example.
I don't know what error analysis packages or numerical packages have been
implemented in Axiom. While they are important, I suspect most people are so
used to very high precision computations they ignore to the accuracy of the raw
data.

That what I think it is! I guess such generality will only be useful to those
who work in the area of transition between Newtonian and Quantum (don't even
know if that make sense). Maybe you are dreaming of the grand unification theory
and implementing that in Axiom?

You are welcome. Yes, there will be way more functions specified in the
UnitSystem category. We have discussed the may functions, but there will be
support functions, which are not too hard to implement and can be added quite
naturally.

I look forward to seeing this becoming a reality. It has been quite an
interesting discussion.

The latest Axiom download package is HUGE to be downloaded over a slow dial-up connection. I downloaded it over several days just to realize that much of the material I downloaded was already with me.
The download system could have been even more flexible such as that of the cygwin package. The person who is downloading should have the choice of what he can download instead of compelling him to download everything. For eg, he can downlaod only bin, or bin+doc(dvi or pdf or ps or html as per his requirement). It would have been even better if the users could upgrade the previous versions instead of downloading it afresh (through a system more convinient than the CVS)
By the way don't ignore the people who have MikTex installed on there systems.

It occurs to me that it might be quite appropriate to use
Aldor itself to write the dependency generation program.
Can you see any impediment to my doing this?

Hello *,

I am trying to add various things to axiom which are useful for
the TeXmacs interface, but can be also useful for other purposes
(interfaces with other external programs, for example).

But I have a lot of questions (naturally). First, when I edit some
.boot.pamphlet file(s) in src/interp and say
make
this file is compiled, but AXIOMsys is not re-generated. Is this
due to the .PRECIOUS line in the Makefile? How do I re-generate
AXIOMsys after editing a file in src/interp? Simply deleting
AXIOMsys does not help.

Second, I tried to introduce a new output format today. To make
things simpler, I started from introducing LatexFormat, which is
nearly identical to the TexFormat, but which can be tweaked to
produce modern LaTeX2e rather than plain TeX. Here are the steps
I did:

1. cp tex.spad.pamphlet latex.spad.pamphlet
and edited it to what I want. It introduces a domain LatexFormat
and a package LatexFormat1.

2. in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet, I added ${OUT}/LATEX1.o to
LAYER4 (because TEX1.o is there) and ${OUT}/LATEX.o to LAYER14
(because TEX.o is there), and added the line
latex.spad.pamphlet (LATEX)
to the list of completed spad files at layer 14. I inserted
${OUTSRC}latex.spad into SPADFILES and ${DOC}/latex.spad.dvi
into DOCFILES.

3. in src/algebra/exposed.lsp.pamphlet, I inserted the lines
  (|LatexFormat| . LATEX)
  (|LatexFormat1| . LATEX1)

4. in src/doc/axiom.bib.pamphlet, I inserted a subsection about
latex.spad.

5. in src/interp/setvars.boot.pamphlet, I inserted a new section
about LaTeX format, by copying the TeX format stuff and editing.

6. I copied setvars.boot.pamphlet into a separate directory,
notangle setvars.boot.pamphlet > setvars.boot
started depsys and said
(boottran::boottocl "setvars.boot")
(bye)
Then I copied the generated int/interp/setvars.clisp into
setvars.boot.pamphlet instead of the lisp piece in
<<setvars.clisp>>

7. in src/interp/setvart.boot.pamphlet, I inserted the line
latex       create output in LaTeX style             Off:CONSOLE 
in the table near the beginning, the line
<<outputlatex>>
in the code chunk <<output>>, and the subsection latex
obtained from tex by copying and editing.

Has I missed anything?

After all that, I said
make
It failed:

My next action was
make clean
make
(to be sure that there's no incompatibility with some file
from the normal axiom build). The result is the same.

What can I do next?

In the course of doing all this, I found and corrected a number
of typos in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet, src/interp/setvars.boot.pamphlet
and src/interp/setvart.boot.pamphlet . It seems that the stuff about
OpenMath was produced by copying the TeX stuff (just like I'm doing now!),
and was not edited carefully enough. These changes should be incorporated
into the mainline axiom:

Actually the files in the src/interp directory go into building
obj/bin/interpsys, not AXIOMsys. AXIOMsys is created as a final
copy operation and is not a precondition on any make stanzas 
(although I guess it should be. I'll make a note about it).

Hard to say, really. So much depends on so much.

In your console log it is not clear what failed. Part of the startup
process is to initialize the various )set commands from setvart.boot
If one of these is wrong the process could blow up.

At best I can suggest that you do a diff -r --brief between the
original axiom--main--1--patch-45 sources and your sources so I 
can see what actually changed. That way I can try to reproduce it
here.

re: typos.

I'll apply the changes you sent.

Bill,

Good catch. You think I'd have learned to read by now.

I've pushed the sept release out to savannah and sourceforge
including sources and binaries for Redhat7.3, Redhat9, and FC4.

Bill,

Good catch. You think I'd have learned to read by now.

I've pushed the sept release out to savannah and sourceforge
including sources and binaries for Redhat7.3, Redhat9, and FC4.

OK.  That sounds very interesting and may have possibilities for dimensional 
analysis tools like finding dimensionless constants.  (I need to re-read 
Barton Willis's docs for his Maxima package to remember what features he 
added.

I'm afraid I don't quite understand this part.  Why is ua needed?  I wanted to 
assign a dimension of Length to a, such that typing in a results in the 
following:

->(1) setDim("Length",a)

           a [m]

->(2)  a

           a [m]

Is this not possible, or did I miss another subtle design issue? (probable)

Makes sense, except again I don't follow the need for ua.  Intuitively I want 
to be working with a, and ua is unnecessary - what purpose is it serving?  I 
can see setDimUnit refusing to work on an actual number (e.g. setDimUnit 
("Length,"cm",4) ) without being assigned to a variable, but surely this 
restriction shouldn't apply in general?

I think your arguments for it being retroactive are compelling.

Same question as to why ua is needed.  Also, are you quoting ua, i.e.  ' ua?  
Or is that my mail client?

Sorry if I got sloppy.  retroactive makes sense to me.

Well, my guess is they will mind, but I agree they should do it.  I just hope 
the decision to enforce this rule doesn't make people decide to use Maple or 
some other package (on such small things do decisions hang, sometimes :-/). 
So be it - we'll go for enforced dimension awareness.

Hmm.  I'll add my voice asking for this option/feature - it made Maxima many 
times easier to use on a variety of problems (in Maxima, for example, the 
integration routines would ask the user if things were positive, negative, or 
zero in order to limit the amount of work and provide a unique answer.  I  
wish I could remember the example that I wound up using in Solid State 
Physics once.)

OK.  So in theory, if we vectorize the Units/Derived Dimensions, we won't need

Heh - that'd be cool, but for that I'd have to be enrolled somewhere and 
actually be a student again, and I doubt I'd ever get this across as a thesis 
topic :-).  Dunno where I'd get funding from :-/.  Sure would be interesting

I suppose - but I'm not sure what the use of this will be - scientific 
computing, or more traditional "working on problems in a notebook" style 
stuff.  I'd like to be able to do the latter as well as the former, and in 
the latter the convention would be to avoid using SI units for variables.  Oh 
well, I think it's pretty much covered.

OK.  Any introductory tutorial on units in Axiom will need to make it clear 
that units are not normal variables, and explain how things work, but I think 
it should be doable.

Well, underway in design phase anyway - I'm still getting a handle on your 
design ideas, it seems :-/.  Hopefully my skull will prove to be of finite

Not in proper scientific measurement and data analysis.  It is a totally 
different domain from units, but it is one of the foundations of experimental 
science and will be needed for any intelligent handling of results from 
experiments.  In introductory physics labs (at least the ones I helped teach) 
the two first concepts people are introduced to are units and errors (and I 
might add, they are the most common areas where points are lost in subsequent 
labs :-/).  Any definition of physical constants (which have to be measured, 
after all) will require incorporating information about the accuracy of the 
measurement of the constant, to preserve the full meaning and utility of the 
definition.

Error Analysis is something I have been told cannot be automated, and I accept 
that to a point, but only to a point.  Fundamentally, if it is a 
deterministic and reproducible process to find the real uncertainty on a 
calculation, given enough information about the system in question it has to 
be something that can be reduced to a set of routines.  It might mean that 
the user will need to supply more information about the system to the 
computer than they usually think about explicitly, but it's like being forced 
to define dimensions for all units - if the user doesn't know it, they don't 
know enough to be sure of using it properly, and correct application can (and 
often is, I suspect) a matter of not happening to violate assumptions being 
made unknowingly.

Since this is separate from Units it can come later, but I regard it as 
fundamental for establishing a truly robust basis for scientific computation 
in Axiom.  Indeed, in some sense Axiom might ultimately provide a bridge 
between pure mathematics and the physical sciences, making explicit the 
mathematical tools and assumptions used to "get the job done" in the 
mathematics of physics, chemistry, etc.

Not a bad idea, actually :-).  But, for instance, what IS the definition of 
the "transition region" between Newtonian and Einsteinian behavior in 
descriptions of velocity?  How do you know when you should be using one and 
not the other?  For some cases it is easy, but in the intermediate range it 
is not so simple.  There are borderline cases where uncertainty in 
measurement and relativistic effects are the same order of magnitude, 
although admittedly offhand I don't know how many experimental systems are in 
that range.  These are the types of questions I would sometimes ask myself in 
Physics classes - I would like to have a system that kept track of such 
issues automatically for me when I was doing "real work."  Not that I do much 
of that in physics these days, of course...

I would like to ultimately use a proper Units, Uncertainty, and Error Analysis 
system in Axiom to begin building scientific mathematics on top of it.  Maybe 
it wouldn't be very useful, I don't know.  But, for example, Feyncalc in 
Mathematica is widely used.  I can't help thinking that implementing it in 
Axiom, on top of a Units and Error system which would allow for things like 
plugging in the latest experimental particle accelerator results directly 
into theoretical HEP equations to see if things make sense and are 
significant would be a very exciting and useful tool.  Maybe not though - 
it's been a long time since I was in physics in any significant way.

True.

I'll try and begin structuring the emerging design into some kind of pamphlet 
file, although filling in the code will be a project in and of itself :-/.  
Oh well.  I'll see if some good can come out of all this by remembering all 
of my beginner questions and try to write the pamphlet in a way that 
addresses the reasons for doing things this way and not another, and defining 
concepts I had a hard time with.  If you're interested William I can send you 
a draft before dumping it on the list/wiki, since it is close to certain my 
first attempt will need a lot of tweaking, polishing, and rewriting.

Axiom is a strongly typed language, which means that if you change the
representation of something, it will belong to a different type (or domain). The
two are distinct objects, even if in some sense, they are mathematically the
same. You cannot substitute one for the other without some sort of coercion, if
that is possible at all.

Thus SIUnitSystem(S) is not the same as S, because objects in S has no units
attached (purely mathematical objects, usually). Attaching a unit to an element
s in S immediately takes the result out of the domain S, into the new domain
SIUnitSystem(S). Sure, we can retract the result back to S, but then it will
lose its unit! So if you look at the signature of setDim:

     setDim: (Dimension, S) -> %

The % is SIUnitSystem(S) in our example, in general, it is any domain in
UnitSystem(S) category. Say if s is just a symbol, then the result of
setDim("Length",s) would be an object with Rep

    Record(value = s, dim="Length", unit="m", etc)

whereas the Rep of s in Symbol is simply s itself (probably just a string "s" as
name, or even some hash code). The display s [m] is the display for this new
object. If you do not assign the result to a new variable, say sWithUnit, then
this object is "lost" immediately (although Axiom has a way to recall results in
a session). So one has to assign it to use the new object again. The statment
setDim("Length",s) does not change s at all. It does not add a unit to s. It
creates a new object whose outputform is "s [m]". In fact, you can even assign s
to two different units in the same session, if s happens to just provide the
value for two quantities with different dimensions. So s as an element of S is
dimensionless, and only gain dimensionality via the setDim command. This is not
that uncommon in the real world. We had the example even with the mathematical
constant %pi, with two dimensions in two equations.

This has nothing to do with whether s is a number or a symbolic expression. The
"ua" is required because of types. Unfortunately, while you can retract "ua"
back to "a" because the value of "ua" is "a", you cannot coerce "a" into "ua".

So we agree on another design issue. Making progress.

The single quote was really a prime; I was simply labeling the command as (7)';
may be I should have used (7').  A quote would have no space between the quote
and the symbol.

In Mathematica, one can set the attribute of a function to be Listable. In
Axiom, one has to explicitly create a new function, but one can use the same
name.

Good, we have fewer and fewer differences.

I left the above in, just hoping someone will know how to do this. It is really
a very simple thing. The information (strings for the dimensions) is in a list.
Why can't we feed this to Union without the list wrapper? Axiom allows commands
in Lisp, and so someone who knows Lisp (Tim, Bill, Camm) should be able to
easily write a line to do that. In Mathematica, one can replace the "Head",
which is "List" for a list, by another function using "Apply", such as
Apply[Plus, {1,2,3}] would produce 1+2+3=6. Surely Axiom can do that too -- but
note Union is not a traditional function, but a domain constructor expecting
domains as arguments.

I think Axiom's design philosophy (one of these) is to have as few (none?)
interaction with the user as possible so that functions can be fed into other
functions for automatic execution. With functions requiring interaction, you
can't do that. Graphics is a big exception, but any graphics done by interactive
manipulation can be done in batch mode as well.

I don't think so. The newly discovered example that PV (Pressure times volume)
also has reduced dimension of energy shows that the problem occurs for scalar
quantities already. But the idea to handle vectors with dimension is still one
worth investigating.

Don't forget the dot product, cross product, gradient, curl !

Looks like the discussions will continue. Tim has the idea of a pamphlet book,
so don't worry about the length.

Funding is a real problem, and you're probably right, who would think unit

[snipped]

I agree totally with your view that scientist should know about uncertaintly in
measurement and be able to do error analysis of any computation they do . But
that is for "scientists" (in the sense of physcial sciences). A lot of
measurement are not of that nature, such as statistical measurements, or
processes that involve a lot of randomness such as economics, or weather, It
would be difficult to carry out every computation with an error range.
THe problem is not the computational error analysis, which can be automated
using techniques in automatic differentiation perhaps (applying chain rule to
propagate the error computations as differentials). The problem is in the
determining the accuracies of the input measurements.

No problem and I'll be glad to help out. In any case, if it is on wiki, it will
get modifiable by readers too!

Nope; should be pretty simple - the choice of java was down to the fact
I'm more familiar with the java type library. 

If no one volunteers, then I might have a quick crack at it at some
point.

Tim,

I like both ideas: a potential journal as well as for the
ISSAC CD.  ACM has the wherewithal to launch a journal like
this, but we'd have to do prototypes like you suggest.
Possible starting points are the ISSAC Proceedings, or
a special issue of either Communications in Computer
Algebra or Transactions on Mathematical Software.

How would you propose to handle submissions that include
a Mathematica or Maple literate program?  Should we ask
commercial vendors to include trial versions?  Or perhaps
we could link this to Manuel Bronstein's idea of a SIGSAM
server running commercial and free computer algebra software
that members could connect to.

How do you think we should start this?  What's the first step?

The idea of a journal accepting software as well as articles
has been around for a while.  I remember when I was at
RISC-Linz over ten years ago, people were talking about getting

The idea to have an interactive installation for Axiom (like Cygwin setup
or like "synaptic":http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic on Debian) is a good one
but implementation would be a lot of work! For one thing, such an installer
would have to know all of the dependencies within the Axiom library so
that one could "pick-and-choose" the mathematical packages (also categories
and domains) that one wishes to use and have the installer include all other
packages on which it depends automatically included.

It would be great to hear from anyone who has any specific ideas about how
to do this.

In the meantime, instead of downloading the binary distribution, perhaps
you might find it more convenient and interesting to build Axiom from
source. The detailed instructions are here: BuildAxiom.

OK, but shouldn't that be a separate issue from what is assumed by Axiom when

OK, but don't we want to take it one step further and have Axiom assume that 
after a setDim("Dimension",s) command is issued when we type s on the input 
line we are referring to the new object with outputform "s [m]" when s is any 
type of  Variable?  If s is a number this doesn't make sense, but intuitively 
when I do setDim("Length",x) I expect that from that point on, unless I do 
unsetDim("x") to explicitly undo the setDim command, when I say "x" I'm 
referring to the object that has both the variable x and the information 
about Dimension.  That's implicit in issuing the setDim command in the first 
place.  In a software design sense I would think that doing otherwise would 
violate the Principle of Least Surprise.  I would rather use some command 
like stripDim("x") to get at the object "x" that doesn't have a dimension 
associated with it if for some reason I want it, because once I so setDim 
command it's assumed (at least by me) that I don't WANT to have x work as an 
object without dimension anymore.  Obviously this doesn't work for 
setDim("Length",4), since 4 is not a variable, but in the case of x it should 
(at least IMHO) work.  Maybe we can flag this behavior so that if a hard core 
Axiom user prefers the behavior which is a consequence of strict interaction 
with a strong type system and doesn't want to special case variable behavior 
Axiom won't do the extra voodoo?

If this is not possible, we can probably document things to make them usable, 
but requiring using a second variable to assign dimension to another one is 
(at least based on my own expectations) going to be very, very non-intuitive.  
If x is given a Dimension of Length, x without dimension doesn't have any 
sensical meaning I can figure out.

Right, but that's a constant, and %pi is one of those "dimensionless but not 
without dimension" scenarios, IIRC.  In general I agree - if s is providing 
the value for two quantities with different dimensions, the current setDim 
behavior is good.  But,  *in the specific case of variables*, I still think 
it is a better idea not to require a separate identifier for the x with 
dimension object, since any use of it other than as a variable with dimension 
isn't going to make sense in the context calculations using x and (IMHO) 
shouldn't be allowed.  I would MUCH rather, in that case, that we provide a 
stripDIM(x) command for the presumably much rarer case where you are actually 
looking for that.  Or perhaps an alternative suggestion below, which would 
require (maybe) less violation of Axiom's rules.

This seems a little odd to me - why can't you have a situation where the 
"toplevel" object a refers to a variable "a" and a dimension "dim", and just 
rely on a command to reach the inner variable in the rare case you would want 
to?  A limitation of Axiom?  If so this is very unfortunate, since I suspect 
this is not the only case out there where this kind of thing is going to play 
havoc with the intuitive expectations of users.  What if we internally use 
some symbol other than the one given in setDim("Length",a) and have a rule 
for displaying a variable with dimension that it shouldn't show the internal 
symbol but a instead.  Something like:

setDim("Length",a) -> creates some object containing [nondim_a,Length] and 
assigns this to the name a, just like a := <object> would.  Then we create 
some kind of display rule that rather that variables of the form nondim_* be 
displayed as * in output?  This would preserve the Axiom type behavior while 
hiding the messy details and avoiding violating user expection of variable 
interaction.  This could probably be turned off as well if a hardcore Axiom 
user wants normal behavior.

Maybe I'm making too much of this but I'm still not totally happy about 
enforcing the requirement to always specify a dimension with a unit (although 
I still agree it's the best solution available) - I'd rather avoid any more 
surprises for the user if possible.

Hmm. OK, we can burn that bridge when we come to it if no one tosses up a

Surely this can be made optional?  Current behavior can be preserved, just add 
the ability to ask questions if allowed?

Right.  Actually, for physics it's probably necessary.

I think those can be handled once the basic structure is in place.  At any

<snort>  So did I, when I started thinking about the original Maxima unit 
package a few years ago!  Opps.  Oh, well - maybe the chance to use it for a 
phd will come up if it's already done, and available to show anybody who 
still thinks that ;-).  Easier to fund if all the work's already finished - 
takes less time that way too.

Anything that behaves at all differently from the normal way people use units 
in equations, or would expect things to behave.  Axiom is going to enforce a 
few things most people probably never think about and won't want to think 
about, so we need to coax users in carefully or they'll run screaming.  
(Well, the undergrads will anyway, but there's no help for that...)

Correct.  However, the physical sciences are my primary interest, at this 
point - and they will need it.  Error analysis should be optional, but it is 
a necessary tool for many important kinds of work.

That's up to the scientist - garbage in equals garbage out, even in Axiom.  
However, given good measurements and sufficient information about the system, 
I'm thinking Axiom should be able to take it from there.

Well, I'm trying to avoid abject public humiliation, too ;-)  I'd rather have 
something at least semi-polished for the wiki.

Just a quick answer for now:

You can use

 s:=setDimUnit("Length", "cm",('s)::S)

if s is an unassigned symbol. The quote in the argument tells Axiom to use s as
a symbol temporarily, but then assign it to the domain SIUnitSystem(S) provided
S has RetractableTo(Symbol) such as POLY INT.

So for "variables" (symbols), that is not an issue. For expressions, you need
not assign it to a variable first:

  s:=setDimUnit("Length","cm", P*V)

is quite ok (assuming you want the aggregate variable PV).  In our discussion,
we did not use any specific expression and use "a" to stand for one, so I have
to use a new identifier "ua", assuming "a" is already bound.

I'll respond to other questions later tonight. Got to go to school.

Hmm.  OK.  As a design consideration I would prefer to hide this logic
within the definition of the set functions, but that's just a detail. 
The important thing is it's possible.

Right :-).  I think that use is much less common in practice than using
the same name for the nondim + dimension object and the nondim
variable, but it's good it can be done at need.  (Heck, I never
realized you COULD do something like that - I thought of x [m] as being
inseparable.)

Ah :-).  Opps.  Should have used "t" from the x=x0+v0t+1/2at^2 and time
- that would have been a better example.  My bad.

Sounds good!  I'll start going over the discussions and see if I can
distill it down over the next few days, which probably means a lot more
not-seeing-things-clearly questions :-/.  I've got to think about how
to structure this sucker first, since it is clear there will be
extensions to add for quite some time.

??changed:
-<h3>Editing Axiom's Source Code</h3>
-
-Emacs can be configured to make editing Axiom's source code much easier. First of all you have to put <a href="boot-mode.el"><tt>boot-mode.el</tt></a> and <tt>noweb-mode.el</tt> (included in the noweb distribution, which in turn is included in the Axiom distribution) into your <tt>load-path</tt>. Then you add the following to your <tt>.emacs</tt>:
-
<h3>Editing Pamphlets</h3>

All of Axiom's source files are pamphlets now, which means they
are <a href="http://literateprogramming.com">literate programs</a> as
understood
by <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/">Noweb</a>. This is
a collection of Elisp code and tips to make editing pamphlets with
Emacs less painful.

The first step is to put <tt>noweb-mode.el</tt>, which is contained in
the Noweb distribution, into your <tt>load-path</tt>. Then add the
following to your <tt>.emacs</tt> to load <tt>noweb-mode</tt>:

??changed:
-
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
  '(".*\\.pamphlet" . noweb-mode))
</pre>

Noweb mode not only offers functions to deal with chunks, like killing
chunks, but also lets the user specify a major mode for the code and
documentation chunks. The standard documentation mode is LaTeX and the
standard code mode is Fundamental. While LaTeX is the right choice for
all files in Axiom so far, Fundamental is not a good choice as code
mode in general and there are several ways to change it.

First of all you can use the Emacs command <tt>noweb-set-code-mode</tt>, which
prompts you for a major mode.

You can also
use <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/File-Variables.html">file
variables</a>. The easiest way to do this is to open the file in question, go to the beginning of the file and
call <tt>noweb-insert-mode-line</tt> (a misnomer). It will insert a
new line containing all the necessary incantations. The other option
is to insert the same text manually. A file with code chunks
containing lisp code, for example, should have the following first line:
<pre>
% -*- mode: Noweb; noweb-code-mode: lisp-mode -*-
</pre>

Unfortunately, most files in the Axiom distribution do not contain
file variables to set the code mode and it is unclear if that is
desirable in the first place, since not everyone is using
Emacs. Luckily, many of the pamphlet files have names of the form
<tt>foo.ext.pamphlet</tt>, where <tt>ext</tt> indicates the type of
the code chunks. For example, <tt>foo.lisp.pamphlet</tt> would contain Lisp
code and <tt>bar.spad.pamphlet</tt> would contain spad code. This allows for a
simple form of auto detection. Simply add the following to
your <tt>.emacs</tt>:
<pre>

??changed:
-
</pre>
This code does not override file variables. It uses
the <tt>auto-mode-alist</tt>-mechanism to choose the code mode and
uses Fundamental mode, if that fails.

It should be mentioned that Emacs 22 will feature yet another way to
detect the right major mode for a file by examining the file's
content. Maybe this can be adapted to look at the content of the code
chunks instead.

Especially when dealing with Axiom's existing code base one often
finds oneself in a situation, where a pamphlet looks like this:
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{noweb}

\begin{document}
  \title{DWIM.BOOT.PAMPHLET}
  \author{John Doe}
  \maketitle

<<*>>=
source code
@
</pre>
The pamphlet doesn't contain any documentation and just one big code
  chunk. Usually that means that the original author didn't use
  literate programming and that the source code was just transformed
  to a pamphlet in the obvious - and useless - way. If you want to
  transform it into a true literate program you'll often want to take
  a consecutive region of code, replace it with a chunk marker,
  say <tt>&lt;&lt;foo&gt;&gt;</tt>, and add a new chunk containing
  the replaced code somewhere else in the file. This is made somewhat
  easier by the following two Elisp functions:

<pre>
(defun kai:noweb-extract-chunk (chunk-name start end)
  (interactive "sChunk name: \nr")
  (let* ((chunk (delete-and-extract-region start end)))
    (kill-new (concat "<<" chunk-name ">>=\n" chunk "\n@\n"))
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char start)
      (insert (concat "<<" chunk-name ">>\n"))))
  (noweb-update-chunk-vector))

(defun kai:noweb-yank (&rest args)
  (interactive "")
  (apply 'yank args)
  (noweb-update-chunk-vector))

(add-hook 'noweb-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (global-set-key [(control ?c) ?x] 'kai:noweb-extract-chunk)
	    (global-set-key [(control ?c) ?y] 'kai:noweb-yank)))
</pre>

To use them, just mark a region of code and press <tt>C-c
  x</tt>. You'll be prompted for a chunk name. Then go to the point
  where you want the new chunk to reside and press <tt>C-c y</tt>.

It would be nicer, if one could bind <tt>kai:noweb-yank</tt>
to <tt>C-y</tt> instead. Unfortunately that doesn't work. The problem
seems to be that whenever the Noweb mode changes major modes, because
you left/entered a chunk, the new major mode as well as the Noweb mode
reinstall their key bindings and restore the original binding
for <tt>C-y</tt>. I'm not sure if this explanation is accurate,
though.


<h3>Editing BOOT code</h3>

To simplify editing BOOT code
put <a href="boot-mode.el"><tt>boot-mode.el</tt></a> into
your <tt>load-path</tt> and add the following to
your <tt>.emacs</tt>:
<pre>

??changed:
-
-;; AUTO-MODE-ALIST
-
-(setq auto-mode-alist
-      (list*
-       '(".*\\.pamphlet" . noweb-mode)
-       '(".*\\.boot" . boot-mode)
-       '(".*\\.lisp" . lisp-mode)
-       '(".*\\.c" . c-mode)
-       auto-mode-alist))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
  '(".*\\.boot" . boot-mode))

??changed:
-This code tries to automatically set the code mode in noweb, which only works for files with names of the form <tt>file.ext.pamphlet</tt>, where <tt>ext</tt> indicates the code mode. For example, <tt>sockio.lisp.pamphlet</tt> would have its code mode set to <tt>lisp-mode</tt> and <tt>nci.boot.pamphlet</tt> to <tt>boot-mode</tt>. If the auto-detection can't decide on a mode it uses <tt>fundamental-mode</tt>.
Currently this mode doesn't do anything beyond very rudimentary syntax
high-lighting and making <tt>comment-region</tt> work.

As I show in my earlier reply, we can do setDim("dim",s) but we still need to
assign it to s when s is a Symbol. There is a catch: since there are many
domains that include symbols, it won't be clear where s belongs. In other words,
since there are many setDim functions, one for each domain in the UnitSystem
Category, and each PARAMETER S for UnitSystem, you have to do a package call to
explicitly say which S should contain the symbol. For example, you may want:

   s:=setDim("Length",('s)::S)

or  

   s:=setDim("Length",'s)$SIUnitSystem(S)

In such cases, there is no point in retracting s to S (which will give a symbol
s). In order to make s behave more like it were without units, let's see what
the following scenario will require (assume FPS system)

(1) ->  s:=setDim("Length",4)
              4 [ft]
(2) ->  s:= 7

In order that (2) gives the answer "7 [ft]", the package will have to include a
coercion function that is quite smart: it will need to first coerce 7 to
FPSUnitSystem(PositiveInteger) WITHOUT knowing its dimension, then coerce that
to FPSUnitSystem(S), without knowing the dimension --- which requires S to have
PositiveInteger as a subdomain, then assign whatever property s has (its
dimension and unit at the time) to 7, and finally assigning the fully formed
object (Rep for 7 [ft]) to the identifier s of type FPSUnitSystem(S). Now of
course, the more direct and intuitive way is simply to change the value field in
the Rep for s to 7. But HOW is the Interpreter to know that via a simple,
universally coded assignment?

So to help the Interpreter, or indeed, to avoid having to modify the interpreter
to make it smarter -- such modification will add so much inefficiency to
ordinary assignment that it is not advisable in any case---we can design
functions to do the more intuitive thing:

(2') ->   setValue(s, 7)

but of course this is not as intuitive for the user as (2)! However, it is
actually quite uniform and similar to setDim or setUnit.

The same means that a statement like:

(3) ->  s:= s + 7

would involve the same type of coercions as for (2). If instead,

(3') -> setValue(s, s+7)

then the function setValue *may* be taught to first retract the s in s+7 to S,
add 7 to it in the domain S, then put this in the value-field of Rep of s. I say
*may*, because the general situation would require a parser!

So there is still a big design problem to think about: how to make subsequent
computations intuitive without writing a parser for the package! The following
way perhaps works (effectively asking the user to do the parsing):

    setValue(s, retract(s)+7)

(any implementation, in Axiom, will require conditional implementation, testing
that S can do arithmetic with PositiveInteger or Integer), and if s is not just
a symbol, a retractIfCan(s) may be more appropriate.

You should know that Axiom is full of surprises because it is not easy to
understand the implications of a strongly typed language.

The problem is with subsequent arithmetic (not to mention the grander vector
calculus) that involves quantities whose dimensions or units have not been
defined, whether they be numbers or expressions. In some sense, this is again
forcing the user to know what he is doing, to think of dimensions and units in
every step of the computation. But users used to the sloppy way will find this
very frustrating.  In the simple example above, s+7, the dimension and unit of 7
are not given. Is it good idea to "help" the user and "guess" that 7 should have
the same dimension and unit as s? If so, wouldn't that allow a sloppy user to
add s [ft] to 7 [in] and get (s+7) [ft]? 

I think we should not provide such automation: two reasons: simplifies
implementation, and forces the user to be specific on dimensions and units. So a
user MUST declare, using setDimUnit, EVERY quantity he wants to compute using a
unit system. If all inputs to an expression are declared ahead of time, the
arithmetic will take place in the unit system domain and parsing done by the
Interpreter, without the use of setValue. 

It would be desirable to allow:

    s:= setDimUnit("Length","in",'s)
    t:= s + 7 [ft]

to give a value of s+84 [in] for t. But this involves modifying the interpreter
and the language! ([ft] may be a list containing a variable ft). Here is an
argument for using variables for units, because there would have been created
conversion (rewrite) rule ft == 12 in, which would be applied automatically.

In general, I don't like (personal bias) a program to provide automatic help
(such as checking grammar or spelling or indentations in MS Word!). It is far
better to have fewer options and the system behaves consistently.

I suppose the above is obsolete now?

The pamphlet doesn't contain any documentation and just one big
code chunk. Usually that means that the original author didn't
use literate programming and that the source code was just
transformed to a pamphlet in the obvious - and useless - way. If
you want to transform it into a true literate program you'll
often want to take a consecutive region of code, replace it with
a chunk marker, say '&lt;&lt;foo&gt;&gt;', and add a new chunk
containing the replaced code somewhere else in the file. This is
made somewhat easier by the following two Elisp functions::

  (defun kai:noweb-extract-chunk (chunk-name start end)
    (interactive "sChunk name: \nr")
    (let* ((chunk (delete-and-extract-region start end)))
      (kill-new (concat "<<" chunk-name ">>=\n" chunk "\n@\n"))
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char start)
        (insert (concat "<<" chunk-name ">>\n"))))
    (noweb-update-chunk-vector))

              (global-set-key [(control ?c) ?y] 'kai:noweb-yank)))

To use them, just mark a region of code and press 'C-c x'. You'll
be prompted for a chunk name. Then go to the point where you want
the new chunk to reside and press 'C-c y'.

It would be nicer, if one could bind 'kai:noweb-yank'
to 'C-y' instead. Unfortunately that doesn't work. The problem

I'm not following - are you thinking that we won't know what type "s" is  
inside the object containing both dimension and the nondimensional quantity?  
Well, what about if we had just typed "s" on the input line without saying 
anything about where it belongs? In my copy of Axiom this gives:

   (2)  s
                                                             Type: Variable s

I'm thinking we can assume whatever the "default" assumption would have been 
on the command line - just remember that, bump s temporarily to a symbol, and 
then return it to being a Variable (in this case.)  Or do you mean that s 
will need to wind up in a UnitSystem?  This isn't obvious to me - Dimension 
is more general than any one UnitSystem.  Maybe we need a domain for 
dimension-without-specific-unit objects?

Wait - why do we want s:=7 to work in that case?  I would expect that to fail 
- 7 is a dimensionless number.  For this to work, wouldn't we want either:

s:=setDim("Length",7)    or   w:=setDim("Length",7)
                                             s:=w

I may have misstated the problem.  For the case of numbers, I do not expect 
the above "magical" intuition about a number.  I was referring to the case of 
variables specifically.  Here's the scenario:

I have the equation x(t) := x0+v0*t+1/2*a*t^2 which I want to define with 
dimensional information.  To do this, I need to assign dimensions to each of 
the components in this equation.  What I would LIKE to do is something 
similar to the following:

(1) -> setDim("Length",x0)
(2) -> setDim("Velocity",v0)
(3) -> setDim("Time",t)
(4) -> setDim("Acceleration",a)

Then, if I want to assign 7 meters to x0, I would do the following:

(5) -> x0 := setDimUnit("Length","m",7)

This would do the following:

1.  Create a temporary dimensional object using 7, m, and Length
2.  Verify that m and Length are a legal paring in the temporary object
3.  Check if x0 is associated with a dimension.   If not, proceed to assign it 
the full contents of the temporary dimensional object.  If it does, as in 
this case, check that the dimension of x0 matches the dimension of the 
temporary object.  If it does not, return an error.  If it does, assign the 
x0 dimensional object the specific unit and amount (7).  

Generating plots of dimensional quantities will be interesting, but that's a 
bit down the road at the moment.  Does the above make sense?

I don't think we want the "value" part of a dimension+nondim object to be 
workable as an individual object at all.  Adding 7 to it shouldn't be legal.

I vote for just avoiding the whole situation by not dealing in anything but 
unit/dimensional quantities when dimensions are in play.  It's a bit sad to 
lose the convenience of being able to say s:=7*m but you finally convinced 
me.

Oh, I know :-).  But we've got to try to meet our users at least part way or 
we won't have many users!  We need to stay correct, but what I'm trying to do 
is make things as convenient as possible while remaining correct.

I don't think we want to combine dimension/unit quantities with quantities 
whose dimensions or units have not been defined - are there scenarios where 
this is needed?

No, we shouldn't do that.  That wasn't what I was advocating - sorry if I gave 
that impression.

Right.

I figured this scenario wouldn't work as I began coming to grips with your 
design - I don't think the above is possible, sadly.  It would have to be 
done as follows, given the best setDimUnit definition I can see as being 
workable:

     s:= setDimUnit("Length","in",s)
     t:= s + setDimUnit("Length","ft",7)

This would be legal, but the units of t, unless previously set, would be 
determined in this case by what the global default is.  (Probably meters ;-)

Well, I guess I'm in the middle - I like spell checking, but I don't like 
grammer checking (particularly since grammer checking can't be defined 
programatically, IIRC!).

I think you addressed that problem in the previous email, but we'll see when 
we get to coding :-).

No, I don't think so. So far, everything works even though users will be forced
to declare dimension and unit for each quantity (as we agree below). However,
the above is not the same thing. If a user is comfortable with defaults, that
is, undefined identifiers are of type Symbol (techically, Variable(s) for Symbol
s), and any other operations will be promoted to a higher domain, usually POLY
INT, then that is fine. But if someone wants to work with say S := EXPR INT and
uses SIUNitSystem(S), then he will have to package call the setDimUnit for an
undefined identifier s.  In principle, we do NOT know the type of undefined
identifiers. The Interpreter assumes we are using Symbol. This won't be assumed
in the compiler.

Perfect scenario.

I may think a bit of the last action though: whether we allow an identifier to
change its dimension. Say, what if I decide to "recycle" an identifier? Note
that x0 in (5) has the same TYPE as the rhs BEFORE assignment. It should be
legal, perhaps with a warning message, if the target dimension and unit do not
match those of x0.

Certainly, the setValue function is still needed, but you may not want to export
it. In the example, I was pushing the "convenience" feature you have been
advocating. I am glad you don't want to push that far!

Great. May be a future project is to modify the interpreter to allow s:= 7 [ft]
as syntactic sugar, once the foundation is done, correctly.

A very good ideal.

Yes, that would have made implementation much easier in the conversion part. (I

conversions).

Yes, everything depends on how to coding goes! (especially when it comes to the

Ho boy, this is where my limited understanding of strong typing rears
its ugly head.  I think we need to have sensible defaults for this (I'm
definitly opposed to forcing the user to think about such things unless
they choose to) but I agree we need to allow for more advanced uses. 
Ugh.  That will take some thought.

OK, so we need to explicitly make some assumption in the definition of
the function I guess - so long as it doesn't make its way into require
default user syntax ;-).

Maybe that's where my "unSetDim" idea can come in?  We need a way to
undo what we do, but I don't think we want it to be automatic.

I think I disagree, if I understand you here - one of the primary
benefits I see of having generic dimensions without units associated
with variables is to enforce matching dimensions between assignments
and variables being assigned (this is another check on correctness, and
a useful one IMHO).  For example, if someone solves for a Moment of
Force quantity and tries to assign it to a variable defined to have
dimension Work, on the grounds that they have the same reduced
dimensions, Axiom can (and should, IMHO) stop them cold.  Which also
raises the point that we need to add a way to define a variable such
that it will accept any dimension who's reduced dimensions match,
proceeding on with those reduced dimensions.  Would it be possible (or
rather, interesting and useful) to have the state vector preserve the
history of derived -> reduced conversions?  Sort of a pedigree of where
the given unit/dimension definition came from, conversion wise?

Nope, I know there are limits to convenience :-).  Just want to do the
best I can to ensure this sucker gets used, but if I didn't think
correctness was priority #1 I wouldn't be interested in doing this in
Axiom ;-).  At the user level, setValue should not be an option -
you're right, such actions are needed for manipulation at low levels
INSIDE the package, now that I stop and think about it - but they do
need to be very strictly internal.

That's a very good idea, but definitely lower priority at the moment.

Well, I think the lesson of the commercial Axiom is that you need to
sell correctness and be as friendly as possible about it - otherwise
you starve from lack of users.  Axiom is open source now, of course, so
we don't have the financial problems, but we still need users to remain
(or become) a living, breathing project.  Be correct, but remember the
human side of the equation when possible, too.

Well, Maxima did the same to me ;-).  I guess it's true what they say,
assume you'll have to try to implement something at least once before
you can properly define the problem.

> Yes, everything depends on how to coding goes! (especially when it 
> comes to the compiler). 

Ah, point.  So in general, it is not always useful to try something in
the interpreter as opposed to coding it and compiling it?  In Maxima,
generally speaking, it was all the same - I take it that's not the case
here?  Eeep.

Cheers,
CY

Great!  But presumably this needs doing as root.  The earlier
randomized sbrk had a similar system-wide disabling shell command
using the /proc filesystem if I recall.  But there was also a
per-process user-level syscall, which was used in the 'setarch'
utility and incoporated directly into GCL's main routine, that
accomplished the same thing.  It would be great if we could follow
suit here as well.  The earlier call was a 'personality set'.  Do you
have any idea of an analogous syscall here?

I'll leave that up to you. Enforcing a sticky dimension to an identifier is
similar to enforcing type to an identifier, so it is similating dimensions as
types.

Sure. The problem is not that critical in a line by line interpreter
environment. If an assignment is illegal as above but simply because the user
forgets to unSetDim, he gets an error message and he can easily correct that.
However, if the user is writing s script (.input file), and the running of the
script stops because of such an "error" (which is not an error to the user
because he thinks he is just recycling identifiers), it may cost him a lot of
recomputation time. On the other hand, a warning would alert the user, but
without aborting. (I really hate it when I back up a bunch of files, and one of
them was in use by the OS, and the OS stops; I have no way, except to check file
by file, how to restart or continue.) I think the decision of whether we should
stop or just warn must be weighted by whether our intended users are
knowledgeable experts or amateur beginners (like students). I would opt for
warning, because it helps the advanced users, and at the same time, to an
interactive line by line user, it makes no difference whether the message is
"this is illegal" or "warning: dimension error";  in both cases, he is stopped.

No matter how you try, there is no way to guarantee correct verification of
homogeneity of dimension in an equation or expression. The best we can do is the
guarantee that for reduced dimension because the only algorithm to do the
verification is to reduce all dimensions to the basic dimensions. I had
suggested earlier that the Rep include the reduced dimension to make such
checking more efficient. Then the dimension can be as fancy as the user wants. 

This brings another design issue into sight: Dimension should be a group
(mathematical term) generated by the basic dimensions, but allowing the user to
define arbitrarily any derived units. We need to allow this since a user may
want to call "Mass^2 Time/Length^3" by the name "foo". With the current concept
of the Dimension domain as a Union of Strings, the set of dimensions is fixed
and not extendable to include something not anticipated.

  foo:PhysicalDimension:= Mass^2*Time*Length^(-3)
  setDim(foo, s)

Making Dimension a free abelian group, written multiplicatively, based on some
basic dimensions as generators (these may differ depending on expert area) may
avoid the "Union" problem. We can now easily have a DimensionCategory. A
corresponding UnitsCategory will also be a subcategory of the free abelian group
category (FreeAbelianGroup is a category in Axiom, this will save a lot of
implementation work since all the functions (equality, and reduction, for
example) are built in already! We can have a free abelian group on ANY set. 

We need more discussion on this, on how this affects the functions.

This can be done in the Rep of each quantity with a unit.

Yes, code that work in the interpreter does not work (usually) in the compiler
because the interpreter is "intelligent". However, it is still a good idea to
first use interpreter code to test some implementation of functions. Most of the
problems are you have to tell the compiler where to find the functions
(coercion, package call). All abbreviations must also be defined for the
compiler.

Oh, while I remember - would it workable to adopt the following
notation for reduced dimensions?

Say we have a dimension Force, and when we reduce it we have
Mass*Length/Time^2  (I'd use the work example but I'm running late.) 
Say we want those to be reduced dimensions - can we use this notation
or are Axiom's output forms not that flexible:

Mass[r]*Length[r]/Time[r]^2

I don't know how we want to denote this on units - my thinking at the
moment is that reduced dimensions don't have reduced units, but that's
just off the cuff.

Cheers,
CY

Except in the case of a student, they might just ignore the warning,
accept the overwrite, and proceed with the calculation hoping they can
just ignore the problem and get an answer that "looks" right.

Hmm.  How about this - by default we require an explicit unSetDim, but
we provide a mechanism for advanced users whereby they can read in a
script with the error mechanism reduced to a warning.  An advanced user
will be able to find and use this, and by default we preserve Axiom's
tough-guy rep ;-).

I'm working on an idea or two about expanding that a bit, but basically
it looks like you're right once we substitute for any derived
dimensions.  I'm trying right now to straighten out the rules for such
things in my head via writing them down ;-).

Well, I'll be able to comment better once I know what a free abelian
group is/means, but in general it sounds like it's a good solution.

OK - I'll try and qualify myself - where are the good docs on free

OK, I think this might be useful later on.  Once I get to writing up
the Axiom level represenation of quantities with dimensions/units I'll
try and think some more about this.

Hmm.  OK.

Good for naive users and maybe even for expert users. But just like types are
rigid, sticky dimension will also be rigid. There are users who prefer more
loose settings (that's one reason why Mathematica or Maple is popular).

As long as you know how to do it. Axiom interpreter has three settings. See )set
user. That may provide the switch. I don't know how that works.

Speaking of "substitute", if Dimension is modeled by a free abelian group (maybe
not even free, since it can be factored by using derived dimension definitions
(relations); the more I toyed with this idea, the more promising that looks),
then units can be obtained by a substitution. We may be able to let the rules be
user add-ons. Again, need more thoughts on this.

The reduced dimension would be the default representation in Dimension if it is
modelled by a group. The only way to "recover" or retain the physical dimension
may be in the Rep of the UnitSystem domain itself, for each identifier.

So the group model will provide all the computation to get reduced dimension and
also equality of dimension. The Rep retains both dimension and reduced
dimension.

Well actually, the Mass, etc on the foo definition probably should have been
quoted as strings, but they are NOT strings anymore, but are generators for the
group for the dimension domain.

An abelian group is simply a set with a commutative multiplicative (but usually
written additively) binary operation and every element has a multiplicative
inverse. It is free if there are no relations among the generators. As mentioned
earlier, maybe we should actually allow non-free abelian group to model
Dimension domains. We will need to construct quotient objects in the abelian
group category. Any introductory modern algebra book will have enough coverage
for this project. Or just google.

No [IMHO]. This adds something unconventional and complicates things. There
should be no difference in the output form. It should be quite obvious that a
dimension or unit output is reduced or not. Plus, there are dimensions whose
reduced dimension is identical to the dimension. The user can also explicitly
ask for a reduced dimension through functions such as reduce(identifier).
Reduced dimension can have reduced units (why not)?

You can have some introductory materials=20
in "Elements of Abstract and Linear Algebra" from E.H. Connell

http://www.math.miami.edu/~ec/book/

or Wikipedia.

True, but reduced dimension itself is somewhat unconventional.  We are
dealing with a level of strictness virtually never used in the real
world (at least in my experience) so I'm not surprised normal usage
conventions are breaking down somewhat.  This is actually one of the
things making this so interesting for me :-).  I like getting down to
the roots of things and making it really correct.

Hopefully this could be done with some conditional outputform tweak
based on the Rep, so maybe a system setting to enable or disable this
would be a good idea, assuming I can convince you it's a good idea -
)set ShowReducedDimensions true  or some such.

The reduced dimension flag tells us that these dimensions are the
result of a substitution for some derived dimension, but otherwise we
allow things to proceed as normal - the reduced dimensions of work and
moment of force are the same, even though the derived dimensions
themselves are not.  The implication is that a reduced dimension
differs from a normal dimension in its history, but not in any
functional way, which also implies that its history is somehow
"inherent" in the Rep.  (one of the reasons I am in favor of preserving
the dimensional history of a reduced dimension in its Rep).  Just by
making the distinction, we are stating that there is something about a
reduced dimension compared to a regular dimension that MIGHT matter -
there may be some incompatibility not expressed in the dimensional
representation as it currently exists, although we don't know what. 
Certainly, if I divide work by moment of force, this is a dimensionless
number in terms of reduced dimensions but not in terms of derived
dimensions, and I would be happier if the "dimensionless" number
remembers something about this.  I'll have more details later - I'm
still chewing on this issue.  I might be thinking of reduced dimension
a bit differently than how it was originally defined - I'll have to
look - I'm viewing it as the dimension itself remembering its history,
rather than it being the name for a basic dimension definition of a
derived dimension.  

Hmm, I might be having too much fun thinking about this. Uh oh.

It is obvious in the initial substitution, but what if the resulting
quantity goes on to be used elsewhere, where its history is not
immediately apparent from the environment?

A user can't always ask for a reduced dimension - what would that mean
in the case of basic dimensions?  reduced from where?  from which
derived dimension?  reduced(Length) wouldn't mean anything, but the
Length which is part of the reduced dimension definition of Force is a
reduced dimension.

I'm not sure I agree there are dimensions whose reduced dimension is
identical to the dimension, depending on which definition of reduce we
are using.  I view a reduced dimension as a normal dimension which
calculates as normal, but preserves information about its origins.

I'm working on the interaction rules between reduced, derived, and
normal dimensions, although again I suspect I've gone a tad overboard
with the reduced idea.  Maybe this weekend I'll get some more written
on these thoughts, and realize they make no sense ;-).

> Reduced dimension can have reduced units (why not)?

Because this information is already in the dimension.  A unit might
have either a reduced dimension or a regular dimension associated with
it, depending on its history, but I see no reason to impart that
information to the unit as well since the unit MUST be associated with
a dimension.

Hmm.  Time to regroup and state my ideas on the definitions of reduced.

I think the global )set is the wrong place, since a lot of users are not going
to bother with units (or have no need to use units). If you really like to use a
different but optional notation in output for reduced dimensions, then use a set
command in the package (and even include this in the category specificiation),
remember this in the state vector, and modify the outputform coercions to do
it.  This is different from the )set UnitSystem because one cannot include this
setting in a unit system domain without first choosing the domain, whereas the
reduced dimension flag may be unit-system dependent. (Even for the )set
UnitSystem case, I have also suggested a simpler )library command to replace the
)set command).

You have to define "normal dimension" for me.

It may not be easy to trace what you called "history". My use of reduced
dimension is strictly reducing a derived (or basic, which would be unchanged)
dimension to a product and quotient of basic dimensions (that is where the idea
of using a (free) abelian group written multiplicatively to model Dimension
comes from), where each basic dimension only appears ONCE to some power. 

Let's consider a hypothetical situation where electricity is used to raise a big
steel ball with mass m to a certain height h and then give it a certain velocity
v; assume that energy in the form of electricity can be provided at a rate p for
a period t, we want to compute the excess electricity (as a margin of error)
using the formula:

   E = p*t - m*g*h - 1/2* m*v^2

where p is power in [kw] and t is time in [hr], and the rest are potential
energy and kinetic energy imparted to the ball (neglecting all other loss of
energy due to friction, etc), resulting in an expression for excess electricity
capacity which the user wants to express in [kwh]. This may be accomplished
under the present proposal as:

  E := setDimUnit("Energy", "kwh", p*t - m*g*h - 1/2 * m * v^2)

assuming all the other quantities are assigned their correct dimensions and
units already. In reduced dimension, <Energy> = <Length*Mass^2/Time^2> but for E
(I am starting to use pointed brackets to enclose dimensions IN DOCUMENTATION
rather than the string quote even though they may be represented internally as
strings; what do you think?), this basic dimension expression comes in three
different ways of expressing energy, in terms of derived dimensions such as
<Power>, <Acceleration>, <Velocity> and the basic dimensions <Mass>, <Length>,
<Time>. How would you capture the "history" of E in its Rep? If the unit is to
be automatically set, E may be assigned to have unit [kg m^2/s^2] or [Joule],
but probably not [kwh]. In this case, the equation is homogeneous dimensionally
and correct. However, the user may want the unit to be associated with a derived
dimension [Power*Time]. There is currently no provision to specify a derived
dimension as a product. So we may need to create a new one, say called
<Electricity>. Otherwise, the user's desire can be accommodated by the choice of
unit such as [kwh].

The Rep of E in the example above would be, if it includes the reduced
dimension:

   Record[value=E, dim = "Energy", reducedDim = "Mass*Length^2/Time^2",
          unit = "kwh", etc.]

The dimensionless case is but one instance of the many-to-one (indeed,
many-to-many) mapping of units to dimensions. We can capture (partially) the
nature of a quantity with dimension <Work>/<Moment> with the following Rep:

   Record[value=work/moment, dim="Plane Angle", reducedDim="1", unit = "rad",
etc]

To understand this, think of the moment generated about the pivot when the end
of a lever, of distance ell from the pivot, is rotated through an angle theta
with a force of constant magnitude f, always perpendicular to the lever. The
ratio <Work>/<Moment> may be meaningful; the total moment is computed by the
(scalar) product of the magnitude of the force f, and the distance ell to the
pivot, but the work is computed via an integral of a dot product for vectors,
since the direction of the force is constantly changing along the tangent of an
arc. The force vector is a function of theta, and is given by

    F(theta) = (f sin(theta), f cos(theta))

and the infinitesimal change in position r through which this force acts to
produce work is the vector (where r is the position vector for the point of
application, relative to the pivot as the origin)

    d(r) = (ell sin(theta) d(theta), ell cos(theta) d(theta))

giving the infinitesimal work done as

    F(theta) . d(r) = f*ell d(theta)

so that the total work through an angle theta is

   work = integral(f*ell d(theta)) from 0 to theta
        = f*ell*theta

Hence work/moment =  theta [rad]. (If my analysis above is correct, this
explains in some detail why the two are different.) Since the derived dimension
for <Plane Angle> is actually <Length>/<Length>, the reduced dimension is just
"1", but to say that <Work>/<Moment> is dimensionless is not to recognize the
physical difference between the two. Note moreover, the derived dimension of
<Plane Angle> does not capture the full physical meaning either. A better unit
may be [N-m/N-m] (recall that [m/m] is [rad] too) and unless we create new names
for each of these many-to-many instances (for both dimension and unit), it is
hard to assign derived dimensions. So a more desirable design would be to allow
an expert user to add derived dimensions (and units) on the fly, and using a
Dimension domain constructor with arbitrary set of dimensions may be the way to
do that. By using the idea of a quotient of a free abelian group divided by a
subgroup generated by these new derived dimensions in terms of basic dimensions,
Axiom can handle such generality. The analog would be the idea of polynomial
ideals (which captures relations among variables) and the quotient ring
constructed by dividing a polynomial ring by the ideal. We can construct ideals
on the fly and work with the quotient ring.

I think maintaining a full history may be done in a chain. However, due to the
many to many mapping for units to dimensions (and I am not thinking of
incompatible ones like <Work> and <Moment>, but just say units for <Energy>), it
will take a lot of new names to separately capture history. I still think the
units themselves are sufficient indication of the relation between (derived)
dimension and reduced dimension as far as the user goes. In the system, to be
able to recognize, say [kwh], or more simply [watt-hour] (dropping the prefix
kilo) as a unit of <Energy> requires setting up such a relation. Any
intermediate steps, say how the power p is computed before E is computed in the
example is not something of interest to E, but only of interest to p, and in the
Rep of p, we have that information. So we can keep the history in this chained
fashion, but in each identifier, the "history" is short and immediate.

You have to be more precise than that! What is "normal"? "origin"?

In mathematics, we consider integers as a subset of fractions, and in reducing
all fractions to lowest terms, we also consider that reducing the integer 2 to
lowest terms as reducing the fraction 2/1 to lowest terms. This is so that the
procedure "reduce to lowest terms" is applicable to all fractions, whether the
"origin" of a fraction is actually an integer or not. I think this convention
applies through all subdomains in mathematics and in Axiom. So it should be
perfectly correct to speak of the reduced dimension of a basic dimension in the
sense that the set of basic dimensions is a subset of all derived dimensions.

Please do not keep adding new terms ("regular dimension") without defining it.

I don't follow the precise meaning of "the unit MUST be associated with a
dimension".  Do you mean "For each unit, we must specify a [emphasized]
dimension to which the unit belongs?" I have no quarrel with that. If you meant
"the REDUCED dimension of the unit MUST be unique", I also agree (at least with
MY definition of reduced dimension). If you meant "a unit MUST be associated
with a dimension, but that dimension need not be unique", that would be ok also.
However, if you meant "a unit MUST be associated with a UNIQUE dimension", that
I don't agree. The mapping between dimensions and units is many-to-many, unless
you are determined to create new names for dimensions and units to split the
mapping to force it to be many-to-one, one-to-many or one-to-one (I certainly
don't recommend that, and won't do that).

> Hmm.  Time to regroup and state my ideas on the definitions of reduced.

Precise definitions is the first step, always. Precise statements (even if
long-winded) is the next.

In

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphs

I am trying to define the category of graphs in Aldor.

When I try to use this category in the definition of the
domain of FiniteGraphs I get an unexpected error:

  There are no suitable meanings for the operator `GraphCategory'.

But if I simply include the exported function definitions in
the domain itself then it seems to compile ok.

Since I am really just learning Aldor, this is probably just
a simple error on my part. Can anyone help me understand the
error and how to use categories properly in this case?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi Bill!

I looked at the code, and the only problem I see is that Record wont
satisfy BasicType. IIRC, the primitive structured types in aldor do
not export equality operations, let alone play into the standard
category hierarchy,

You could either write a custom Edge domain satisfying BasicType, else
use a higher-level data type like List or PrimitiveArray.

However, I cant be 100% about this. I do not have aldor installed.

Cheers,
Steve

In the second version, you haven't told the compiler where it can find
the definition of `GraphCategory', so you get an error.

In order to get the library included, you need to put

#library "graphcat.ao" GRAPHCAT;
import from GRAPHCAT;
inline from GRAPHCAT;

at the top of the file (actually, anywhere at top level will do, but it
makes most sense just after #include "axiom.as").

The first line defines a library object referring to your category
definition, the second imports from it.  The third says that the
generated code can depend on the definitions (and not just the
signatures) within GRAPHCAT - it's only required when you want compiled
code to go faster, at the expense of a tighter dependency between
compiled pieces of code.

Obviously, this will get out of hand when you depend on many .ao files.
For this reason you can use 'ar' to create a single library file from
the .ao's which can then be imported as one lump (in fact axiom.as does
just this with libaxiom.al).

Hi,

I checked in  a slightly updated version of AxiomUI, correcting most
of the problems that Bill mentioned. No new functionality, though.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who helped me
with this project during the Summer of Code.

Cheers,
Kai

Did you get a chance to add the Hyperdoc pages and related programs
to the archive?

Great. I added:

#library GRAPHCAT "GRAPHCAT.ao";
import from GRAPHCAT;
inline from GRAPHCAT;

and now it finds the category. I also had to change BasicType to
Type for reasons Steve Wilson described on Sun Sep 11 2005 9:53 AM:

However now in

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphs

I get a different apparently more serious error:

  >> System error:
   AxiomXL file "GRAPHCAT" is missing!

This error occurs when trying to call new()$FiniteGraph(INT) in spite
of having already successfully defined g as a FiniteGraph.

Ideas? Is this a "system error" or just another "user error"?

William,

I don't think that this is a problem. The compiler is able to
easily distinguish the two uses of "source" because of strong
typing. In fact in this case they really are the same, i.e. the
field is the representation of the function so perhaps the usage
is justified.

This works in the spad version:

http://axiom-developer.org/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphsInSPAD

But the equivalent Aldor version of the code (with corrections
by Peter Broadbery and Steve Wilson, not with standing any
remaining errors on my part), gives a >>System error. See:

http://axiom-developer.org/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphs

Sounds good.  There are a fair number of options worth tweaking in a units 
environment, so that mechanism is a good one to nail down early.

Opps - sorry.  "normal dimension" would in this case be a "non-reduced 
dimension," which may not be much more informative.  More on this below.

Hmm - not a bad idea, since interacting with them will be quite different from

I wouldn't capture it in E exactly, except maybe as a consequence of 
incorporating reduced dimensions.  I need to define my terms - I'll try to 
revisit this issue later - it's an excellent example and my point out flaws 
in my thinking to me.

OK (I think.)  Offhand I'm guessing products as derived dimensions aren't the 
best idea?

Except E knows about a specific p, and so (in theory) the user could enquire 
about the history of p that E depends on, correct?  I'm not sure whether it's 
actually useful or not to preserve history - it might not be worth the 
effort.  I'll have to think about it some more, in light of your new 
examples.

Apologies.  Here is how I've been thinking about these terms:

"dimension" or "normal dimension" - a dimension with no historical 
information, which is not the product of a substitution used in calculations.  
Any unit input by the user is a "normal" dimension, as is an dimension which 
passes through calculations without being altered.

"reduced dimension"  - a dimension which is the result of a substitution for 
another dimension.  E.g. if we have <Force> and substitute in 
<Mass>*<Length>/<Time>^2, each of those three dimensions is a "reduced" 
dimension because it was substituted in for a higher order dimension.

Of course, in the Force example the mapping may be unique (don't know offhand) 
in the default SI  definitions, but who's to say a user won't define a custom 
derived dimension with SI base dimensions the same as those of force?  That's 
why I don't want to assume any case where reduced dimensions are identical to 
"normal" dimensions - e.g. their origins can be ignored.  It may be that we 
DO want to ignore their origins, as long as we prevent casual simplification 
from  base dimensions to derived dimensions without explicit user input/rule 
definitions.  In which case "reduced dimensions" would retain no history.  
Needs more thought.

Sorry.  regular dimension = normal dimension or just plain "dimension".

No, a unit doesn't need to be associated with a unique dimension.  Agree with 
that.  I just meant "a unit cannot be defined without an associated 
dimension."  Although strictly speaking, dimensionless things like radians 
might make that invalid.  Hmm...

OK. :-).  I'm working on a (hopefully) precise writeup of my definitions 
(hopefully it will be the first sections of introductory material for the 
eventual units.spad.pamphlet) - once I'm reasonably sure it's ready to be 
shredded I'll post it ;-).  With any luck, once things are reasonably well 
defined we can proceed without too much more trouble to the design issues in 
terms of Axiom :-).

Unfortunately not. There are still some problems with the pages and
since the whole package is a few megabytes in size, I didn't want to
check in a broken version. I'll work on them when I get back next
week.

Dear all,

I was sick last week and it seems that I somehow missed part of the
discussion. Hence two questions:

* is it true, that we have permission to distribute the Aldor source now? (In
  fact, for my part, I don't even have the source...)

* I would like to "announce" Axiom 3 just before October. (without the beta, to
  make it look new) It seems that Tim has prepared binaries, have they been
  tested? In patch 45 or so HyperDoc failed on startup. (due to some strange
  and undocumented edits in util.ht.) Is axiomui in a usable state for the
  windows users?

Martin

The axiom-developer.org virtual machine should be back up and running now.

It was running out of memory and killed or zombied 6k processes.
I upgraded the memory on the machine to 768k.

Thanks Tim! It's working fine now.

One of these days it would be good to find low cost (no cost?)
dedicated home for axiom-developer. Some of the things we are
doing on this machine require a lot of horse power.

Also it sure would be nice if we could find someone willing
to host a mirror site.

Not only on Windows, is it not possible on Linux to download only the packages required and to just build them? 
Also, as a typical case, several users use both Linux and Windows in parallel. If there could be a way to download Linux and Windows specific sources separately from the sources common to both and that the source common to both could be used under both Linux and Windows, that would save lot of download time and money.

Tracing the message "AxiomXL file ..." leads me to 

http://www.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom--main--1/src/interp/daas
e.lisp.pamphlet

;; following 2 functions are called by file-exports and file-imports
macros
(defun foam::process-import-entry (entry)
  (let* ((asharpname (car entry))
	 (stringname (cadr entry))
	 (hcode (caddr entry))
	 (libname (cadddr entry))
	 (bootname (intern stringname 'boot)))
    (declare (ignore libname))
    (if (and (eq hcode 'foam-user::|initializer|) (not (boundp
asharpname)))
	(error (format nil "AxiomXL file ~s is missing!" stringname)))
    (unless (or (not (numberp hcode)) (zerop hcode) (boundp asharpname))
	  (when (|constructor?| bootname)
		(set asharpname
		     (if (getdatabase bootname 'niladic)
			 (|makeLazyOldAxiomDispatchDomain| (list
bootname))
		       (cons '|runOldAxiomFunctor|  bootname))))
	  (when (|attribute?| bootname)
		(set asharpname (|makeLazyOldAxiomDispatchDomain|
bootname))))))

-----------

The 'file-imports' macro is defined here

http://www.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom--main--1/src/interp/foam
_l.lisp.pamphlet

but from this point on I get lost. It is not clear to me where
this macro is called nor why it is being called for "GRAPHCAT".

These files have your name and Stephen M. Watt listed as
authors. I don't suppose you remember what all this was
about 10+ years ago :) or do you?

Any suggestions as to where I should look?

Do we have any working examples of Aldor categories being
used in the old version of Axiom?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Under linux with TeXmacs, the graphics doesn't appear at all. Just the message indicating the type is shown.
I even followed the instructions on the FAQ and changed the AXIOMsys to axiom and even sman. But if I do that though HyperDoc appears, I have to press return several times(may be upto 7 times) before the answer appears on the texmacs interface. Just blank lines with the red axiom prompt keep on appearing.

Unfortunately Axiom does not contain a thorough description of the 
mathematical principles. It does not even contain a good explanation
of category theory or even of the algorithms that it uses. By design
this will change in the future provided people lend their expertise
to the problem. It's clearly a 30 year horizon goal.

OK, so (below) "dimension"="normal dimension" = "regular dimension"=
"non-reduced dimension". That's a lot of unnecessary aliases. In documentation,
it is important not to fall into using colloquial English when precision is
needed.

So may be we should adopt that. It would avoid confusion between unit and
dimension.

To me, a derived dimension is one which is obtained as a product and/or quotient
of other dimensions (which may be derived and/or basic), but is given a name.
The name describes a term used in the expert area. So <Pressure> is one since it
is defined as <Force>/<Area>. We should allow derived dimension to be defined
this
way, but the point is, a derived dimension has an associated name (like
<Pressure>) and it is this name that is used for later references. In some
sense, a dimension is the name of some property  of one or more objects, and a
unit in this dimension is a quantitative measurement of the property. So
<Pressure> is the name of the property of fluid or gas when their molecules
bombard on a surface and may be measured in say, [Pascal] or [Atmosphere].

That would be a quite a feat, if it were implemented (surely, it is possible).
Whenever (in any language) an expression is computed, the formula may or may not
be retained, and often, it is not when simplification occurs. This is especially
true when there are numerical computations. In the example I gave:

> >   E := setDimUnit("Energy", "kwh", p*t - m*g*h - 1/2 * m * v^2)

any of the identifiers may have symbolic or numerical values involved, and there
is no reason to expect that in the Rep for E, this expression will look anything
like the input expression. My comments on "history" were limited to the
"history" of the dim field in the Rep of E and p. The only one who retains a
knowledge of how E depends on p is the user (through a trace of the inputs).

This is still not clear to me. The word "product" means "result"? You are
confusing "unit" with "dimension"?  Can we give a (pseudo) grammar for what is
<dimension>? From what we have discussed, it seems there are three aspects of
any dimension: a name, a definition, and a reduced form. The name may be
optional, in which case, perhaps we should use as default the reduced form
(converted to String) as name. Here is what I propose as a start, to accommodate
the three aspects: the three fields are tagged by name, definition, and reduced:

  <Basic> := <Mass> | <Length> | ...

  <Name> := "String" | <String> 

(here, String stands for any string, or perhaps identifier, and the two forms
using double-quote or pointed brackets, are considered as interchangeable; a
full grammar for such strings is omitted; <Mass> is an example.)

  <Basic-Dimension>:= (<Mass>, <Mass>, <Mass>) | 
                      (<Length>, <Length>, <Length>) |
                      ...

(this means, the name is <Mass>, and is defined in terms of <Mass> from <Basic>
and the reduced form is also <Mass>)

 
  <Reduced> := "1" | <Basic> | <Reduced>*<Basic> | <Reduced>/<Basic> 

(more precisely, products or quotients of <Basic> in lowest terms, whose
grammatical definition is omitted)

  <Definition> := <Dimension.name> | <Definition> * <Dimension.name>
          | <Definition>/<Dimension.name>

(this means a dimension's definition is formed using a product or quotient of
previously defined dimension names)

  <Dimension>:= (<Name>, <Definition>, <Reduced>)

(not included in the grammar above is the requirement that the reduced part
should be obtained by reducing the definition part to lowest terms; under this
production rule, <Basic-Dimension> is part of <Dimension>).

(If you prefer, you can read the above from bottom up, so that <Dimension> is
the sentence symbol of the grammar).

Note that <Derived-Dimension> is nothing but <Dimension> \ <Basic-Dimension>.

Examples would be

    (<Pressure>, <Force>/<Area>, <Mass>/(<Length>*<Time>^2))

    (<Force>, <Mass>*<Acceleration>, <Mass>*<Length>/<Time>^2)

    (<Area>, <Length>^2, <Length>^2)

In the same way, we can define the grammar for Unit, with an added tag:
abbreviation. (Details left as an exercise for the reader :-))

This is not what I would call "reduced dimension". I would say the ENTIRE
expression <Mass>*<Length>/<Time>^2 is ONE reduced dimension, namely, the
reduced form of <Force>. Each component is a BASIC-dimension. In the paragraph
below, you WERE using "reduced dimension" in MY sense.

Why do we have ANY (casual) simplification FROM base dimensions TO derived
dimensions? Need to clarify your thoughts -- after some sleep? :-).

> Sorry.  regular dimension = normal dimension or just plain "dimension".

But I want to keep the two (reduced and not-reduced) forms of a unit, if they
are different. So I may want to use both [Newton] and [kg][m]/[s]^2 for the unit
of <Force>. Another example, for the unit of <Pressure>, I want to keep three
aspects of it: name, definition, and reduced (just like Dimension); and in
addition, abbreviation.

    ([Pascal], [Newton]/[m]^2, [kg]/([m]*[s]^2), [Pa])

If such information is derived from information retained in <Pressure>, we will
only be able to use the default units, not perhaps the user chosen units after
using a setDimUnit command. Note that in the above, I have not included the
Dimension for the unit named [Pascal]. This is because in case there is no name
(or if the default name is simply the definition or reduced tag value), then it
would not be clear what dimension the unit should belong to. If a Dimension MUST
be included, then it would be biased in the sense that the programmed code may
use that more often over other possibilities because of convenience.

I take that to mean you want to force the user to associate a dimension with a
unit he uses. That's reasonable. However, for the system, a unit can be
standalone and not associated with a dimension until used. The representation
for a dimensionless unit like radian can be:

   ([Radian], [m]/[m], [1], [rad])

I think it would make more sense to require that a basic unit be associated with
a basic dimension, because the dimension would be unique.

11 years ago.  Hmm, I absolutely shouldn't remember.  In any case, try
explicitly doing )lib graphcat before loading the second file.  The
file-imports macro should probably be smartened up to force an autoload,
but it hasn't been yet.

I'm a bit rusty on all this, and my knowledge out of date. So caveat
blah-de-blah. For those that don't know remember my mini-intro some time
back, I was one of James Davenport's PhD students charged with finding a
mathematical foundation for coercion in Axiom.

http://worldofnic.org/research/phd.ps

Chapter 2 of my thesis gave some introduction to the mathematical
formulation of Categories in Axiom/Magma/OBJ.

Chapter 3 talks about Category Theory.
Chapter 4 talks about Order Sorted Algebra.
(Both these chapters put these definitions in Axiom terms at the end).

Chapter 9 talks about where I'd like Axiom to go.

Some of my "ideas" in my thesis are wrong and I no longer stand by them.
I was naive. Please ignore 9.7 and any assertions that Axiom should be
written in Axiom. ;-)

In some ways, it is far more useful to not think of Axiom in terms of
Category Theory. Functors etc. are useful sometimes when thinking
abstractly about Axiom, but Axiom's true roots are in Order Sorted
Algebra.

In axiom a Category is an Order Sorted Signature, but the order on the
sorts is never explicitly defined and there are some difficulties in the
definition of the operator symbols.

OBJ _is_ based on Order Sorted Algebra. It's main advantage over Axiom
as I see it, is that it defines Theories. A Theory is an Order Sorted
Signature with (and this is what Axiom misses) a set of equations. This
means that in Axiom we are free to say that MyDomain is in MyCategory,
but certain assertions that we as mathematicians know about all Domains
in MyCategory may not be true in MyDomain. Will literate programming
help? Maybe. Will it enforce? Nope.

Another fantastic advantage of OBJ is a view. In Axiom we can not say
that MyDomain forms a Group over the operator * and the operator +,
because the operator is hard-coded into the Group Category. This
sucks. :-( Changing this behaviour is left as an exercise to the reader
with time to rewrite almost all of Axiom. :-)

Just a quick note - I sent my latest attempt at precise definitions of the 
ideas we need to William.  At this point I think we should hash out our 
definitions before we go too much further, since I'm starting to get tangled 
up ;-).

Also - Tim, a question about Axiom in general - Do we have somewhere in Axiom 
a thorough description on the mathematical principles it's based on?  
(Groups, Rings, etc.?)  Do the pamphlet files cover all that?  I'm not sure 
making Axiom into a huge self contained introduction and definition of all 
mathematics is a workable or desirable goal, but it would be nice to define a 
minimum education level needed to work with the system and recommend some 
resources for various education levels to get them started.

Cheers,
CY

Dear Bill,

I think that it is a great thing that you start experimenting with graphs. I
hope I can assist you when it comes to the theoretic framework.

Two (rather different) suggestions:

* you might want to look at how graphs are done in mupad and in
  Mathematica. For Mathematica, the relevant source is available at

  http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~skiena/combinatorica/

  you will probable have to install MathReader from Wolfram. Mupads libraries
  are open source anyway, and the documentation is well done, too.

* more importantly, I urge you to *sketch* the interactions within the whole
  complex of graph-like structures on a piece of papers -- asking questions,
  where needed.

  I'd love to have (oriented) Matroids, (weighted) Graphs, (weighted) Digraphs,
  greedoids, etc. treated in a uniform fashion. Some thinking should go in the
  appropriate representation, probably. I think that your approach is good,
  though. It would certainly pay to collect the various common data structures
  and see which concepts match and which don't. Note, for example, that
  oriented matroids do *not* correspond to digraphs. Then, we'd have to see
  whether unweighted and weighted graphs should be together in one domain or
  should rather be two domains. It is pretty clear to me that digraphs and
  graphs should be two separate domains, maybe having a common ancestor.

  In fact, what is probably necessary is to find good common ancestors. Note
  that a domain may be of several different categories!



  Some examples for possible coercions:

  weighted Graph +-> weighted Digraph: 

    each edge becomes two arcs in opposite directions, each of the arcs having
    the same weight as the edge.

  Digraph +-> Graph: 

    take the underlying graph. But what happens with weights

  Graph +-> Matroid:
  
    take the cycle matroid of the graph

  Graph +-> Matroid:

    there are other constructions, too.


  3-connected Matroid <-> 3-connected Graph

    it is possible to reconstruct the stars of the graph here.


  etc, etc.

Martin

I think I already tried what you suggest?

http://axiom-developer.org/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphs

The explicit )library GRAPHCAT command apparently succeeds but
later 'file-imports' still says:

   AxiomXL file "GRAPHCAT" is missing!

Since I can't find a call to 'file-imports' anywhere in the
Axiom src directories (did I miss it?), am I correct that
a call to this macro is contained lisp code generated by
Aldor?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Nicolas, I am glad to see you here! I discovered your thesis just
a few weeks ago and put a pdf version here in the Axiom portal
reference section:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/refs/articles/doye-aldor-phd.

This might be useful for people who are "ps-challenged". Please
let me know if this is acceptible re copyright etc.

I think it would be great to see an application of Goguen's
"Hidden Algegra" for correctness proofs in Axiom/Aldor:

It is clear that what Axiom calls a "category" is not a category
in the sense of category theory. I think your approach to
understanding just what is a "category" in Axiom has a lot of
merit.

But of course this is a different objective than *implementing*
category theory in Axiom. This is simply a matter of the design
of appropriate algebra library code. From my point of view a
category (in the sense of category theory) in Axiom must end up
as one or more domains within some Axiom "category" of categories.

This is unfortunate terminology. From the point of view of the
mathematics it might be preferrable to refer to Axiom's concept
of category as a "class" but then that also has terminological
problems.

We have time here given Tim's "thirty year horizon" ... :)

Do you have any ideas about how we might begin to apply OBJ
to Axiom and Aldor?

I am reasonably familiar with graph theory from a computer
science perspective and from the point of view of category
theory. What I had in mind is an implementation of graphs in
Axiom more or less from first principles. Looking at Mathematica
and Mupad should be interesting as examples of applications
but I am sceptical (maybe I am wrong?) that they would provide
the kind of foundation that is needed in Axiom.

Do you have some specific suggestions for things to look for?

That is a good idea, but for other reasons I am motivated to
use MathAction SandBox and email rather than paper. :)

Yes. One of the things I want graphs for in Axiom is that
(eventually) I also want categories. Being able to explore
matroids in Axiom is also very attractive. We (including
Bertfried Fauser) discussed matroids here long ago in connection
with general (possibly cyclical) dependency structures in
Axiom.

But more immediately, I think FiniteGraph would be very useful
for an implementation of the dependency computation in Peter
Broadbery's Aldor interface (to replace the Java code). To do
that it makes sense to implement this code in Aldor so that it
could be compiled stand alone. But trying this in Axiom lead me
to the distraction of an apparent problem in the way Aldor
categories are handled in Axiom.

Still, this can be done entirely in Axiom with SPAD for now
and we can worry about porting it to Aldor later.

I expect that one would need multiple representations depending
on the particular purpose. For example, from a formal point of
view I want both FiniteGraph with explicit added nodes and
edges, as well as the IntegerGraph with the < order relation to
be in GraphCategory. The issue here with respect to defining
GraphCategory seems to be as inclusive as possible in the
interface, i.e. the exported operations. In both the example
graph domains above I can ask

  edge?(n1,n2)

but I might not expect

  edgeList(G)

to be available for all domains in GraphCategory (although
perhaps in the case of IntegerGraph, it might return an iterator).

I would expect two domains but *maybe* in the same category.
Maybe GraphCategory can be defined from MatroidCategory?

Undirected graphs (as an Axiom category) could be defined in
terms of directed graphs with an extra condition and then a
undirected graph might be represented as a pair of directed
edges, etc. But this might not be particularly efficient for
some graph algorithms. It is certainly an advantage in Axiom
that we can (usually) write polymorphic algorithms that can
be applied independent of the underlying representation. In
other cases the algorithms might need to take specific advantage
of a given representation. I think I understand how this can
be made to work in Axiom.

So for me the design issues concern mostly how we might choose
to encode the known mathematics of graphs (and related
combinatoric structures) in Axiom at a higher level, i.e. in
terms of Axiom categories.

Yes, that is quite important. In Axiom we are not constrained
to simply define class hierarchies.

Probably we need to consider other functors in addition to
coercions? I would really like to have more "category theory"
here in Axiom to deal with things like this.

Yes, I agree that being able to express these mathematical

Exactly.

not yet. One idea I had when I implemented my graphs-package for maxima (which
is not in a useable state, though) is to extensively use lazy evaluation, very
much like the way polymake works. In terms of graphs, a graph would be
represented by a list of properties, and when you ask for some property, like,
for example, connected?, the list is searched for the property itself, then for
other properties which might imply connectedness and if all fails, an algorithm
that computes the desired property is invoked. This idea works well, if the
amount of storage needed doesn't matter or else for properties that don't need
much, like the chromatic index or the Tutte polynomial. It is, of course,
nearly the same as caching previously computed values. (Nearly, because
sometimes a property has already been computed that implies the desired
property.)

Yes, I very much like the idea to have a category of graphs and then domains
for finite and infinite graphs. (I think that there is not yet a package that
handles infinite graphs at all.)

Exactly.

 > Maybe GraphCategory can be defined from MatroidCategory?

Hmm, maybe we shouldn't have categories for structures (like matroids, graphs,
digraphs, etc.) but rather for properties. In fact, this led to a definition of
matroid: a matroid is a collection I of sets (called independend sets) such
that

* \emptyset \in I

* I1\in I and I2\subseteq I1 => I2\in I

* the greedy algorithm works, i.e., it always finds a set I1 \in I achieving
  the maximum weight, regardless of the (nonnegative) weight function.

I'm afraid that this can lead to trouble. It can be done - and it might be even
the *right* way to do it, but it entails a lot of work. Many concepts used for
graphs and digraphs nearly match but not quite. One example, which does work is
the concept of degree: the degree in the graph is the indegree (which equals
the outdegree) in the corresponding digraph.

But as I noted before: what are we going to do with the weights. Usually, the
degree in a graph is the sum of the weights of the edges. This will be the same
as the sum of the weight of the incoming arcs in the corresponding digraph.

However: the total weight of the graph is (usually) the product of all its edge
weights. Hence the total weight of the corresponding digraph is the weight of
the graph squared. Thus we can have an operation weight in the category of all
graphs, but it means slightly different things in digraphs and in graphs.

So, the first step possibly is to propose some categories. A different approach
is to concentrate on finite graphs first and write the categories later.

I don't understand you here.

Elaborate on what, other constructions?

I wanted to play with axiomui, so I checked out this branch.

Just a couple of niggles:
    1) the Makefile.pamphlet contains default paths ${AXIOM}/bin/lib/
    for notangle and noweave.  This path is highly nonstandard...  For
    instance the debian package 'nowebm' puts these files in /usr/bin
    (and note this is also unrelated to ${AXIOM}).

    2) AXIOMsys needs to have a path from ${AXIOM}

    3) the server is actually listening on port 8080, not 5050 as the
    documentation states.

looks good!

Who is "arch@axiom-developer.org"? Is this intended to queue
the patch for inclusion in the tla archive?

I asked Kai to use this path for notangle and noweave since this
is the standard location for the versions of notangle and noweave
that are used with the Axiom build (except for Debian). The Debian
build for Axiom has not been integrated with the other linux
environments. It is maintained by Camm Maguire.

The standard Axiom build applies a simple patch to the notangle.
I am not sure how this is handled on Debian. Camm?

If we were to require notangle and noweave as dependencies on
non-Debian systems, satisfying the dependencies might not be
so straight forward on some systems. Also, since Axiom patches
notangle in a way that was not accepted by it's original author,
it does not seem like such a good thing for the Axiom to place
it's versions in /usr/bin ...

>    2) AXIOMsys needs to have a path from ${AXIOM}

I am not sure I understand what you mean here. Normally AXIOMsys
is accessible from the PATH if Axiom has been installed. Is this
not true on Debian?

I think we need to make some plans as to were to go from here.

For instance, what we have right now is essentially a replacement
for "console-style" input but with nicely formatted math output
and in-line 2-d graphics. Kai has also implemented, but not yet
integrated with the current version, the hyperdoc Axiom documentation
browser.

I think what we really want (at least what I want :) is a
"worksheet-style" interface looks (more or less) like MathAction
but tailored for individual use (like tiddlywiki). Also of course
there is the question of how to handle 3-d graphics and how to
interact with the graphics in a manner similar to the existing
Axiom graphics package on linux.

One (perhaps longer term?) goal of this re-implementation of
features is to provide the same or equivalent features in a
platform independent implementation that will work the same
on both linux and windows. So far the current version does not
(quite) work on Windows due some non-portable clisp code.

Let's discuss this a little more...

Regards,
Bill Page.

The download link on this page:
    http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload
doesn't work.  Specifically this link:
    http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/DOWNLOADS/axiom-Sept2005-src.tgz
doesn't work, and I can't find the tarball anywhere on
axiom.axiom-developer.org...

I fixed the links on that page for Debian, which is now in "unstable"
that Sarge has been released.

Also FYI I'm trying to get Kai's axiom--GUI-1 to work, and it seems that
it doesn't like axiom 3.4 from April.  After typing in a command it
quits with just "Bye".

Sorry, Bob, my mistake. I have been trying to rationalize things
on the various virtual server names that we use on axiom-developer
and I forgot about that download links. It should work now.

My goal is to setup some simple virtual server names and shorten
the urls as much as possible. Now by default

http://axiom.axiom-developer.org

will list the current Axiom source in the darcs repository for
axiom--main--1 on axiom-developer. This is the version of Axiom
that is currently running on this server and may lag slightly
the version in tla. My plan is that this souce will (eventually)
be searchable online and will be available for direct url
reference.

Just yesterday I finished setting up a new name for the Axiom
wiki.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

should now work to access MathAction with the shortest possible
urls. These are exactly the same pages addressed by:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction

and

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction

and

http://axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction

For now these older names should continue to work. But eventually
when this is all done, I would like to retire those that are
clearly redundant.

I am also planning to implement

http://portal.axiom-developer.org

which will be identical to

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone

If anyone has any comments about this re-organization, please
let me know.

Thanks!

Isn't that the version that Kai recommended in the docs?

In my case I tested axiom--GUI--1 with Axiom build with the
axiom--main--1--patch-45 sources.

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. Who is arch@axiom-developer.org?

I suspect I missed a discussion from a while back, but I am a bit
surprised www.axiom-developer.org doesn't default to
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone It seems to be a little
easier to follow to my eye, and has a clean, modern look that seems a
bit more professional than the current default.  With the relevant
content from the current Frontpage on it it would seem to be a good
first impression of Axiom.  (Please note this is just one guy's opinion
from a casual glance - I apologize if there are good reasons for the
current setup I'm not thinking of.)

Cheers,
CY

Also this page contains "axiomicon.png" which doesn't exist, and causes
a reflow...

On this page could you add explicit "width" and "height" attributes for
the img tags?  This page "reflows" several times during load, as it gets
each of the images and determines their size...

I think they should be retired ASAP as the site organization has been
quite confusing.

I think we should decide on one or the other.  Having multiple sites
makes it very confusing.

Yes.  I'm building the savannah CVS tarball now.  If that doesn't work
then I have some other problem...

Ok, fixed I think. Also the CAISS logo and I included height and
width for each image.

Better?

Maybe you should use a smarter browser? ;) FireFox doesn't do
that to me.

Ok, I added the width and height. Is that better?

It's hard to make changes quickly when things have been around
for a while. I worry about broken links. But when everything is
working nicely, then it makes sense to me to advertize the
changes widely and then set a time limit like 1 month before
removing the old names.

Do you mean decide on "wiki" or "portal", i.e. Plone? I have also
had this discussion with Martin Rubey. I have argued that these
are two quite different web services. The wiki is open and public
while the portal has more controlled access for content creation.
It is possible to create both public and private wiki pages in Plone
and there are other features of the portal such as bibliography,
event notices, etc.

Of course the user interface for the wiki is much simpler than the
portal. So far the portal has not had much use although nearly 60
people have registered to use it. But then again, only a very few
people have even edited any wiki pages. So I guess that's how it
goes in the "collaborative web" :-(

Regards,
Bill Page.

It was the missing image that was causing the reflow.  (I am using

If you really like plone, why not move all wiki pages into plone?

I like the improvements you've made on the wiki a lot.  I would add that
we should separate the "discussion" page from the wiki page itself.
(Just make a [Page Discussion] wiki page where emails and comments go)
ZWiki collects page clutter quickly since comments get added to the same
page, then everyone is afraid to delete them, and there is no automated
method to archive them.

If we all prefer the ZWiki interface though, then we need to add user
login.  This product looks good:

Found it - aldor is being picky about the case of file names; it
(effectively) requires that aldor file names should be all lower case. 

I'm not precisely sure what is doing the downcasing;  I suspect that the
function set-file-getter and other things in daase.lisp are involved,
but it needs a bit more tracing down.

Since daase calls pathname-name all over the place could it be
related to this email exchange between Tim Daly and Camm Maquire?

Yes, I think you are right. I changed the short name (abbreviation=3D
file name?) of my Aldor category from upper case to lower case and
now it **sometimes** works. See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphs

But often when I try to save this page I get:

    >> System error:
    Contiguous blocks exhausted.
  Currently, 1354 pages are allocated.
  Use ALLOCATE-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES to expand the space.

And Axiom aborts near completion.

The problem seems to be intermittent. About 1 time out of 5 when
I save the page it succeeds as you see it above.  Odd that I
don't get the same result each time since it starts a new Axiom
session each time! This seems like it might be some interaction
between Axiom's requirements and GCL's memory allocation. Yuck.

Regards,
Bill Page.

>=20

In several tests, it seems like the Axiom/lisp command:

  )lisp (si::allocate-contiguous-pages 3000 t)

might cure the problem. If this is a memory allocation problem,
then perhaps this can be specified as larger default when the
Axiom build build compiles GCL? Does anyone know the correct
build parameter to set?

Regards,

Thanks! I guess that would be in the <<Makefile.linux>> section
of Makefile.pamphlet which in turn calls <<GCLOPTS>> which
eventually creates Makefile.linux, right? I am currently
rebuilding Axiom on MathAction right now with this increased
parameter.

I've encountered your problem and augmenting MAXPAGE resolve it.

Hmmm... but if I try 192 instead of 128 or 256 then the GCL build stops
with the message: "MAXPAGE is not a power of 2".

I'm stumped. :(

Are you sure that this is the option related to =
ALLOCATE-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES ?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

After editing Makefile.pamphlet and before running 'make' did you
delete 'lsp/gcldir' and 'lsp/gcl-2.6.7' ?

I presume that would be necessary to get Axiom to build a new
version of gcl, right?

Bill Page.

Yes, gcl-2.6.7 and gcldir (my configuration uses MAXPAGE=3D512*1024).
May be a problem of RAM (i have 1GB).

I suppose I should know better, but I have a couple "broad scope"
questions about Axiom:

a)  Given the ideal of theoretically backing the mathematics in Axiom
and perhaps even incorporating a proof system into the core design, how
do we handle/document/formalize the interface between "Axiom-level"
code and the underlying lisp functionality?  Ideally, a "provable"
system would be backed by proofs all the way down to the machine code
and chip design levels, but that's well beyond the scope of the Axiom
project.  I'm assuming the point we would want to start using proof
logic is the point where the actual "mathematics" beings, as opposed to
the computational tools and structures needed to support it - is this
correct?  Effectively treat the behavior of the underlying lisp as a
big set of "axioms" (in the mathematical sense) and build off of them?

b)  If we are interested in using Aldor as opposed to Spad for the
"standard" Axiom language, and are forced to re-implement an Aldor
environment due to licensing concerns, would that be the time to build
in proof systems and tools?  Or even if we don't have to redo the
environment - mightn't it still be the time?  Then as we convert things
over to Aldor, document them and prove relevant properties?

c)  I know it's somewhat impractical, but I like the idea of
implementing something once, correctly, documenting it fully, and then
never having to do it again.  Axiom gets closer to that ideal than
virtually any other system I have seen (well, except maybe TeX ;-) and
I think it's one of the great strengths of the program.  I don't know
if unit testing makes much sense for Axiom on the mathematical level
(although perhaps that's what things like CATS are, really) but I can't
help thinking we could benefit if we had some tests which checked for
expected (and depended upon) behaviors from the lisp, OS, windowing
system, or whatever we happen to be depending on.  Ideally, any system
which passed the low level unit tests could properly run Axiom,
although of course more work than that would be needed to rigorously
prove that all answers provided were correct.  Then, if we match those
requirements to things available in the ANSI standard (maybe Paul's
extensive ANSI test suite could provide some ideas for relevant tests
to make), we could claim that it's not our fault if a lisp doesn't
support Axiom ;-)

d)  Tim, assuming I'm not way off base, would it be possible to sort of
define the steps we want to take to get from where we are to the 30
years sytem - e.g. something like:

1) decide on proof system to use, if in fact that's the way we want to
go.
2) integrate proof system with Aldor language and environment
3) outline bootstrapping order in which to document and port systems to
Aldor+Proof Core.
4) As migration occurs, document mathematical theory of all levels and
requirements of Axiom in terms of support from the underlying lisp. 
After a while, with any luck new functionality will be transferred
entirely inside Axiom and the lisp requirements will be clear.

Of course, doing this robustly probably WOULD take 30 years, but then
we would never have to do it again ;-).  I know the more short term
goal is to get the beastie fully working at it's original levels, but
it would be fun to have some broad steps toward the "ideal" Axiom to
start poking around with :-).

Cheers,
CY

Yes I think so. To me this means specifically the SPAD and/or
Aldor code from the Axiom algebra library.

>From my point of view lisp has very little to do with this
issue. Sorry. :) Consider the fact that the Aldor compiler can
output C code which then gets compiled into machine code by a
C compiler like gcc, just as easily as it can produce lisp code
that either gets interpreted or compiled in turn. To say this
with a positive spin: Lisp is too general and flexible a language
to be well suited to mathematical proofs. A "higher level", i.e.
more semantically constrained and focused language (in the sense
of having a smaller set of more complex primitive operations)
such as SPAD or Aldor, is better suited to expressing mathematical
algorithms nearer the conceptual level at which mathematics
itself is done. Of course this is not a claim that such is not
possible in lisp - it's just that the language (or maybe
sometimes just common practice) does not encourage such usage.

The point is that the "meaning" or semantics of SPAD and Aldor
programs can be specified quite independently of the actually
implementation. Most of this specification of meaning actually
involves known mathematics to a much larger extent then the
usual application of proof techniques to the correctness of
programs in general. I think a claim could be made that
proving that a particular algorithm written in SPAD correctly
implements some specific mathematical result or technique might
be considered formally less difficult (in principle) than
general program correctness because most of the proof can be
carried out at a higher level.

I think you are right that proving the correctness of the
compiler itself or the interpreter needs to be addressed at
a different level. Even within Axiom there are several
intermediate levels, e.g. BOOT code, that could be addressed
separately. Then all the way down to machine code and from
there (in principle) even to the physics. But for *mathematics*
I think (almost) all of the interesting stuff is at the
top of this hierarchy of languages.

Personally I think that failure to include Aldor in with Axiom
because of licensing issues would be a minor disaster for both
Axiom and Aldor. I doubt very much that sufficient interested
resources exist anywhere at this point to take on a task like
re-implementing Aldor. Implementing a compiler for a language like
Aldor is already a very BIG job. And imagining adding a program
proof systems on top of that at the same time does not makes much
sense. Also keep in mind that there are a number of very active
projects in this area already such as Haskell, OCaml and OBJ
(to name just a few).

Yes, I think that is the right approach! That is exactly where
Tim's ideas about literate program should be the most use.

I don't think that is just impractical I think it has been
demonstrated many times over that it is *impossible*! From my
point of view good programming practice these days amounts to
finding ways to do many of the same things over again, in fact
several times over, but to do it efficiently and with (much)
less pain. We need methods for fluently "re-factoring" programs
at a very high level - iteratively re-thinking, documenting and
re-implementing the basic internal design and the relationships
between the components. This is one of the essential tasks of
high level programming language design. I think one of the
fascinating aspects of programming languages like SPAD and Aldor
is that they do in fact seem to facilitate this process.

I think it is much easier to prove "conditional truths",
i.e. proving that the output of a particular algorithm written
in Aldor correctly implements some abstract mathematical
concept ... assuming that the compiler/interpreter and underlying
computer system perform according to spec. Of course this a
weaker result that what the end-user probably desires, but as
far as I can see human intellectual limitations making any
except a level-by-level approach practical.

As I see it "regression testing" is really what Tim's CATS
project can offer - proving that new versions of some package
or module do not produce newly incorrect results which formerly
were deemed to be correct. Or simply showing clearly where the
differences lie. I say "deemed to be correct" because in some
case the lack of formal proofs and the lack of clear and
unambiguous understanding of a problem means that what is
taken to be true at one time *might* change a little over time.

No, I don't think this is the correct view. It is because of
tools like lisp that we can even work at this higher level
at all. We should not be looking to "move the blame" but
rather thinking in terms of building an elaborate and ever
higher scaffolding - sometimes shoring it up underneath and
sometimes building it higher... (: How's that for imagery? :)

I am very interested to see how Tim will respond to this since
very often we have different views although many of our goals
are the same. :) But I would say emphatically "no" to this. I
think Axiom needs to be open to the application of several
different proof methodologies. (notice my emphasis on the word
*open*).

Yes. In fact there has already been some published research
on exactly this topic. Check out some of the articles at

Yes. This is very important. It simply must be done if Axiom's
future is to extend to the 30 year horizon.

No. This does not make sense to me. As I said, lisp has very
little to do with this - except as an intermediate language that
is well-suited to bridging the gap between machine architecture
and high-level complex programming abstractions. It is well suited
primarily because it does not constrain the underlying computational
metaphor. It is like a very high level machine language. But it is
*not* a language that is well suited to expressing high-level
mathematical abstractions - that happens only several levels higher
up.

I simply do not believe this. If a computer sales person told me
this about some fantastic new computer system, then I think I
would very quickly show him or her the door. :(

Finally.... yes indeed. I agree whole heartedly. I think your
project with units of measure and physical dimensions in Axiom
is a very good example. And I like to think of my interest in
category theory in Axiom in the same light.

Heh - thanks :-).  I remember my uncle saying once that the only way he
rebuilt a country farmhouse into a really nice family home was by not
knowing how much work it was going to be - I sort of wonder if that's
me looking Axiom over ;-).

Hopefully the Coyotos project will get somewhere, but they're still
busy designing a language that will work for what they want to do,
IIRC.  Oh, well - maybe in 30 years ;-).

Right.  Although I think it is important to try to understand
thoroughly how the basic tools used at the SPAD/Aldor level interact
with their "computer level" support structure.

No problem - I had assumed lisp was critical to Axiom.  Either way,
assume the "computer" behavior is as specified.

Well, I'm not going to argue that lisp isn't extremely general ;-). 
It's a good point.

Right.  I think for this we want to stay as close to the math as
possible, so I'll agree with you there.

Not sure about that one.  Sounds reasonable though.

OK.  I think the intermediate levels should at least be thoroughly
documented though, so if someday it becomes possible to really apply
proof techniques to them too it's easier going for whoever tries it. 
Plus, we can probably find bugs more easily that way ;-).

I don't disagree, but the Macsyma Inc. experience is sufficient warning
that depending on non-open and/or non-free code is not viable if one
wants to be sure of long term viability and potentially universal
usage.  That's the reason license issues always generate so much
discussion - people know how important they are in the long term.  I
think we should act fairly soon to clarify the Aldor situation, but I
don't know where the situation stands any more.  This
(http://aldor.org/license-rationale.html) was written some years ago,
and I don't see much recent activity on the Aldor list except from
Axiom folk.

Well, I was thinking the proof subsystem would need to be integrated
into the Aldor language itself, but perhaps not.  Anyway, I would be
very definitely against Axiom becoming dependant on non-free software,
whatever the potential gains might be.

I was hoping being close to the mathematics would help keep things
organized in that regard - not to say a new, more efficient
proof/algorithm couldn't supercede an old one, but ideally the rest of
Axiom wouldn't have to worry HOW a particular piece was proven or a
particular algorithm was used.

I must confess I don't quite follow here.  Let's say we implement the
Risch algorithm for integration, and subject it to the relevant proofs.
 Won't we be able to work off of that implementation and not have to
create it again elsewhere?

Heh.  Of course, it could be that nobody dares to touch it, either...

That's where I think unit testing could be helpful.  I agree that's how
we need to approach it, but that doesn't preclude a) checking this
behavior experimentally and b) someday applying advanced programming
techniques to prove the implementation of the compiler et. al. work as
advertised.

Sure.  All we can worry about is the Axiom layer, but if we do it right
it will be able to take advantage of eventual other proven layers and
perhaps in time a system will be created that mathematicians will be
able to trust.

Right.  CATS would effectively be a "top level" functionality test,
while unit testing would be much lower level.  CATS being the more
useful for checking that all the pieces work together as they are
supposed to, and unit testing checking that each piece works as it is
supposed to.

Nice :-).  But at least these testing setups will tell us what we need
to shore up.  Think of it as Dtrace for Axiom ;-).

I think I saw a paper about adapting one proof to other proof systems -
IIRC it was surprisingly difficult.  I should see if I can dig that up
again.

But isn't it essential?  A proven system will have to build itself out
of proven components, and so doesn't Axiom of necessity have to be
built much as the logic of mathematics itself is built?

Yep.  This is the part I would like to starting thinking about, because
even 30 years might turn out to be a short time given the scope of
mathematics.

OK, but there must be some separation between the mathematical logic of
Axiom, and the supporting OS/system libraries/compiler on which it
depends for basic computational functionality.  I would prefer that
that interface be as well understood as possible, and if the supporting
software ever reaches proven stage things could be plugged in rather
nicely - in essence, switched from "assumed" to "proven" :-).

OK.  But since in the end all functionality of Axiom rests on those
lower layers functioning properly, wouldn't it be a good idea to at
least have some idea of what we are expecting of them?

How about if they presented you with a book of proofs about critical
system functionality and system security? ;-)  You might upgrade it
with better algorithms or cleaner proofs to make it more efficient, but
if the functionality is what you desire wouldn't the basic problem be
solved?

I agree it might not be practical, but darn it I hate the idea of
someone having to redo Axiom somewhere down the road.  Mathematics is
mathematics, after all.

I agree.  Units and dimensions is a bit more of a "practical" project
in the sense of wanting to use Axiom's abilities in the sciences, but I
will try my best to do it the "right way" and hopefully, if proof logic
comes to Axiom, it will be straightforward to port the units pamphlet
into the new world :-)  Category theory, on the other hand, is
fundamental to what Axiom is :-).  

Cheers,

Hello, 

I start from a Polynomial Integer : (2*x+3*y)*(4*z+2*x)
     or better from an Expression : (2*log(x)+3*exp(y))*(4*sin(z)+2*log(x))

And I want to get every term : 6 xy, 8 xz, 12 yz and 4 x^2 
                          or   6 %e^y log(x), etc. 
and get easily the integer 6, 8, 12 or 4.

With mupad I do 
 [op (normal ((2*x+3*y)*(4*z+2*x)))] ;
 map ([op (normal ((2*x+3*y)*(4*z+2*x)))], t-> [coeff(t), t/coeff(t)]) ;

The first give me the list  [6 x y, 8 x z, 12 y z, 4 x^2]
and the second              [[6, x y], [8, x z], [12, y z], [4, x ]]

Of corse the command t/coeff(t) isn't the faster way, 
but I don't find better.

How can I do this in an *.input axiom file ?

I look in the big book, I believe I must use DMP, not SUP, but I'm not sure.

Must I use leadingCoefficient, leadingCoefficient and reductum 
or can I use a List coerce ? but I don't find the command.

And I want to play with expression, not polynomial ; 
then what coerce must I do ?

Thanks a lot for any advice, and have a good day !

So we create a Polynomial(Integer) thus:

m := 3*x^2 + 2*x +6

and we ask for the monomials:

p := monomials(m)

which returns a List(Polynomial(Integer))

We can ask for the length of the list using the # operator

#p

We can ask for an element of the list using the elt operator

elt(p,1)

or just use the notation p.1, p.2, etc

We can ask for the coefficient of a monomial with

coefficient(p.1,x,2) 

where x is the variable of interest (it might be multivariate)
and 2 is the power (we could have used the whole polynomial
directly as in

   coefficient(m,x,2)

We can generate a list with the notation

[ function for i in a..b]

So we can directly create a list of the coefficients in the
variable 'x' with

[coefficient(elt(p,i),x,#p-i) for i in 1..#p]

Of course, Axiom is strongly typed and cannot guarantee that the
expression #p-i will always be non-negative. It will complain about
this and "step thru" (interpret) the expression. You can cure this
by explicitly telling it that the expression is always a non-negative
integer (NNI) thus:

[coefficient(elt(p,i),x,(#p-i)::NNI) for i in 1..#p]

which will return a list of the coefficients of the monomials.

The same thing will work if you start with an Expression(Integer).


n:EXPR(INT) := 3*x^2 + 2*x +6
p:=monomials(n)

which returns a LIST(POLY(INT)) and you are back to the previous case

There is also mmm-mode. That should be even better if several file types
are mixed withing a pamphlet file.

In the paper "On the way to certify Computer Algebra Systems" by S.
Boulm'e, T. Hardin, D. Hirschkoff, V. M'enissier-Morain, and R. Rioboo
the following description is made: 

"Within a previous project, we have tried to interface Axiom and the
Coq proof assistant, with the aim of proving some properties of Axiom
programs[1]. A prototype has been done, consisting firstly in
interfaces between libraries of Axiom (basic, sets, ordered sets, . . .
, groups) with the corresponding theories in Coq, and secondly, in a
compiler from Axiom functions to their specifications in Coq. The
emphasis has been put on the compilation of the hierarchy of categories
and domains; as far of the actual code is concerned, only the
imperative kernel was considered. The main outcome of this previous
work was that such a task should rather be attacked using a programming
language whose semantics is fully understood (and, possibly,
formalized). Indeed, for example, some diAEculties arose in modeling
multiple inheritance within Axiom programs, mostly because we could not
coin a precise semantics of this (quite intricate) programming
construct. Overall, it seems that in some sense the Axiom programmer
has too much freedom for his implementation task, and can hence design
programs that are quite diAEcult, if not impossible, to certify. In
particular, the management of definitions by default, as well as
definition overriding, seems diAEcult to handle when it comes to
guarantee a reasonable form of coherence within the "proof" part of a
development."

The reference is apparently to this:

1. Guillaume Alexandre. D'Axiom `a Zermelo. Th`ese de l'universit'e
Paris 6, February 1998. 

Does anyone know if this work is available anywhere?  (An English
translation would be even better :-) This sounds like it pursued almost
exactly what we need, and the results, if available, would be extremely
interesting to review or perhaps even build off of.

Cheers,
CY

Tim Daly answered the part of Francois' question concerning the
case of polynomials (which I have omitted above) but in this case
the example expression is not a polynomial. It is assumed by Axiom
to be of type Expression Integer and cannot be converted to any
of the polynomial types except in a trivial manner, e.g.
DistributedMultivariatePolynomial([x,y,z],Expression Integer)

I have not been able to find any acceptible answer to Francois'
question.

How can I persuade Axiom to write out

(1) -> (2*log(x)+3*exp(y))*(4*sin(z)+2*log(x))

as a "sum of products"? E.g.

(2) -> 8*log(x)*sin(z)+4*log(x)^2+12*exp(y)*sin(z)+6*exp(y)*log(x)

In Axiom, both of these expressions are rendered as

    (8log(x) + 12exp(y))sin(z) + 4log(x)  + 6exp(y)log(x)
                Type: Expression Integer

Why does Axiom choose this peculiar form instead of (1) or (2)?

Why can't Axiom factor and expand such expressions?

In the case of polynomials I can write:

(3) -> ((2*x+3*y)*(4*z+2*x))::DMP([x,y,z],INT)

          2
   (3)  4x  + 6x y + 8x z + 12y z
           Type: DistributedMultivariatePolynomial([x,y,z],Integer)

But there does not seem to be anything type equivalent to

           Type: DistributedExpression Integer

Why not?

Would it make sense to define Distributed as a generic domain
constructor similar to Complex?

Would it be possible to write

  Distributed MultivariatePolynomial([x.y.z],Integer)

and

  Distributed Expression Integer?

(Note the space between Distributed and MultivariatePolynomial.)

Would it be simple to "extend" Expression to a new domain were
expressions are represented (when possible) as sums of products?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill, Francois,

The output form of an expression is determined by the domain. 
The simple example is

m:= 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x + 1/5

yields

    1  2   1     1
    - x  + - x + -
    2      3     5

             Type: Polynomial Fraction Integer


the type was chosen by the interpreter. The "simplest" expression
of this form (a polynomial with fractional coefficients) is printed.

However we can change the type (and thus the printed representation)
by coercion:

m::Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))

     2
  15x  + 10x + 6
  --------------
        30

which is now a fraction whose numerator is a polynomial with
integer coefficients and whose denominator is a polynomial
with integer coefficients.

It is, however, essentially the same expression (module zeros).

so you're asking for a domain whose print representation is a "factored"
form, something like asking axiom:

n:= 345
       Type: PositiveInteger

Now Factored(Integer) has a print representation of:

n::Factored(Integer)

    3 5 23
       Type: Factored Integer


I'm unaware of any existing domain that has a print representation as
a "sum of products" although one could be written. 

Bill writes
> Why can't Axiom factor and expand such expressions?


Axiom can factor and expand such expressions. However when the results
get printed (in Expression(Integer)) they get printed in the form shown.

Instead of "Distributed" perhaps you wanted "Factored" such as

  Factored(Expression(Integer))

however factored currently does not know how to print anything in
factored from other than integers it seems. Since this is a valid
type clearly the print representation could be expanded to cover
the Expression(Integer) values.

Tim

No, I don't see what this has to do with factoring integers
(except by analogy). The factored form of the Francois' example
polynomial is shown in Axiom output (2) below. That is not
the problem.

The polynomial domains that contain the word 'distributed' have
such a representation.

No. So far as I can tell the "factored" form of Francois' Expression
and the original form are identical. See below.

I would like *both* Factored and Distributed as valid types over
Expression Integer. This works for polynomial domains (see below)
except the way of forming the Distributed form is irregular.

(1) -> p1:=3D(2*x+3*y)*(4*z+2*x)

                               2
   (1)  (12y + 8x)z + 6x y + 4x
                                                     Type: Polynomial
Integer
(2) -> p1::Factored POLY INT

   (2)  2(3y + 2x)(2z + x)
                                            Type: Factored Polynomial
Integer
(3) -> p1::DMP([x,y,z],INT)

          2
   (3)  4x  + 6x y + 8x z + 12y z
                     Type:
DistributedMultivariatePolynomial([x,y,z],Integer)
(4) ->

>=20

Isn't there is more to the difference between for example
MP([x,y,z], INT) and DMP([x,y,z], INT) then just the print
representation?

For example, Francois' Expression is

(5) -> p2:=3D(2*log(x)+3*exp(y))*(4*sin(z)+2*log(x))

                        y                 2      y
   (5)  (8log(x) + 12%e )sin(z) + 4log(x)  + 6%e log(x)
                 Type: Expression Integer

And the factored form of the polynomial example is:

(6) -> p1::Factored POLY INT::InputForm

   (6)
   (*  (nilFactor (:: 2 (Polynomial (Integer))) 1)

     (*  (primeFactor (:: (+ (* 3 y) (* 2 x)) (Polynomial (Integer))) 1)
      (primeFactor (:: (+ (* 2 z) x) (Polynomial (Integer))) 1))
     )
                 Type: InputForm

InputForm shows some detail of the internal representation.

On the other hand doing this with Expression Integer appaentely
does not produce a factored form at all.

(16) -> p2::Factored EXPR INT::InputForm

   (16)
   (+  (* (+ (* 8 (log x)) (* 12 (exp y))) (sin z))
    (+ (* 4 (** (log x) 2)) (* (* 6 (exp y)) (log x))))
                 Type: InputForm

Regards,
Bill Page.

As far as I understand, Axiom does not know how to factor expressions:

(6) -> factor(x^2-1::EXPR INT)

         2
   (6)  x  - 1
                                            Type: Factored Expression Integer

And in fact, there is no way to factor an element of Expression INT in general,
since you cannot even test for zero.

So the way to go is to write domains that contain the class of functions you
are interested in, but still allow factorisation. Examples:

Integers

Polynomials

I guess: algebraic functions

I guess: D-finite functions (this would contain quite a bit of the
                             trigonometric stuff, but not all of it)

Maybe, but I doubt it: functions that satisfy an ADE (algebraic differential equation)

and so on. I would advise not to try to "fix" Expression Integer, but rather to
implement categories and domains that are computable.

There are certainly other interesting classes. For a start however, I'd vote
for the hierarchy above, since it is well known, there are many wonderfully
efficient algorithms and it occurs frequently in "real world" problems.

Note that all functions in the hierarchy above can be represented as certain
recurrence equations, so I suspect that *after* doing some maths, a simple (in
the sense of: OK, not perfect) implementation would be quite easy.

If anybody is interested, I can provide more information, and Ralf certainly
can do so, too.

PS: How are graphs going?

I use kernels to get the elementary functions.

Can I substitute theses elementary functions to new variables,
make transforms over polynoms, and substitute the variables back ?

Thanks a lot !

Try this:

(1) -> p2:=3D(2*log(x)+3*exp(y))*(4*sin(z)+2*log(x))

                       y                 2      y
   (1)  (8log(x) + 12%e )sin(z) + 4log(x)  + 6%e log(x)
                      Type: Expression Integer

(2) -> p3:=3Deval(monomials( _
             subst(p2,kernels p2,[x,y,z,w])::DMP([x,y,z,w],INT) _
           ),[x,y,z,w],kernels p2)

                           y              2    y
   (2)  [8log(x)sin(z),12%e sin(z),4log(x) ,6%e log(x)]

For example:

                        y                 2      y

(17) -> subst(ex, kernels ex, [x1,x2,x3])::DMP([x1,x2,x3], INT)

                               2
   (17)  8x1 x2 + 12x1 x3 + 4x2  + 6x2 x3

please use the notion "kernel". The notion "elementary function" is already
taken by two other things ... ;-)

yes...

Well, as soon as you go back, you'll loose the transformations you did...

The "deeper" reason why there is no domain DistributedExpression is probably
that DMP defined in gdpoly.spad asks for a List Symbol as variables. It
probably could be in fact any finite OrderedSet, but it would need some work to
get it done.

A simple workaround is 

out(p, kl, vl) == 
  if reductum p = 0 
  then (eval(leadingMonomial(p)::EXPR INT, vl, kl))::OUTFORM
  else (eval(leadingMonomial(p)::EXPR INT, vl, kl))::OUTFORM _
       + out(reductum p, kl, vl)

output ex == 
  kl := kernels ex
  vl := [subscript('x, [i::OutputForm]) for i in 1..#kl]
  out(subst(ex, kl, vl)::DMP(vl, INT), kl, vl)

Note that this returns an element of OUTFORM. This can be circumvented: highly
undebugged, undocumented and all the bad things :-)


)abb domain DEXPR DistributedExpression
DistributedExpression(R: Join(Ring, OrderedSet)): Exports == Implementation where

  EXPRR ==> Expression R

  Exports == FunctionSpace R

  Implementation == EXPRR add

      Rep := EXPRR

      out: (Polynomial R, List %, List %) -> OutputForm 
      out(p, kl, vl) == 
        ex := leadingMonomial(p)::%
        if reductum p = 0 
        then coerce(eval(ex, vl, kl))$Rep
        else coerce(eval(ex, vl, kl))$Rep _
             + out(reductum p, kl, vl)

      coerce(ex:%):OutputForm == 
        kl := kernels ex
        vl: List % := [subscript('x, [i::OutputForm])::Symbol::% for i in 1..#kl]
        ex1: % := subst(ex, kl, vl)$%
        kl1 := map(coerce(#1)$%, kl)$ListFunctions2(Kernel %, %)
        out(retract(ex1)@Polynomial(R), kl1, vl)

which provides a brilliant implementation of an extended Expression
domain that displays in distributed form. I think this wonderfully
demonstrates both the power of the Axiom language as well as
the power of collaborative development! :)

I have created a page on the Axiom wiki that demonstrates
Martin's idea.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxDistributedExpression=20

I also provided a simple coercion from types of Expression
to DistributedExpression.

Comments, improvements and extensions to the code would be
greatly appreciated!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Greetings!

Is the official release site

http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/DOWNLOADS/ 

?

If so, may I please request sortable file or symbolic link names so
that Debian can automatically tell me when its package is out of date?

I.e. 

ln -s axiom-Sept2005-src.tgz axiom-20050901-src.tgz

?

Thanks to all for your wonderful work!

Ok the following link should now work:

Well, output is easily changed. You did notice that the *real* power of
different representations is speed. Thus, my domain is rather cosmetics,
however useful it may be. We do agree that cosmetics is useful, I guess.

Hi,

Just wanted to send encouragements and thanks. I learned of axiom
through Timothy Daly's talk at the LSM Metz 2003. I never had the
occasion to use it until this week, and I found the "Basic Commands"
entry in the HyperDoc Top Level to be a *very* good idea. What I
wanted to do was listed up front there and in 2 minutes, I had already
closed Axiom, having gotten the result I wanted.

Take care,

-- 
Lionel

Changes http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RepAndPer/diff
--
Aldor programming philosophy from the point of view of it's
evolution from previous incarnations of the Axiom library
compiler, is described here:

http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap18.html

There is one construct in particular in Aldor that really
stands out - the concept of representation and it's opposite
(abstraction?). In Aldor these are formally denoted
by two very peculiar coercion operations: 'rep' and 'per'.

In older SPAD terms, rep and per can be written as the following
macros::

  macro {
        rep x == x @ % pretend Rep;
        per r == r @ Rep pretend %;
  )

The expression 'rep(x)' describes an object x of this domain but
treats it as belonging to a different domain 'Rep'.

The expression 'per(y)' describes an object y from the 'Rep' domain
which is to be treated as belonging to this domain. ('per' as in
the percent % symbol)

In looking through older SPAD code it is clear that these
combinations occur frequently and their encapsulation as 'rep'
and 'per' makes reading Aldor code much easier than SPAD.

Does anyone know of any formal programming language research
papers that describe the semantics of 'rep' and 'per' in a
general way? If this sort of mechanism is present in other
languages, what form does it take?

It seems to me that 'rep' and 'per' constitute the essence of the
peculiar object-oriented programming style pioneered by Axiom
and Aldor. But what are these constructs in formal (categorical)
terms?

Below is a first attempts to answer these questions -
comments, corrections and opinions would be most welcome!

<hr />

It seems appropriate to me to think of rep and per as forming
a pair of adjoint functors::

             rep
            ---->
   % domain       Rep domain
            <----
             per

'rep' is a "forgetful functor" that maps the abstract structure
(objects and operations) of this domain into it's internal
representation. It "forgets" about the abstract relationships.
The objects of the external domain however are viewed only in
terms of the relationships between objects. The image of this
domain under 'rep' in representation has its internal structure
exposed.

'per' on the other hand constructs abstract members of this
domain from the underlying representation. It encapsulates
the internal operations of the representation in terms of
the abstract structure of this domain.

domains must be thought of in terms of categories both in the
sense of category theory and in Axiom's sense of "category".
The appropriate categories usually have at least the structure
of a Cartesian closed category which they inherit from
Axiom's basic types constructors, record, union and mapping.
See discussion:
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TuplesProductsAndRecords

In terms of category theory there is a natural transformation,
called the 'unit', that partitions elements of the Rep domain
into classes (as an abstract quotient of the representation)::

  x --> rep(per(x))

and 'rep' is right adjoint of 'per'.

In category theoretic terms 'Rep' domain is some Cartesian closed
category, i.e. consisting of products (records), co-products
(unions) and exponentials (functions) over some basic set
of component domains. It's operations are formed freely from
the operations of it's components.

The implementation of the domain in terms of the representation
establishes a natural bi-jection between the operation of the
external domain and the operation of it's internal representation::

   x -> rep y    (representation)
  ------------
   per x -> y    (domain)

The book: "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists", by
Benjamin Pierce, MIT Press, 1991, is a good reference. See
especially section 2.4. Pierce gives an excellent example in
terms of definition of the 'List' constructor.

Theory for the working computer scientist." by Andrea Asperti and

Yes, you are right. As usual, I just wish we had more
documentation: both user documentation (how-to) and
conceptual documentation (why).

Axiom's approach to output as a coercion to the type OutputForm
is radically different than any other computer algebra system
that I know. There is an attempt also in Axiom to do the same
with input (InputForm and SExpressions etc.) This is a powerful
idea that depends centrally on the strong typing system.

Understanding how to use types and domains in Axiom is both
"90% of the problem" and "90% of the reasons why one might
want to use Axiom in the first place". We need to write more
about this ...

I wrote a short note about the concept of representation
in Aldor (which also applies to Axiom and SPAD)

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RepAndPer

I think that you are right that one of the main points
about different representations is the relative
computational efficiency of different implementations
for different purposes. But I think there is much more
to this concept and that the current Aldor and SPAD
syntax does not sufficiently highlight the important
place that it holds. The current syntax, i.e. 'rep'
and 'per' as macros and 'Rep' as a distinquished name
for a local domain, seems to treat representation on
a par with other programming constructs.

>=20

I just spent a couple of hours trying to add a new operation
called 'terms' to the DistributedExpression domain. The
idea was that it should return a List of Expressions in
analogy with the 'monomials' operator of POLY, but I kept
getting hung up on vague SPAD compiler messages and picky
details for explicitly specifying domains... After all this
time I still do not feel fluent in SPAD/Aldor but for some
reason I continue to admire it greatly when I see something
that works! :)

Yes, I do agree that "cosmetics" is useful. In fact I have
been know to claim that "notation is (almost) everything"
in mathematics and I think that applies equally to computer
algebra systems.

I agree. User comprehension is not merely a superficial convenience of
a CAS - it's a fundamental necessity.  UI design and formatting of
output are two components of this, and cannot be overlooked.  I think
there is a tendency for mathematical people to think only in terms of
the mathematics itself - a critical thing to remember, once in a while
anyway, is that correct mathematics is completely useless if it cannot
be used and built on, and the harder it is to understand it the less
useful it is in those regards.  So the best possible presentation of
results is of paramount importance, as is an incremental approach to
using the full power (and attendant complexity) of Axiom.

That's why I like the idea of building "user friendly" environments for
users, which operate pretty much as expected, but set up those
environments by making assumptions which are implicit in normal
operation explicit via the implementation of the environment.  This
lets people function more or less normally, but as they have a need for
more generality they can make fewer assumptions in their default
environment, and incrementally bring online the new syntax and
increased care needed for real correctness.

Cheers,
CY

Well, this is user interface and then there is output formatting
... these are not really the same thing. For example, requiring a
user to write

  x^2

and then seeing

  2
 x
            Type: Polynomial Integer

displayed on the screen is what I would call UI. Having Axiom
generate LaTeX output via

  )set output tex on

and getting

  $$
  x \sp 2
  \leqno(3)
  $$
             Type: Polynomial Integer

Aside: Wouldn't it make better sense if we got only LaTeX
formatted output when we set output tex on? Maybe the above
should be more like:

  \axiomtext{Loading C:/Program Files/axiom/mnt/windows/algebra/UNISEG.o
      for domain UniversalSegment}
  $$
  x \sp 2
  \leqno(3)
  $$
  \axiomtype{Polynomial Integer}

If Axiom did this it would be much easier to parse it's
output for applications like MathAction and TeXmacs.

-------

Having MathAction or TeXmacs display this graphically is
still UI.

On the other hand when you input

  (x+y)*(z+w)::Expression Integer

and Axiom replies

  (y + x)z + w y + w x
                       Type: Expression Integer

then the display of whatever internal representation is
used by Axiom for type 'Polynomial Integer' is controlled by
the implied coercion to the special type OutputForm. This is
really all that is different between the type Expression Integer
and Martin's new type DistributedExpression Integer. The
internal representation happens to be the same (but need not
be) but the function which provides coercion to OutputForm
has been replaced with one that causes Axiom to reply

  xz + xw + yz + yw
                       Type: DistributedExpression Integer

----------

The type OutputForm which doesn't actually show up here is
used internally when Axiom formats it's output for display.
Although this is certainly output formatting, I don't think
I want to call this a User Interface issue as such. The idea
that (y + x)z + w y + w x and  xz + xw + yz + yw can be both
be external representations of the same thing is more a matter
of mathematics than cosmetics.

I would take a stronger stand and say that some mathematics
is essentially impossible unless you have the right notation.
For example perhaps one reason that the Romans did not spend
much time doing algebra was that it was too much of a pain to
learn the multiple (iiix) by (cxx). :)

This is what Richard Fateman has called the "principle of
least surprize" applied to computer algebra systems. I think
that currently the Axiom interpreter fails rather badly on
this principle in quite a few situations. Very often is is
quite difficult to explain to a new user of Axiom why Axiom
produces the output that it does in certain cases because
the explanation necessarily involves some rather deep knowledge
of how Axiom operates. This is bad for new users and is one
of the things that makes Axiom better suited as a research
platform than for the casual weekend computer algebra user.

>=20

I think that this is an ideal that is very hard to achieve
(maybe impossible) but is certainly a goal to work towards.
One of the problems with computer algebra systems is that
they are trying to do something that (most) people already
find rather hard to do - not just multiplying 7*120. Often
they are learning the subject (mathematics) at the same time
as learning to use the computer system. That makes it at
least doubly hard.

Of course I should have written:

        the display of whatever internal representation is
  used by Axiom for type 'Expression Integer' is controlled by
  the implied coercion to the special type OutputForm.

The same applies for all types (domains) in Axiom. Each of them
must supply at least one function named 'coerce' with signatue

  coerce: % -> OutputForm

This function is called by the Axiom interpreter. And it can
be used explicitly like this for example:

(4) -> (a+b)*(c+d)::OutputForm

   (4)  (b + a)(d + c)
                                      Type: OutputForm

Notice that the expression '(a+b)*(c+d)' has not been
interpreted by Axiom in any mathematical sense. OutputForm
is just a way of generating output that "looks like"
mathematics.=20

I think that this attempt is doomed to fail. Still it may be useful, at least
for debugging.

No. There is enough written about it (in the Aldor User Guide). A short
introductory text is in the Axiom book.

If you send me your code and the error message you got (the latter for

NO, NO, NO. Good notation is important, and I'd agree if you'd say that
mathematics builds on good notation. But it's not nearly "almost everything".

What (good) notation provides is a means to make your ideas and proofs clear
and enable others to follow them. The idea comes before the notation. Often
even the proof comes before the notation.

Could you explain why you think this approach is "doomed
to fail"? To me it seems simply under developed in the
current version of Axiom. I don't see any conceptual problems
with extending the idea. So far I have found it quite
useful, for example in implementing the 'op()' operator
for manipulating parts of expressions. See

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/ManipulatingExpressions

?! I am rather shocked that you would make this claim! :(
I have read all of this material as well as all of the
papers and articles on this subject and still I think that
types and domains in Axiom are a big problem... and also
the main reason to use Axiom as I said above.

It seems to me that one of the reasons that Axiom is not
used as much and is not being developed as quick as Mathematica,
Maple and even Maxima is precisely because of the problem to
trying to understand and use strong typing in computer algebra
systems (the marketing and commercial reasons not withstanding).
In a sense, Axiom is/was an experiment in the application of
strongly typed programming languages in computer algebra and
to be quite honest and blunt, for the most part the experiment
seems to have failed. :(

My philosophical position is much more radical. I take the
strong "Whorfian" view

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Whorf

that language (in this case mathematical notation) largely
determines what and how we think about problems.

I doubt that "proof comes before notation" because I doubt
that rigoursly expressing a proof is even possible without
the proper notation. So you may "think" that you have a
proof until you try to write it down ... :)

Bill Page.

Hm. Maybe you are right there. I was thinking at domains like Polytope, where
the representation is not really available to axiom, or at a future Graph
domain. But you are right, in both cases it is probably possible to write a 

coerce: % -> InputForm

What exactly do you think is a problem? I do admit that improving the quality
of the explanations in the Axiom Book would be good, however difficult. Same
for the Aldor User Guide, which is more technical and more detailed. But I
wouldn't write *more* about it. It's too much quantity!

Look at MuPad, which works well. It has (nearly exactly) the same type
hierarchy as axiom -- still it sells. The difference is mainly the language of
MuPad, which is not statically typed, in contrast to Aldor/Spad.

No, most of it has been transformed into MuPad. However, I dare say that Aldor
is superiour to MuPad's language.

I don't disagree, it's probably only a matter of the right wording :-)

I believe (and I think that I know from experience) that sometimes I have the
right idea (intuition), and then I gradually improve notation, sharpen the
idea, improve notation, the idea makes it into a proof, improve notation, the
proof becomes more readable...

I did not claim that "expressing" or "communicating" a proof is (always)
possible without the right notation. (sometimes, it may be, given the right
audience)

I think the jury is still out on strongly typed issues - such systems
(including Axiom, in some ways) tend to be designed by experts for
experts, and thus it is not surprising that in terms of "market share"
they don't do as well.  I suspect core technical merit has little to do
with such issues, which is quite unfortunate.

I think it is becoming increasingly clear that the Axiom/Aldor issue
needs to be resolved soon.  If serious work with Aldor is to go forward
and not result in fragmenting the Axiom community, the licensing issues
need to be sorted out.  And it sounds from what I've been hearing that
we really, really should be using Aldor if at all possible.

If MuPad is using a lot of the ideas that went into Axiom, a) that's
good and b) we need to do some things significantly different/better
than MuPad to attract a userbase.  Personally, I think this means
trying seriously to merge computer algebra with proof systems, and
creating a computational environment were people can know and prove
that an answer given by the computer is correct.  Just as security is
now the great need in operating system and network design, I think
verifiable correctness and trustable answers and the great frontier for
CAS.  Feature sets have matured quite a bit over the years, so
competing on features isn't enough (IMHO).  If we do that, it's hard to
avoid becoming just another CAS, with a few advantages and a few
disadvantages compared to other systems.  The net result will be people
sticking with what they know. (Maple, Mathematica, what have you.)

There seem to have been a number of efforts to tie Axiom to proof
systems over the years.  I would like to learn more about those
efforts, why they did or didn't work, and why they weren't integrated
into mainstream Axiom. If the difficulties can be overcome, this seems
to me to be the way to make Axiom a) something new and different from
the user point of view and b) the logical choice for a major
theoretical mathematics journal to incorporate into it's system.  Past
archives could be converted to Axiom pamphlet files (when it makes
sense to do so) and we could see if Axiom is up to tracking
mathematical developments over a couple of decades.

Anyway, just some thoughts, for whatever they may be worth.

Cheers,
CY

P.S.  Hey Tim, are there any folks at CMU that are into this kind of
stuff?  Sounds like something that might appeal to them.

That battle is raging right now in the web development arena, and 
"strongly typed" and "static" languages are taking a beating by dynamic 
environments like Ruby, Python, Perl and PHP. Let's face it ... people 
who program for a living like dynamic languages and hate static ones. If 
the "industry" couldn't hire thousands of inexpensive C programmers, the 
language would have died out except as an "assembler" for dynamic 
language interpreters and the Linux kernel. :)

Well, in the for-profit world, I use Derive. It does everything I need 
at a fraction of the price of the others. MuPad isn't really "free" as 
in either freedom or beer. In the free world, I mostly use Maxima, and 
then only on Linux. Maxima is pretty much useless to me, though, unless 
I also have TeXmacs to typeset my math and mix in text with it.

As to verifiable correctness, a similar situation has occurred in the 
numerical world with such things as interval arithmetic and floating 
point computations based on provable properties of the arithmetic. What 
happens is that the computational cost and complexity of the 
implementation are significant and so it doesn't get done. "Cheap and 
good enough" trumps "expensive and perfect" unless there *isn't* a "good 
enough".

I think you may be seeing the same sort of thing trying to pair CAS with 
proof engines. In a way, your challenge may be worse than the challenge 
of getting verifiable numerical calculations adopted, because both CAS 
and theorem proving rapidly get into NP-Complete and NP-Hard problems, 
whereas the worst-case numerical algorithms in common use are N**4. 
They're both nice dreams for computationalists, though. :)

There are many problems most of which we have discussed to a
greater or lesser extent here over the last two years:

#1 Understanding how to apply the programming language concept
   of 'types' (as in Pascal) to mathematical 'domains' (as in
   Bourbaki and category theory). Are types and domains the
   same thing? When to define Axiom categories?

#2 Understanding how and when to use representations (Rep) and
   the role of primitive domains like record, union and mapping.
   How is this related to object-oriented programming concepts?

#3 Understanding the structure of Axiom's more than 1,000 existing
   domains and categories. Lack of adequate documentation. Difficulty
   of navigating and browsing such a large structure. Difficulty in
   relating design choices to contemporary mathematical concepts.
   In spite of it's already large size, only a relatively small part
   of mathematics is implemented.

#4 Dealing with unexpected and sometimes complex behaviour of the
   Axiom interpreter -- mainly it's heuristics relating to guessing
   types. Differences between the Axiom "interpreter language" and
   the Axiom "library language".

#5 Differences between the SPAD language and the Aldor language.

#6 ...

Actually I mostly agree with you about this. Quantity does not
substitute for quality and quality is more difficult. For example,
over the last few years the participants of axiom-developer list
here have probably exchanged a much greater quantity of text than
contained in the original 1,000+ page Axiom Book (from which we
have plans to create 4 or 5 new volumes). In general, as Axiom
documentation the quality and coverage of the resulting online
archive might be considered rather "low". But on MathAction we
have (gradually) collecting and re-writing some of the material
that might have some lasting relevance and quality. When I say
"write more", I am thinking mostly of improving the "quality"
in this way.

Could you explain what you mean by "statically typed"? I don't
think Aldor and Spad could be said to be statically typed either.
I agree that in contrast to Aldor and Spad, Mupad is not "strongly
typed". And this is exactly my point. 

The "type hierarchy" in MuPad was more or less directly grafted on
to MuPad in version 2. Version 1 of MuPad looked almost identical
to Maple release 4 and had essentially no concept of type at all.
But the structure of these programming languages have diverged
greatly in MuPad versions 2 and 3 and Maple from versions 7, 8, 9
and 10. Maple by deliberate design has no concept of type at all
(the "assume" facility notwithstanding). Both MuPad and Maple
are taking very different paths towards a more complete "object-
orientation", and neither are really similar to Axiom.

Yes, MuPad does "sell" although considerably behind Mathematica
and Maple. Originally MuPad was open source but since version 2
the kernel software has a proprietary license. Like Maple, most
of the algebra source code is "open" and accessible to the end
user but licensing and copyright remains an issue. I think MuPad
would be doing much better now if it had remained entirely open
source. And if that had happened we might be discussing MuPad
instead of Axiom right here and now. :)

MuPad's implementation of Axiom's type hierarchy is described
here:

Axioms, Categories and Domains
Klaus Drescher
January 2002 Automath Technical Report No 1
http://research.mupad.de/doc/31/eng/domainref.pdf

Here are some highlights:

In the section "Categories":

http://research.mupad.de/doc/31/eng/domainref_se12.html#x14-230004

See especially "Figure 4: Graph of the Categories of the Integers".
This graph is nearly identical to part of the graph inside the
front cover of the Axiom Book.

Axiom is referenced explicitly in the section titled
"General Nonsense?":

http://research.mupad.de/doc/31/eng/domainref_se17.html#x20-310007

"Most of the concepts in the constructors are based on ideas in
AXIOM, see [7]. Many new algorithms have been implemented in
AXIOM for the first time because there the user has the algebraic
structures handy that he can use for his problem, independent of
their representation. All objects in AXIOM are strictly typed.
This is not possible in MuPAD because the MuPAD language is not
strictly typed.

A debatable feature of AXIOM is the automatic type conversion:
the system tries to determine the type of the user's input
on entry, i.e., to convert untyped expressions directly into
domain elements. In MuPAD the user currently has to explicitly
convert the type "by hand". It is, of course, in some cases
easier for the user not to have to give the type. On the other
hand, it is often difficult to determine the type of an
expression that the user has in mind. For this AXIOM uses
time-consuming and error-susceptible heuristics."

    System. Springer, 1992.

In "The Constructors of the MuPAD Library":

http://research.mupad.de/doc/31/eng/domainref_se18.html

Notice in particular even specific details of Axiom's category
structure are implemented:

I disagree. In spite of what MuPad has borrowed from Axiom, it
seems to me that so far MuPad has implemented only a small part
of the original concept of the Axiom designers. I think that
this is probably intentional on the part of the MuPad developers
and is at least in part due to the perception that the "Axiom
Experiment" failed to demonstrate the utility of it's strong
type system.

The situation is similar with statically typed programming
languages in general. For example, hardly anyone writes in
Pascal any more. But there is still a lot of research going
on in strongly typed languages such as Haskell and Ocaml.

I agree. In many respects Spad and Aldor anticipated many of
the features implemented in Haskell and Ocaml. And they are
strongly motivated by abstract mathematical concepts. MuPad
(and Maple and Mathematica) on the other hand has not yet
shed it's origins as what Tim Daly referred to as the
"engineering approach to computer algebra".

We need to define carefully what we mean by "stongly typed"
programming language. I think this article does a good job:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language

and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datatype

"Static typing as opposed to dynamic typing. In a static type
system, type annotations are associated with variable names
rather than values. It is thus possible for the compiler to
prove via static analysis that a program contains no type
errors."

"Strong guarantees about the run-time behavior of a program
before program execution, whether provided by static analysis
or another mechanism."

So one issue is really statically typed versus dynamically
typed.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typed_and_untyped_languages

The C language is statically typed but not strong. Haskell and
Ocaml are strongly static typed. I think SPAD and Aldor are also
strong static typed languages. (However I am not so sure about
the 'pretend' construct in these languages which looks something
like a type-cast in C.) Languages like Python, Lisp, Maple and
are dynamnically typed. I think that MuPad is also dynamically
typed.

Comments?

Bill Page.

I should also mention that the issue of 'type' in languages (like
Spad and Aldor), where types are first-class objects (values), i.e.
can be computed dynamically and returned as results of functions,
considerably complicates the notion of "static" versus "dynamic".
However I think the adjective "strong" still clearly applies.

>From http://www.aldor.org

"From a technical point of perspective, Aldor is a type-complete,
strongly-typed, imperative programming language with a two-level
object model of categories and domains (similar to the concept of
interfaces and classes in Java). Types and functions are first
class entities allowing them to be constructed and manipulated
within Aldor programs just like any other value. Pervasive use of
dependent types allows static checking of dynamic objects and
provides object-oriented features such as parametric polymorphism."

Can some Aldor expert expand on this? For example, can functions be created,
modified, and compiled and called all at run time? (People used to do code
modification on assembly languages and may still do, but the practice is I think
no longer promoted, if not outright banned.)

Thanks.

Just to provide a better balance of these discussions, here are some quotations
taken from research papers involving Axiom published during 1999 to 2001. Note
that these authors had used other computer algebra systems for the SAME research
earlier. I am including three representatives from major research areas of
computer algebra:  abstract mathematics, applied computation, and comparison of
algorithms. For details, see the original articles.

(1) Ito calculus is a formalism to study continuous random
processes. Kendall [1] wrote:

"This article reports on progress in the implementation of Ito
calculus in the powerful and innovative computer algebra package
AXIOM, in the context of a decade of previous implementations and
applications.  It is shown how the elegant algebraic structure
underlying the expressive and effective formalism of \ito
calculus can be implemented directly in AXIOM using the package's
programmable facilities for 'strong typing' of computational
objects.  An application is given of the use of the implementation to
provide calculations for a new proof, based on stochastic
differentials, of the Mardia-Dryden distribution from statistical
shape theory."

And from the summary (the earlier implementations are in Reduce and
Mathematica):

"In this article we have described how the innovative features
of AXIOM can be used to exploit the elegant formalism of the
\ito calculus, producing an implementation (Kendall 1998a) of
Itovsn3 substantially improving on its predecessors (Kendall
1991a, b, 1993b)."


(2) When algorithms for computing three-loop (Feynman) diagrams in Heavy
Quark Effective Theory (HQET) using integration-by-parts recurrence
relations are implemented in both Reduce and Axiom, there is substantial
increase in speed in Axiom.  Grozin reported [2]:

"I also re-implemented it in Axiom
[25].  All expressions involved are linear combinations of basis
integrals with coefficients which are rational functions of $d$.  It
is convenient to use Axiom Vector domain, which has all the necessary
operations.  This makes intermediate expressions shorter than in the
case when multivariate rational functions are used for entire
expressions, because, typically, not all basis integrals are
accompanied by every possible denominator.  The amount of GCD
calculations is thus reduced.  This improvement can be, in principle,
back-propagated to the REDUCE implementation by using matrices.
However, working with matrices in REDUCE is awkward, because there are
no local matrix variables, and no easy way for a function to return a
matrix.  I made no systematic benchmarking; one test set of 9375
recurrence relations took 2019 seconds in REDUCE and 350 seconds in
Axiom."

(3) In choosing a system to compare different algorithms for computations with
triangular sets of polynomial equations using Gr\"obner basis (GB), Aubry and
Maza \cite[p.~137]{Aubry} selected Axiom for the following reasons:

"We thought that the AXIOM computer algebra system (Jenks and Sutor,
1992; Broadbery et al., 1994), with its strongly typed and
object-oriented language, is convenient to satisfy our first
requirement.  We defined categories corresponding to the different
properties of triangular sets, packages and domains for the common
data structures and sub-routines.  Furthermore, AXIOM (version 1.2) is
connected with GB, the very powerful Gr\"obner engine developed by
Faug\`ere (1994).  This allowed us to run the non-trivial Gr\"obner
basis computations that are required in order to satisfy our other two
requirements."

Well, to be fair, I think it's a question of what the programmer is trying to 
accomplish.  For quick prototyping and getting ones ideas into workable for 
as rapidly as possible, I agree dynamic languages are probably the tool of 
choice (e.g., Lisp.)  For doing something as correctly as possible, however, 
I'm not so sure.  I think the CAS field is a bit unique currently in being 
really interested in correctness.  (Or at least, some parts of it.)

Right - Axiom doesn't have enough mindshare right now to challenge even Maxima 
in "popularity."  I would argue that this isn't necessarily a bad thing - I 
would expect Axiom to be less of a "phenomenon" until it reaches a point 
where it is competitive, which will take longer when developing for 
correctness is the first concern.

I'm hoping open source will allow us to short circuit those economic 
limitations to some extent.  If we can create a really good system, perhaps 
we can move the "good enough" yardstick further out.

Well, dreams are what great accomplishments start as :-).  I think both 
verifiable numerical computations and smart integration with proof systems 
could go a long way towards making Axiom not just another entry in the CAS 
market but a fundamentally new type of software - maybe even a "killer app" 
in relevant mathematical and scientific areas.  

Of course, I'm not really qualified to have dreams like this yet :-).  Maybe 
after a few years of studying up on the issue I'll know why it's not worth 
doing :-/.

Cheers,
CY

Dear William, *

although I know that Axioms approach has *not* failed I wouldn't qualify work
from 2001 as recent. A lot has changed since then, especially regarding MuPad.

Again, if I weren't convinced of Axiom, I wouldn't put that much of an effort
into it. However, A LOT OF WORK HAS TO BE DONE. 

Martin

Dear Bill,

unfortunately, I have too little time to answer everything... Especially some
of #1 to #6 need more thinking before I answer.

Hm, I thought that static typing means that the type of a variable is known at
compile time, which is clearly the case in Aldor/Spad but not necessarily in
the Axiom interpreter. As far as I know, it is not the case at all in MuPad.

I don't really know what strongly typed would mean. According to wikipedia,
it's meaning depends on the person using it :-)

I find current MuPad quite similar to Axiom. There are domains, categories and
similar stuff, but it seems that Axiom handles this things a lot stricter than
MuPad.

Well, I admit that I don't know MuPad well enough to judge. In any case, I'm
only talking about the design, not the amount of stuff actually implemented...

I think Martin Rubey's and William Sitt's contributions to
Axiom are outstanding! Their dedication and the work of
other people here clearly demonstrates that Axiom has not
"failed", yet... Although I said that I thought the Axiom
experiment was (for the most part) a failure, I should have
qualified that as applying most directly to the commercial
version of Axiom that was for a brief time a direct competitor
to Maple and Mathematica. About the current open source
effort: I agree completely with Martin's statement: "if
I weren't convinced of Axiom, I wouldn't put much effort
into it".

I think William Sitt's quotations are encouraging. Also we
should not forget the enormous effort that was put into the
implementation of the current Axiom library itself. This
library contains over 1,000 domains and categories that interact
in complex and apparently correct manner. This is a major
accomplishment and it's all written in SPAD. Although I said
earlier that Axiom's library covers only a small part of
mathematics, to be fair I should also point out that in scope,
if not always in depth, it covers much more mathematics than
either Maple, Mathematica or MuPad.

So in that respect the Axiom experiment in applying a strongly
typed programming language in computer algebra has not been
a failure. But there is the larger sense in which the medical
idiom: "The operation was a success but the patient died anyway
... " almost applies to Axiom. I think Axiom is in a critical
state. As open source software it can survive in this state
for a long time, but to advance in needs a lot more support.
It is quite disappointing to me that during that last two years
of fairly intense effort on our part, Axiom has not been
adopted by any major university program or research institute
and we are still struggling to find any kind of substantial
support. :(

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Bill and others,

	even if I was very quiet, due to an work overload with 'regular
busines', I might add to this philosophy discussion that I _do_ need a
strongly typed language! I had much discussion with the Marn le Valle
group about Mupad. Their argument is that there is already now to few
development power to come up with compeeting systems/packages (say in the
combinatorial/Hopf algebra world). And combinat for Mupad is quite
impressive, collecting algorithms from SYMMETRICA/SCHUR and other
packages.

To add types to Maple needs lots of (very slow and painstaking) code which
does not do any math for you. Furthermore its error prone.

I have no experience with Mupad, but it seems to have (some of) the same
deficiencies as has Maple. Only very clever data formats (keeping type
informations, as in the combinat package) may help, which poses the burden
of typing once more to the user.

My experience with any CAS (including the terrible but brilliantly fast
SCHUR) is that one needs a good start (local Guru). AXIOM has its problems
with the steep learning curve for the beginner. Thats what stoped some of
my more realistics approches to my problems, but will not stop me to try
to learn more AXIOM programming to do it.

I had some time ago a discussion with Maple protagonists in .de and they
assured, after being questioned, that Maple tries to pursue engineers,
studendts etc. Hence they try to approch large (in quantity) groups, since
there they can make a deal there. Scientific achievements or features
needed to implement them are not on the priority list. AXIOM users seem to
be of such a kind that they have problems which do not fit into the
Maple/Mathematica standard solution set. These are ambitious people PhD
students etc. So I think it will take more time unless these people become
multipliers and teach onw studentds AXIOM.

Meanwhile I will stop typing in philosophy `nonsense` and try to do some
more science and AXIOM programming... ;-))

People certainly still do this, for example in lisp, Python and
Haskell.

I can't speak about Aldor specifically (yet) but I am sure that
it is possible.

In Axiom it is possible. See for example section 9.50 MakeFunction
in the Axiom book. There are numerous other examples of this in
Axiom.

In

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/206InterpreterCodeGenerationFailedForFunc=
tio
nReturningAType

I find that in Aldor at least it is possible to treat types as
values and return them as the result of functions. Both the
Axiom interpret and SPAD fail to compile my simple example.

But having defined the function tt2 in Aldor like this:

#include "axiom.as";
testtype2(): with {
    tt2: (Integer) -> Type;
} =3D=3D add {
    tt2(x:Integer):Type =3D=3D {
      x=3D0 =3D> Integer;
      Float;
      }
    }

How can I use it in Axiom in a useful manner? For example,
if I write:

  (1) -> n:tt2(0)

Axiom says:

  "Category, domain or package constructor tt2 is not available"

which is true of course because it is 'testtype2' which is
the name of a **domain**. But even if I this:

 (2) -> intx :=3D tt2(0)

   (2)  Integer
                            Type: Type
 (3) -> a:intx

   intx is not a valid type.

---------

I get what seems to be a peculiarly inconsistent result.

Any ideas?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Perhaps here is a clue:

(2) -> I:=tt2(0)

   (2)  Integer
                                                                   Type:
Type
(3) -> x:I

   I is not a valid type.
(3) -> J:=Integer

   (3)  Integer
                                                                 Type:
Domain
(4) -> x:J
                                                                   Type:
Void
(5) -> x:=1

   (5)  1
                                                                Type:
Integer

-----------

So my tt2(0) function is returning something from the domain
'Type'. But in (3) above the type of the result is 'Domain'.

This makes my head spin a little! :)

How can a write a function that returns something of type
'Domain'?

Or am I really terribly confused about all this?

Bill Page.

Here's a sample of the kind of things developers from the 
"agile"/"extreme programming" school of thought have to say on the 
subject of "static vs. dynamic":

http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=4639

Of course, the "general programming/scripting language" world is very 
different from the mathematical rigor world where Axiom and other CAS 
and proof engines live. My belief  is that the purpose of programming is 
to deliver high-quality software as defined by the user. The user of a 
web application, like on-line banking, has a much different view of what 
high quality is than a user of a CAS or proof engine ... *and* both are 
much different than the definition of quality when the user is a 
*developer* of on-line banking software or the user is a *developer* of 
a numerical package, CAS or proof engine.

But ... well ... Axiom has a Lisp core. And the Lisp 
compiler/interpreter has a C core. So does the Gnu Compiler Collection. :)

I think it's important to automate as much as is possible of *every* 
knowledge worker's job. This is the computer as "intelligence 
amplifier". The job of a mathematician (leaving aside the important 
distinction between theoretical and applied!) is to get correct results. 
So as a sometimes applied mathematician, I think the combination of CAS 
and proof engine is a good idea, and the discipline of strong static 
typing and a complier that can catch lots of bugs in one project while 
I'm working on another project makes my job easier, not harder.

On the other hand, as a practicing performance engineer and capacity 
planner, there are times when I have to grind through gigabytes of 
performance data and do a queueing model. Then I want a programming 
environment that allows me to bang out a quick solution that executes 
efficiently and gives me visualizations that tells me what's going on. 
For that, I use Perl and R and, increasingly, relational databases. I 
could probably replace R with Axiom, but I'm guessing I'd still need the 
Perl component. 

I've done a little "number crunching" in Derive. It works surprisingly 
well, actually -- if my colleagues were mathematicians or physicists 
rather than managers and software engineers, I'd do all but the largest 
problems in a CAS, provided it had a good typesetting engine like 
TeXmacs. Derive isn't all that bad at typesetting, but it's nowhere near 
as "pretty" as TeXmacs with an Axiom or Maxima session.

Well ... I don't know ... have you looked at the Maxima road map 
recently? They've been at 5.9.1 for what seems like ages, and what they 
want in 6.0 is huge! Axiom, Maxima and Reduce are the old war horse CAS. 
Derive was born on a TRS-80, grew into a strong adolescent on DOS and 
now runs on Windows. I don't know too much about Maple or Mathematica; I 
"almost" learned Maple but it was way too slow on a 25 MHz Motorola 
88100 with 32 MB of RAM for any practical use.

(Yes, Derive really was born on a TRS-80, a 64 kilobyte Z80 machine with 
a cassette I/O subsystem.) :)

Might I suggest heading over to this web site:

The MathAction / Axiom front page is exactly what you need to create 
passionate users!

Well ... if it's any consolation, the core of what Google does very well 
is a singular value decomposition. Somebody besides the 
military-industrial complex finally got rich with computational linear 
algebra. :) Spreadsheets ... been done. Word processing ... been done. 
Web 2.0 ... being done. Searching, the semantic web ... been done.

How about biotechnology, though?

Oh, it's worth doing ... my dreams when I got out of grad school (1974) 
were to own a computer capable of algorithmic composition and synthesis 
of music, and to have a computer prove the programs I wrote for a living 
were correct. One out of two ain't bad! :) It's worth doing ... so is 
solving the halting problem. :)

Ah, but how many people actually *need* a CAS, as opposed to "enjoy 
working with a CAS and have the money to afford Mathematica?" I don't 
think R has made a serious dent in the profits of the folks who sell 
S-Plus, despite the fact that the two environments are "fraternal 
twins". As I've noted before, I do number crunching for a living. I 
"enjoy working with a CAS and have the money to afford Derive." But if R 
and Perl weren't free, I wouldn't have them available.

Oh yeah ... does Axiom build and execute under CygWin?

Agreed, the word "recent" was an editing omission when I gave the years instead.
But the point is that with a system as complicated and specialized as Axiom,
there are people who still find it "better" than the other systems (some perhaps
equally complicated and specialized and some not) for the same projects. So I
think for those who are (were?) willing to spent the effort in learning several
CAS (including Axiom), they found it better. Obviously, people who only casually
use any CAS may find some easier than others for the purpose they have in mind
and that is certainly enough reason for THEM to praise one and condemn others
based on that experience. But for these casual users (I count myself as only a
casual user of Axiom---a reason I only supplied quotations from others---but a
much more heavy user of Mathematica, and not even a casual user of Maple), their
comments should not be regarded as in depth reviews.

You are correct. I think Axiom failed commercially because not enough effort was
put into organizing its users (the Friends of Axiom club never got to a critical
mass state) and because there are only very few research mathematicians (only in
the thousands worldwide) and even fewer who use CAS as a research tool in the
1990's when Axiom become commercialized. Even now, those who use a CAS for
teaching and occasionally as a symbolic calculator for research far outnumber
those who regularly uses a CAS as research tool, which in turn far outnumber
those who develop packages for CAS.  I am not sure if it is possible to enlarge
the Axiom user base to include the first two groups. Efforts have been made by
Jenks and others to use Axiom for courses (such as linear algebra) but support
was not there. 

The Axiom community has an opportunity to have a fresh beginning. But if one
looks at the number of "bugs" in IssueTracker, it is clear that the highest
priority would be to fix these first, because these bugs are "unexpected", some
even to the developers. We are at a stage of discovering and identifying these
problems and very far from fixing most of these. Martin has put in a lot of
effort in this respect and I wish I had his skills to track the (algebra)
issues. We are also spending a lot of efforts to keep up with new upgrades in
support systems and operating systems. I think that type of effort would widen
the initial user base but need not necessarily be able to keep them for long
unless the "bugs" are fixed.

Axiom has always been a "learn on your own" system. There is only ONE book on
axiom, where as there are probably hundreds on the 3M's.  But I don't see any of
the former gurus wanting to write similar texts for the more general audience,
and the reason is a "catch 22": Axiom has never been tried in the classroom (I
could be wrong and would be very happy to hear about counterexamples). So no one
has such experience to write about, and without textbook, no one would want to
try.  (I made a few attempts to teach a course using Axiom, but it did not
materialize because of low expected enrollment: who would want to learn an
"unheard of" CAS when everyone else is using the 3M's?) It seems such a text
need only involve a rudimentary portion of Axiom commands, say, sufficient for a
calculus course (so algebra, plotting, calculus and maybe some ODEs, especially
numerical solvers).  Perhaps we can make a cooperative effort to write one
chapter each. But first, we should identify the scope of the text, carefully
choose examples, and even exercises, and organize the contents. In such a text,
we should avoid the computer jargons (such as category, domains, strong types),
perhaps only use the "Any" domain, or suppress the Type and Autoload messages as
defaults. The Wiki environment is a perfect setting for such a cooperative
effort, and thanks to the tremendous dedicated effort by Bill Page, the Axiom
community can easily use this highly interactive web interface. 

This effort can be done in parallel (if only we had enough time and manpower)
with efforts to fix the algebra bugs. Kai has done substantial work on GUI. So
by the time the new text gets published, Axiom may be in a form that is usable
in teaching.

The documentation of existing algebra library is, in some sense, of lower
priority (IMHO). By this I mean retroactively filling in the missing parts in
the pamphlet files. It may be done as bugs are fixed, but a systematic effort
would require a lot of people-years ("man-years" is probably an equivalent
term!) It is one thing to give just the syntax for "integrate" and quite another
to explain how and why the results are obtained. Mathematicians with sufficient
knowledge to do the job are top researchers who would be unlikely to spend time
on this (not to mention that there are only a handful of them). Documentation
also requires digging deep into the design philosophy at the time these packages
were developed, for which little record exists. It belongs to CAS archaeology.

New research areas are probably the easiest to develop as those developing these
presumably can "learn on their own". Surprisingly, I have developed several
packages without getting into the "bugs". Perhaps the compiler language is more
precise and the strong type enforces correct function calls (satisfying the
unstated assumptions of the calls). I recall vaguely that I did get into design
issues which could have made developing those packages easier, but there were
always ways to "get around" --- certainly I found such "tricks' very
unappealing, but most of the time, after I understood things better, it was my
lack of understanding in the first place that caused the problems. Someone like
Manuel would not have encountered these problems at all, but then, Manuel was a
full time employee on the project in those days (plus he was extremely smart and
fast). I am sure that any new comer to Axiom as a developer would have to go
through similar pains (unless (s)he is of the same calibre as Manuel). Only
those willing to take the pains get the gains.

Axiom was "abandoned" twice, once by IBM and then by NAG. The second time was
especially devastating in that a working piece of software was taken apart and
some of its foundations removed. So it will take a few years to rebuild (like
New Orleans after Katrina and Rita). Until it can stand on its feet again, I
don't expect it can catch up with the 3M's in popularity. Another blow to Axiom
may be Aldor, which provides a more powerful language, so cutting edge
researchers moved to Aldor. But Aldor, like Axiom, will not enjoy the kind of
popularity as the 3M's, for the same reasons. It is our job to revive Axiom and
build on it, and if Aldor will never be open sourced, to compete with Aldor. So
far, even though Aldor provides a better language in terms of convenience of
programming, I am not yet convinced it is a more powerful or even more
expressive language (but of course, every computer is just as powerful as a
Turing machine ... and I am not saying convenience does not count).

But I should follow Bertfried Fauser: 

> stop typing in philosophy `nonsense` and try to do some

which, for now, is finishing a joint paper on Enumeration of Rota-Baxter Words
with Li Guo from Rutgers University at Newark. The long-term plan is to develop
a more intrinsic algebra hierarchy in Axiom using operator algebras, which, as
vector spaces, have canonical basis related to Rota-Baxter Algebras.

Sure, hackers and virus authors, too. But I am asking the question on an algebra
code level.

Thanks, but MakeFunction only turns an expression into a function by enabling
evaluation. So in this sense, sure a new function is created, much like defining
a new function in the interpreter. What I meant (sorry I wasn't clear) was to
take an existing library function, say a simple one like "inc" which adds 1 to
the argument, modify the code and create FROM THAT CODE a new function "incBy2"
(or for that matter, use the same function name "inc") that adds 2 to its
argument (note, not rewriting from scratch "incBy2", and not implementing
"incBy2" USING "inc" twice, but by modifying existing code, changing where "1"
is, to "2" in the code itself), have that function compiled, and executed, all
without leaving the interpreter or Axiom (or, Aldor). The crucial thing I am
asking is "code-modification" because that is the real meaning, as I understand
it, of "constructed and manipulated [Types and functions] ... just like any
other value".  Similarly, the "curry" type functions in Axiom do not "modify"
code and is a variant of MakeFunction. Can Aldor manipulate types and functions
much like Lisp (or Scheme) does? In principle, this is easy, if the code is
treated as a string, and if the format structure and language syntax are known;
so the question is not whether this is "possible", but whether this is
"available" as a feature of the Aldor language, that the code string can be
returned, manipulated, edited, and sent back to the compiler to get a new or
modified function. In Axiom, I would imagine one has to go the relevant NRLIB,
look at the code.lsp, and create a new version of it, create the corresponding
.o file to make this "possible". I don't consider that as "available".

Thanks, Bill, for your input. (I see you are experimenting with Types as
values).

William

Andrea,

I'm Tim Daly, lead developer on Axiom, a free, open source computer
algebra system.

I've recently discovered KFormula which I understand is a part of 
KOffice. I'm interested in the question of using KFormula as a front
end to our computer algebra system. Is there an API document?

The digging continues, and to my surprise there is a considerable body
of research on these issues.  Just for openers, I've stumbled across
several lisp implementations of unit/dimensional concepts, a Phd thesis
on incorporating units/dimensions into programming, and a paper about
an attempt to teach the formal Z language about units!  Yikes.  Quite a
bit of homework to do, so I may fall off the radar screen a bit while I
try to adsorb at least some of this.  (Plus, my home internet will be
off for quite a while, so that won't help either.)  If nothing else,
I'll try to leave a good bibtex file behind to help someone more
competent than myself.  Never assume anything will be simple!

Dr. Sit has been very helpful with his comments, and I wish to thank
him for his generosity.  Definite progress has been made but clearly I
need to familiarize myself with the work out there on this subject
before I will be competent to make further revisions.

In the interests of full disclosure, I should point out the email
address "smustudent1" is actually no longer correct - I haven't been a
student at SMU for several years.  The choice was a rather unfortunate
one - I assumed the Yahoo address would not live beyond my
undergraduate years.  Oops.  I actually have a day job that has nothing
to do with CASs, so unlike most folks here I'm a hobbyist rather than
an academic.  I do have a B.S. in Physics, a B.A. in Mathematics, and a
Masters in Materials Science, but I'm not currently active in academia.
 While it would be fun to get into this from an academic standpoint I
doubt the funding would ever be available, or the interest from a
research standpoint.

Anyway, just wanted to let y'all know the effort continues!

Cheers,
CY

Interesting. If that were so easy, it would be possible to ask a type 
for the functions it implements.

Aldor allows something like

#include "aldor"
#include "aldorio"
Dom: with {
   foo: % -> Boolean;
} == add {
   foo(x: %): Boolean == true;
}

import from Dom;
if Dom has with {foo: % -> Boolean} then {
	stdout << "foo is there" << newline;
} else {
	stdout << "foo is missing" << newline;
}

However, I cannot, for example, write a function that returns a list of 
names of functions implemented in Dom. (That is the current knowledge I 
have.) And, of course, I see no way of morphing the result of "foo" to 
"false" without writing a new function. I am not aware of
a language construct that invokes the compiler during the runtime of a 
program. (The compiler might not even present on the target machine.)

tt2 returns a domain of type "Type". So in order to be useful it would 
be necessary to know which functions it exports. However, one cannot 
look into Type. Your function tt2 would perhaps be more interesting if 
its return type were a category with some neat functionality. For 
example, replace Type above by ArithmeticType. Now, at least you know 
what functions you could call on values of type tt2(0). Though you would 
probably still need functions to coerce a known value into tt2(0) and back.

I have the impression that the result of (2) is misleading. Axiom prints 
"Integer" and its type is correctly "Type". This is, of course, 
different from the real Integer domain whose type is

Integer: Join(IntegerNumberSystem, ConvertibleTo String, OpenMath) with
     random   : % -> %
       ++ random(n) returns a random integer from 0 to \spad{n-1}.
     canonical
       ++ mathematical equality is data structure equality.
     canonicalsClosed
       ++ two positives multiply to give positive.
     noetherian
       ++ ascending chain condition on ideals.
     infinite
       ++ nextItem never returns "failed".

The "Integer" from (2) is the same as MyInt in

MyInt: with == Integer;

it has no exports. I am not really sure whether

MyInt: Type == Integer;

should be allowed to compile. Who could tell just from the left side of 
the == sign whether MyInt is a domain or a category?

Exactly. It has been a long standing (but lost) request (I believe from me) that
Axiom constructors (that include category, domain and packages, but not the
developers :-)) allow query of their arguments. It is useful, for example, to be
able to distinguish whether a field is a quotient field of some integral domain
or just a field to make codes more efficient. The request was not acted upon
because at the time (around 1990 +/- 3 years?), effort was concentrated on
developing the Aldor (A#) compiler, which promised to solve such problems.

In other words, if I understand the example, you can't list unless you already
know?

Listing functions in a domain is not a simple question in Axiom. Functions can
be inherited from parent constructors or exported as new. It also depends on in
what form you want the list. Surely, by doing a ")show Dom" (this is in the
interpreter: I am not aware of any compiler equivalent) you get that list. So
are you simply asking to be able to assign the output of ")show Dom" to a string
variable? Tim may be able to provide such a general assignment construct?

That is what I was asking: code modification. Like you, I also interpret "first
class object as data" that way (but that need not be the "official"
interpretation).

Thanks for this info. The interpreter of Axiom can invoke the compiler of
course. But the above meant calling the compiler from within a compiled function
at run time. Any comments from others?

That's in fact a very good development. After all, one always wants to built
upon prior art. Just even reading the first few paragraphs of the thesis already
points out some needed modification to the proposed design: I have assumed that
mostly unit conversions are proportional (I used two fields that are "factors")
so that linear conversion like centigrade to fahrenheit is not immediately
handled without a translation first. And, of course, there are non-linearly
scaled units like decibels, or the Richter scale of earthquakes or the
categories of hurricanes.

You are welcome, but please just call me "William". I wish to also thank you
since I have learnt quite a bit myself.

This is what research is all about and in my opinion, you are very qualified for
this project and your expertise will continue to grow.

Despite having taught unit conversion to some liberal arts students (you can't
expect too much from a text like those) I am also just beginning to learn how to
teach units conversion and to apply that concept to teaching percentage
problems---requiring pecentages carry their reference values as units. So my
point is, one only becomes competent AFTERwards. It's so much easier (to me) to
understand and do the exercises in percentages, where the reference values keep
changing, which now all becomes unit-conversion problems! If I remember, I'll
tell you how this new method fairs after the semester is over.

Please, we are all "Friends of Axiom" (a defunct club that I think participants
from this discussion forum really belong. I would rather not call myself a
developer, since I have not written algebra code for quite a while and have
fallen behind). In this forum, we do not wear our hard hats. So everyone is
welcome as long as they are interested in Axiom (including critizing Axiom).

Your background seems to have quite a bit in common with other active
developers.

Since you have a graduate degree and two undergraduate ones, you are an
academic. Like it or not :-). In the academic world, a lot of research is done
without funding.

Great.

Perhaps this is already addressed somewhere, but is there a convention
about BibTeX files and Axiom pamphlet files?  I see in the archives
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-05/msg00041.html
that Tim has some kind of axiom.bib.pamphlet file - did this ever get
posted?  If not, I would appreciate it being added :-).  I also suggest
this might be a good time to set up some kind of system for this sort
of thing - if we want to do one universal bib file (good for avoiding
duplicates) we might want to establish some organization - for example,
I doubt any other part of Axiom would need to reference a discussion on
the meaning of the word "dimension," but it is a relevant reference to
the units/dimensions pamphlet.  If the bib file gets too big it will be
hard to find what one wants without some good tools/conventions - is
there some good solution for managing this type of thing?

Cheers,
CY

I am not so sure whether I would really need that kind of reflection. In 
some cases it would be useful, for example, for the implementation of 
something like JUnit for Aldor. However, I somehow do not think that 
being able to query the structure of a type is a good idea. You gave a 
good reason, but isn't there a better way to achieve efficiency?

Exactly. Well, returning the list of function names would certainly be 
do-able, but the next thing a programmer would ask for is: How can I 
call the function with name "foo"? What is the input type? ...

Same in "aldor -gloop". By saying then

#include "aldor"
#include "aldorinterp"
Integer

one gets

%1 >> #include "aldor"
                                            Comp: 110 msec, Interp: 0 msec
%2 >> #include "aldorinterp"
                                            Comp: 30 msec, Interp: 0 msec
%3 >> Integer
   () @ Join(
PrimitiveType with
         coerce: BInt -> %
         coerce: % -> BInt
     ==  add ()
,
IntegerType with export to IntegerSegment(%)
     ==  add ()
)
                                            Comp: 10 msec, Interp: 0 msec

But again, that is the interpreter. I cannot do anything useful with 
that output in a stand-alone program.

I think I am happy that the Aldor code itself is not modifyable (as in 
Maple).

If memory serves me Aldor made Types be first-class objects.
You could create, assign, and pass Type objects to functions.

There is an Axiom bibliograph here:

that can be searched and downloaded in bibtex format.

i wouldn't expect anyone to find this in the source tree as i've
never documented the process for creating pamphlets in axiom (although
i will, at least according to my intention).

actually src/doc/axiom.bib.pamphlet is intended to have all of the
bibtex references so the pamphlet files only have to look at one
place for references. except for an example case i have not yet
spread the automation for bibtex references. there is a bibliography
section in every pamphlet file.

Hehe - oops.  Note to self - do find on source tree before asking next
time.

OK, looking at this, I see it is intended to enable linking to the
pamphlet files themselves.  For external references, to books/journal
articles/what have you/, should the pamphlet file maintain its own bib
file?

Cheers,
CY

Yes, but another reason, in the above example of field, is in allowing
generalizations to work, not just efficiency due to data representation
(reducing computation in the field to that in the underlying integral domain, as
in Grobner bases computation). For example, if I have a constructor that
requires an integral domain R as a parameter, and I constructed in the package
the quotient field of R, as you may suggest as an explicit way to achieve
efficiency, then the package will FAIL if R is actually a field (you can
consider this as a bug if you like), even though a field IS an integral domain,
mathematically. If we COULD ask whether R is a quotient field (not just a field)
and if in case of affirmative answer also find out the underlying integral
domain S of R = FRAC S, we would be able to replace R by S for the package. Of
course, you may say a user should then use S in the first place. But we should
not expect that, which limits the power of the system, and we are aiming for
automation: the requested integral domain R could be just something returned
during the course of a computation. So without such a feature, I doubt types and
domains can be considered as "first class" objects.

Yes, this would be recursive, and certainly relates to the Crystal vision of
Tim.

The "way" to do that would be to pass "true" or "false" as parameters to the
package Dom to avoid run-time code-modification. However, this is not "totally"
dynamic (modification is anticipated at compile time):

Dom(b:Boolean): with           {
   foo: % -> Boolean;              } 
  == add                       {
   foo(x: %): Boolean == b;        }

This is a balance (trade-off?) between power and responsibility. Don't most
programmers want power and not responsibilities? :-)  Much code-modification (at
least for higher level languages) is obsoleted (that is probably a good thing)
due to parametric polymorphism, but I am not ruling out applications (other than
hacking) that require that type of programming power. Note that
code-modification is "totally" dynamic since the modification is not
anticipated. It is not reasonable to expect programmers to anticipate all
possible modifications of code, and thus, parametric polymorphism is not
sufficient, or equivalent, and not as powerful.

Nice!  I don't suppose we could make that a front end to the
src/doc/axiom.bib.pamphlet file when it becomes universal?

Cheers,

P.S. - any opinions about shifting www.axiom-developer.org to point to
the Plone work by default?  Or is it a concern that that would result
in less activity on the wiki?

Right, but isn't the bibliography section in the pamphlet file
incompatible with bibtex?  Certainly the formatting is different. 
Doesn't a .bib file need to be separate?

If we want axoim.bib.pamphlet to be universal that will take some
management - we might wind up referencing a large subset of all
mathematical and scientific papers someday! :-)  (Well, one can hope
anyway...)

CY

As usual, should have done a bit more testing; use the attached
domain2.as - it makes map work a bit better.

a := map(theIntegerType(), theIntegerType())
lookup(theIntegerType(), "-", a);

works, but axiom will not display the object returned by lookup - it's
expecting an SExpression (ie a list of lispy values), and we're feeding
it a more complex structure.

Ho hum,

Peter.

Just in case you haven't come across it, the language Frink has
focused on units and conversions between units:

     <http://futureboy.homeip.net/frinkdocs/>

The documentation is quite humourous and worth a read.

The language was presented at the Lightweight Languages 4
conference at MIT and a video from that presentation is available
along with the slides at:

Yep; they can be passed around as normal.

As people have discovered, you wind up confusing the interpreter when
used directly.  

You can still do some useful things with them by disguising the fact
that they are domains, so in aldor have a type

AldorDomain: with {
 	make: (T: BasicType) -> %
} == add {
	Rep ==> T;

	make(T: BasicType): % == per T;
}

and your aldor programs can return this to axiom.

Then make sure the interpreter can only see it.

Of course, it isn't really that useful as it is - there are no
operations on domains that are documented in aldor, so for example you
can't say 
	"if T = Integer then ..."
or
	"findOperation(T, add, (T, T) -> T)"

The second is handy if you want to write a specialised interpreter, by
the way.  In any case, you can write a domain like domain.as (see
below).  All it does is makes sure that axiom sees an object, while
aldor has a type to play with.  It can be extended to "know" about any
number of domains.

Even with these limitations, types and constructors as first class
objects are pretty powerful.  You can build domains on the fly,
construct functions, etc. To go further, you need a bit of reflection
(cf the java lang.reflect stuff for where this is going). People not
interested in axiom internals should switch off here.

Of course, the axiom interpreter must be able to do the "findOperation"
thing, and here we need to know how axiom (and aldor) represent domains.
This is where the less brave stop reading, and I should stop writing.

>From memory, and looking at interop.boot, we find that a domain is a
cons pair of two elements.  The first is a vector of functions (eg.
$oldAxiomDomainDispatch), and the second is used as an argument to
functions within the vector. 

The functions do the following:
1)	return the name of the domain, as a null terminated string
2)	unknown
3)	lookup an export by hashcode
4)	return the domain's hashcode
5) 	unknown (inheritance related).


Categories are similar, but have a different vector of functions.

Next step is to abuse this information and extend our aldor domain above
to include these operations.  Here aldor's "pretend" keyword and a
strong stomach are useful.

You wind up with something like domain2.as, below.

I've tested this as far as:
	lookup(theIntegerType(), "1", theIntegerType())
which extracts 1 from the Integer domain.

NB: This is very crash prone, and don't try to print the name of a
mapping - it won't work - not sure why.

There are other things that could be held in a domain object - eg a list
of exports, or a list of categories.  Adding this would be a bit of a
project though.

Anyway, hope this is interesting...

Peter.

Alan,

Frink has developed software to work on units. One of the expressed
desires on the Frink webpage is to develop a version of the package
that would work on symbolic values.

On the Axiom mailing list we have been discussing this particular topic.
Axiom is a free, general purpose computer algebra system similar in
scope and power to Mathematica and Maple. It does not currently support
Units or Dimensions on input values but this is being discussed.
(see http://page.axiom-developer.org)

I've been looking at the Frink software and read the units.txt file
(a rather amusing document) in detail. It is clear we have much to
learn from your efforts. 

I see that the software is "free" but I couldn't find the source
anywhere. I was hoping to learn what you've already done so I could
have a better reference point than my own, uneducated opinion. Is
the source available for study?

Tim Daly

Hey Tim, is the CATS arch archive for Axiom available somewhere?  It
doesn't seem to be listed on the server.

Cheers,

CATS isn't uploaded at the moment.
I have the branch on my home machine.
If you'd like I can create the arch branch.

No biggie - I was looking for interesting things to download and
examine during my "offline" period, and CATS sounds interesting.  But
since I might be offline tomorrow don't worry on my account.

No I do not think that "code-modification" is the meaning
of "constructed and manipulated" in reference to Aldor.
What you are describing is equivalent for example to allowing
modifiable string *constants* -- something that used to be
possible in the C programming language, i.e. pass a pointer
to a string constant say "xxx" to a function that modifies
it's value to, say "123". Later in your program when you
have written what looks like "xxx" is now treated as "123".
I am also old enough to remember when it was possible for
a bug in Fortran to inadvertently modify the value of a
integer constant because these were passed by reference
to a location in memory that was initialized to the proper
value.

I agree that this practice is essentially "banned" - for
good reason!

But I think that is exactly what is implied by construct
and manipulate in this context. Functions in lisp are
just lists of a certain kind and so yes of course they
can be manipulated as lists. Functions in Aldor (and most
other languages) are more complex things than lists but
still then can be constructed and manipulated like any
other *first class objects*. For example we can curry
them, we can compose them etc., to make new functions,
in the same way that we can create the integer 2 and we
can add 2 + 2 and get a new integer.

I supposed however that what you might be asking is whether
functions in Aldor are "mutable" in the same way that
lists are mutable in lisp (or arrays are mutable in other
languages). I think the answer is "no". In general constants
are not mutable in this way and functions are constants.
But Aldor does allow use to use names which are assigned
values which are functions and of course the values assigned
to such names can change during the course of a computation.

I am quite sure that by design this is not "available" in
Aldor and that it is not implied by the description of Aldor
quoted at the beginning of this messages.

In an interesting paper recently pointed out to me by Ralf
Hemmecke:

http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/~bj/paraldor/WWW/docs/discussion/define.pdf

A D Kennedy defines first class entities as follows:

"An object is first class if its value can be expressed as
an anonymous constant expression."

And gives the following examples:

  1@SingleInteger -- is an anonymous integer constant,

  (x: SingleInteger): SingleInteger +-> x * x
    -- is an anonymous function constant
    -- (a.k.a. a lambda expression)

  with {+: (%,%) -> %; inv: % -> %}
    -- is an anonymous category constant

  add {
    Rep == SingleInteger;
    import from Rep;
    (x: %) + (y: %): % == per((rep x) + (rep y));
    inv(x: %): % == per(1 / rep x)
  } -- is an anonymous domain constant

--------

So the fact that "types and functions are first class entities"
in Aldor specifically allows them to be constructed and
manipulated like anything else whose value is a constant.
This does not mean that we can change the *value* (i.e. the
meaning) of a function that adds 1 to its argument (referred
to as "inc" in your example above) so that later adds 2
instead of adding 1, any more than we can change 1 to mean 2.
But we can of course change what the name "inc" refers to so
that it might later refer to a function that adds 2. And
we can pass functions as arguments to other functions which
might apply them or use them to construct new functions which
are then returned as the value of the function etc.

However Aldor is still statically typed in the sense that
we cannot change an object which has been declared as being
of one type into another. But Aldor/Axiom types are quite
powerful since then can be constructed from union, record
and mapping, so we can write things like:

(1) ->   x:Union(Integer,Float,Integer->Integer)
                                        Type: Void
(2) ->   x:=1

   (2)  1
                            Type: Union(Integer,...)
(3) ->   x+x

   (3)  2
                               Type: PositiveInteger
(4) ->   x:=1.0

   (4)  1.0
                               Type: Union(Float,...)
(5) ->   sin(x)

   (5)  0.8414709848 0789650665
                                          Type: Float
(6) ->   x:=(w +-> w+1)

   (6)  theMap(Closure)
                 Type: Union((Integer -> Integer),...)
(7) ->   (x::(Integer->Integer))(1)

   (7)  2
                                 Type: PositiveInteger
(8) ->

and x would still be considered a statically typed first
class object.

[snipped]

In light of your view (which is the correct view) that functions are constants,
I might have used the term "code-modification" wrongly. I was using it in the
sense that function code is data and data is being modified, so code is modified
in the process, but not in the sense of changing the function, which perhaps
should remain unaltered. So let me instead ask whether a copy of the data
representing the definition of the function may be modified to create another
function.
Constants should still be available to create new objects. So let me modify my
example. Suppose "inc" is a compiled function that increments 1 to its argument.
Then I can assign it to a variable:

variableFunction := inc

if you like,

variableFunction := copy(inc)

so I will not modify "inc" in any way. However, I want the definition for "inc"
to be available to me (perhaps as a lambda expression, perhaps its Axiom
equivalent) and that I can change this definition in my copy of "inc" (that is,
operating ON the function object) to create a new function that increments 2 to
its argument. This would be analogous to say how one modifies the entries of a
matrix via a copy. (Actually, we are allowed to directly change the entry of a
matrix for efficiency if the matrix has Mutable). But for this discussion, I am
no longer assuming functions are mutable (I probably was).

These are operations USING the function, not operations ON the functions. If
"constructed and manipulated" means only USING the functions, I don't see any
extra power in Aldor that is not already in Axiom.

I will assume functions are not mutable, but I don't see a compelling reason to
enforce this if functions are indeed "first class" (here, meaning on equal
footing as data objects). If matrices and other structures can be mutable, why
should functions be different? (OK, in the hands of careless programmers, this
power will play havoc; but so would such programmers do damage to matrix
computations or other mutable objects).

You mean I can do:

variableFunction:= inc1
variableFunction(5)

               6
 
variableFunction:= inc2
variableFunction(5)

               7
I don't see that as a powerful feature. In fact, its power is much like a TeX
macro. Convenient, yes.

The statement needs clarification. But shouldn't the definition of function (the
code, not just the signature) be available for manipulation even if the function
itself is kept constant?

OK, grant you that. There is still a difference in "types and functions as first
class entities" and usual domain objects as first class entities. For domains,
we are normally not exposed to the Rep, but if we like, we CAN provide that
functionality by means of functions exported for that domain. An example would
be PRODUCT or FRAC (where using "numerator" and "denominator" we can extra
fields in the Rep, modify them, and create a new fraction). For the "domain of
functions", the Rep of a function may be its anonymous function constant (lambda
expression), but it seems we are not allowed to provide functionality to read
this lambda expression and construct new objects from it. If indeed objects in
the "domain of functions" are first class objects, we should be able to query
its properties. The same thing for the "domain of Type" (probably an
ill-constructed term), we should be able to query the properties of domains and
categories.

All that amounts to is just pointers or macros. As long as it is only USING the
functions rather than operating ON the functions, such features do not give
functions equal status as objects in domains (even if by definition, they are
both first class; perhaps they should be called weak first class).

Sure, because the type of x is actually Union(Integer, ...) throughout all these
computations. It is only because the interpreter understands Union to apply
automatically the  "case" function and locate the other function calls. I am not
following the relevance to "first class object".

Thanks again for your input.

Hmm, but one can also achieve what you want by adding a function to the 
Fraction constructor

Fraction(R: IntegralDomain): with {
   ...
   fractionField: Boolean;
   underlyingDomain: IntegralDomain;
   ...
} == add {
   fractionField: Boolean == true;
   underlyingDomain: IntegralDomain == R;
   ...
}

If one then gets a field K, one just has to ask

if K has with {fractionField: Boolean} then {
    Groebner(underlyingDomain K, coercedPolys);
} else {
   Groebner(K, polys);
}

Changes http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/207CertainLimitFailure/diff
--
Consider the following two expressions:

\begin{axiom}
exa:=integrate(log(1/x)/x^a,x)
exb:=integrate(log(1/x)*x^b,x)
\end{axiom}
which are equivalent by setting $a=-b$.
However, the operation 'limit' doesn't like both equally well:
\begin{axiom}
limit(exa,x=0)
limit(exb,x=0)
\end{axiom}

Why would it fail? I don't think it does, in fact. However, if you are going to
apply FRAC you can simply ask whether the domain is a Field.

On the other hand, given a Field to ask whether it is a QuotientField is a
question that I consider quite important. 

However, the desirable query

  if R has QuotientField S

thus defining S is, I think, quite difficult to implement sensibly. Throughout
Axiom, this effect is obtained by adding another parameter to the
Package/Domain signature like:

MyPackage(F: Field, S: IntegralDomain): ...

  if F is Fraction S then

I think in axiom the keyword 'is' works only where we define function
(and not in function declaration) in other words:

MyPackage(F: Field, S: IntegralDomain): ...
  myfunc(%):Type -> Type

  add
     if F is Fraction S then
        myfunc...
     else
        myfunc...

Cheers,

Greg

I think that works only in function definition but not in function
decalaration.

Martin, do you really mean "is" instead of "has"? I don't think that 
your "if" expression works with Aldor.

Anyway, if I were a compiler/interpreter, what would I do with something 
like

if F is Fraction S then ...

I would first evaluate the function "Fraction" obtaining a type T and 
then check whether F and T are the same thing. S would be lost. One 
could only achieve your wish by pattern matching, but Axiom doesn't work 
that way, does it?

Greg, what do you mean by that?

This is the axiom-developer server where we run MathAction. It
is a x686 shared virtual server running RedHat 9.  The error
occurs when trying to build Axiom patch-44 which includes
gcl-2.6.7. The build succeeds if I use the normal Axiom default
of --enable-maxpage=3D128*1024, but then I get the
ALLOCATE-CONTINUOUS-PAGES error. See below. That is why I was
trying to increase maxpage.

Ok. Here is where CSTACK_ADDRESS is mentioned in the configure
output:

...
checking for randomized sbrk... no
checking finding DBEGIN... got 0x8000000
checking finding CSTACK_ADDRESS... got 1073738356
...

In config.log I see

...
configure:3780: checking for sbrk
configure:3798: gcc -o conftest      conftest.c  1>&5
configure:3814: checking for randomized sbrk
configure:3831: gcc -o conftest      conftest.c  1>&5
configure:3863: gcc -o conftest      conftest.c  1>&5
configure:3984: checking finding DBEGIN

configure:4051: checking finding CSTACK_ADDRESS
configure:4068: gcc -o conftest      conftest.c  1>&5
...

So I don't see a problem here. Do you?

I do not know what you mean by "allocate page types explicitly".
Is this a function like si::allocate-contiguous-pages that I used
in the Axiom )lisp command below? Or does this have something to
do with the gcl configuration?

As I mentioned in the previous email, all seems well if I call

  )lisp (si::allocate-contiguous-pages 3000 t)

inside Axiom before access the Aldor category. Why do you say
that I am "totally out of memory"?

> You need to configure with a greater --enable-maxpage.

That is what I tried to do but the build of gcl fails as
I mentioned above.

Aldor used to be available as an optional library compiler
for the commercial version of Axiom. The current open source
version of Axiom was released without Aldor because NAG had
previously and separately given the rights to the Aldor source
to "aldor.org" (aka. Stephen Watt). "aldor.org" makes binary
versions of Aldor available for free for non-commmercial use
but does not follow the current open source licensing model.

Recently Peter Broadbery was able to configure the open source
version of Axiom to use the Aldor binary on linux. So now
Axiom functions the way it used to in the commercial release
but the license status of Aldor is still uncertain. I have made
several requests to Stephen Watt to obtain a copy of the
source code license for Aldor but I have not yet heard from
him.

I presuemt that to distribute on Debian we would require
a GPL-compatible source license to Aldor, right?

Wonderful. I think we should try hard to make this happen.
I would love to be able to just 'apt-get install aldor'! :)

Bill Page.

Stephen,

One of our developers (Camm Maquire) is also a Debian maintainer.
In the past he has packaged Axiom so that it is possible (in a debian
compatible distribution) to type 'apt get axiom' and have it installed
on your machine (across about 10 architectures). He'd like to do the
same for Aldor. The mail snippet is attached below. 

This would greatly increase the distribution base for Aldor and attract
more developers and users to both Aldor and Axiom.

IIRC some years ago I saw a comment to the effect that the intent was
to develop Aldor commercially and thus an open source scenario wasn't
desirable, but I can no longer locate the reference and it may or may
not still be true.  I note in
http://www.aldor.org/license-rationale.html what seems to be the main
problem is the requirement that Aldor needs to be able to make
modifications available, e.g. "Parts of the existing code base in the
software package that this license is applied to require Aldor.org to
make any updates available to the initial contributors."  Is this
NAG/IBM?  If so, could this be dealt with the same way that issue was
handled with Axiom itself?

Alternately, if Steve Watt or whoever should be reached can't be
reached to discuss the issue, was NAG's release of Aldor to the
Aldor.org group exclusive?  Perhaps NAG could release the original
Aldor to Axiom also, just with a different name?

I think it has to meet the Debian Free Software Guidlines to be
included in the "main" distribution, otherwise I think it could go in
non-free?

I must admit for myself I'm not at all motivated to look at Aldor
unless it can be a default part of the free Axiom.  Aldor might be
nicer than SPAD, but I just can't see putting time and work into a
non-open source scenario personally.

Cheers,
CY

(Note - I replied to both dev and legal lists, but for this part I
think axiom-legal is the appropriate place - no point clogging up the
developer list with license discussions when we have a special place to
talk about such issues. :-)

Mathematically speaking, it should not, but one is still creating only an
isomorphic copy (presumably with a less efficient data structure) since the
total quotient ring of a field is isomorphic to the field itself. However, while
FRAC FRAC INT in the interpreter seems to return a valid domain, a: FRAC FRAC
INT would return an error that the type is invalid. The problem is the current
algebra code for FRAC does not anticipate a field as its argument because it was
implemented as the localization of the ring with respect to a multipicatively
closed set.

Not only that, such a use is limited because it requires the user to supply S
already.

This construction certainly is because Axiom does not support querying the
parameters of a constructor from a domain resulting from that constructor. So if
some function returns a domain (constructors are such functions), the domain
already hides its parameters unless the author deliberately provides functions
to return such information (as suggested by Ralf).

Besides requiring a priori knowledge of S, the above "work around" does not help
with the constructor FRAC when its parameter is a field (not to mention when it
is FRAC S for some S). Ideally, FRAC F when F is a field should simply return F,
but then since F need not be of the form FRAC R for an integral domain R (for
example when F is a finite field), it would be meaningless to export functions
like numerator or denominator. But this necessitates recursive inquiry if R may
itself be a field. To avoid all such problems, Axiom (probably just the
interpreter) forbids FRAC FRAC INT.  If it is possible to inquire about the
parameters or even the constructor of F (by this I mean, is F has the form  FRAC
S, or FF(p, n), etc without having the user to specify any S, p, or n), and to
return info on the parameters, then types and domains can be truly analogous to
normal data objects: we are able to look into the entries of a matrix, or the
terms and coefficients of a polynomial: what I called operations ON the objects,
not USING the objects. Only by having operations ON the objects can one add
operations USING the objects. This feature would facilitate simplification of
type construction such as FRAC FRAC INT to just FRAC INT, making them valid as
well as efficiently and trivially implementable.

I meant the above in the sense of pattern matching -- whereas the following
sentence was meant to indicate that this is is not the way to go.

Yes, maybe you remember that I was asking for exactly this a while ago.

In fraction.spac the Fraction code starts with
Fraction(S: IntegralDomain): QuotientFieldCategory S with
   if S has IntegerNumberSystem and S has OpenMath then OpenMath
   if S has canonical and S has GcdDomain and S has canonicalUnitNormal
       then canonical

   ...

Isn't it allowed to modify this to

       then F
       else LocalAlgebra(S, S, S) add ...

It seems that the interpreter knows more about algebra as I would like. 
If one does not like FRAC FRAC INT then is should clearly be specified 
somewhere and not hidden in the interpreter. IMHO, the interpreter 
should interpret, but not add "implicit knowledge" that is not in the 
SPAD code itself.

Yes, we are able to look inside a matrix and even to modify entries 
destructively, but this only works because the designer of the Matrix 
has given enough exports to do so. Otherwise Matrix would just be a 
black box which might have properties like, for example, Algebra(R). 
Good enough for some algorithms, but probably not what an ordinary 
person thinks about matrices.

That is why I think that an explicit export of a function that returns 
the parameter domain would be the better way to go. If Q = FRAC R and 
one wants to get out R from Q, it is basically the same as asking to get
1 out of x (where x was previously obtained by x := inc(1). Or was it
x:=lenght("a") and one wants to get "a"?

The coersion to InputForm produces a lispy representation for
most types. E.g.
\begin{axiom}
p:POLY INT:=x^2+1
p::InputForm
interpret(p)
\end{axiom}

But this fails for functions
\begin{axiom}
f:INT->INT
f(x) == x^2+1
f::InputForm
\end{axiom}
So far so good, but
\begin{axiom}
interpret(f)
\end{axiom}

What exactly is the lisp needed here?

I suppose I thought Lisp is useful here because Union is a low level construct
and so lisp may be needed to convert a LIST STRING object as a delisted tuple of
STRING objects to Union, just like

 Union("Mass", "Length")

which works, instead of 
 
 Union(["Mass", "Length"])

which does not work as intended. I tried to do this within Axiom
interpreter/compiler and was not able to. Roughly, need a domain constructor:

Dimension(s: List String):SetCategory == Union(delisted s)

Thanks for your interest in this.

William

++added:

This domain (renamed from AldorDomain) written in Aldor by Peter
Broadbery::

  ... can still do some useful things with them by disguising the fact
  that they are domains, so in aldor have a type

  AldorDomain: with {
        make: (T: BasicType) -> %
  } == add {
        Rep ==> T;

        make(T: BasicType): % == per T;
  }

  and your aldor programs can return this to axiom.

  Then make sure the interpreter can only see it.

  Of course, it isn't really that useful as it is - there are no
  operations on domains that are documented in aldor, so for example you
  can't say 
        "if T = Integer then ..."
  or
        "findOperation(T, add, (T, T) -> T)"

  The second is handy if you want to write a specialised interpreter, by
  the way.  In any case, you can write a domain like domain.as (see
  below).  All it does is makes sure that axiom sees an object, while
  aldor has a type to play with.  It can be extended to "know" about any
  number of domains.

  Even with these limitations, types and constructors as first class
  objects are pretty powerful.  You can build domains on the fly,
  construct functions, etc. To go further, you need a bit of reflection
  (cf the java lang.reflect stuff for where this is going). People not
  interested in axiom internals should switch off here.

		hashCode(a) = hashCode(b)
	}


	coerce(t: %): OutputForm == {
		import from String;
		"<SomeType>"::OutputForm
	}

	name(t: %): SExpression == {
		dom := t pretend Rep2;
		axiomName((dom.v.domName)(dom.o))
	}

	-- nb: cf. interop.boot, basicLookup
	lookup(t: %, name: String, type: %): SExpression == {
		-- lookup takes the following arguments:
		-- domain rep, domain, operation, conspair, flag, lookupFn
		import from List SExpression;
		dom := t pretend Rep2;
		box: SExpression := convert [convert ""];
		lookupFn :=  dom.v.lookup;
		nil := convert [];
		lookupFn(dom.o, 
			 dom pretend SExpression, 
			 hashString(convert name), 
			 convert hashCode(type),
			 box,
			 nil, lookupFn pretend SExpression);
	}

	hashCode(t: %): Integer == {
		dom := t pretend Rep2;
		integer((dom.v.hashCode)(dom.o))
	}

	local axiomName(s: SExpression): SExpression == {
		BOOT_:_:DNameToSExpr(s);
	}

	local hashString(s: SExpression): SExpression == {
		BOOT_:_:hashString(s);
	}
}
\end{aldor}

And it nearly solves the problem!
\begin{axiom}
(Integer,Float)
\end{axiom}

This toy example

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMapping

"... provides a function-like type that can be queried for
domain and co-domain."

Of course this is not same as being about to manipulate
the code part of a function. On the other hand in the
Axiom interpreter (which operates closer to lisp then to
Aldor) this is also nearly possible.

Try:

\begin{axiom}
f:Float->INT
f(x) =3D=3D floor(x)
f(1.1)
f::InputForm
\end{axiom}

Unfortunately Axiom's 'interpret' function is not able to
interpret the InputForm generated for such functions. :( See
issue report:

 #208 interpret(x::InputFor)=3Dx is broken for functions and types

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/208InterpretXInputForXIsBrokenForFunctio
nsAndTypes

However, my opinion is better to rely on higher-order functions,
e.i. functions that manipulate and return functions in the
manner provided by Aldor and Spad rather than handling the
interpreter's functions in this lispy manner.

Formal results from the theory of programming languages and
category theory show that a language like Aldor that includes
sufficient structure to represent cartesian closed objects and
operations based on typed lambda calculus are equally powerful
to such lower level manipulations.

Bill Page.

??changed:
-Axiom has both an "interpreter":AxiomInterpreter and a built-in
-"compiler":ProgrammingAxiom.
Axiom has both an interactive language or
"interpreter":AxiomInterpreter for user interactions and
a programming language "compiler":ProgrammingAxiom
for building library modules.

++added:

  Like Modula 2, PASCAL, FORTRAN, and Ada, the programming
language emphasizes strict type-checking. Unlike these
languages, types in Axiom are dynamic objects: they are
created at run-time in response to user commands.

  The Axiom interactive language is oriented towards
ease-of-use. The Axiom interpreter uses type-inferencing
to deduce the type of an object from user input. Type
declarations can generally be omitted for common types
in the interactive language.

  The Axiom compiler language (version 1 of the language
is called SPAD, version 2 of the language is called [Aldor])
on the other hand is based on strong static types that must
be explicitly specified by the programmer.

Type Inference in the Interpreter

??changed:
-Axiom is very strict with types (meaning: where the operation
-takes place). The division of 1+2 by 3 takes place in
-Fraction Integer (field of rational numbers) and that is
-where the answer should be, even if it is 1. Most people
-would automatically "retract" this to the integer 1. But in
-general, there is no natural way to do so (why not retract
-1 to a natural number, for example?).  So Axiom provides the
-user a way to "coerce" an answer to another type. You can coerce
-1 to any of many, many types, for example, as a polynomial,
-or even as a matrix (or the unit element of any ring).
Axiom is very strict with types (meaning: that it must be
completely unambiguous where each operation takes place).

++added:
Types of Objects, Domains, and Categories

  In Axiom the concept of "Type" is universally applied at
all levels.

  From the Axiom Book: Appendix B Glossary

  - The type of any category is the unique symbol Category.

  - The type of a domain is any category to which the domain
    belongs.

  - The type of any other object is either the (unique) domain
    to which the object belongs or a subdomain of that domain.

  - The type of objects is in general not unique.

  From the Axiom Book: Technical Introduction

    Every Axiom object is an instance of some domain. That
domain is also called the type of the object. Thus the
typeOf -1 is inferred by the interpret to be Integer and
the typeOf the variable x:Integer is declared to be Integer.
Similarly the typeOf "daniel" is String. The type of an
object, however, is not unique. The type of integer 7 is
not only Integer but also NonNegativeInteger, PositiveInteger,
and possibly, in general, any other *subdomain* of the
domain Integer.

Domains are defined by Axiom by programs of the form::

  Name(Parameters): JoinCategorys
    with Exports == Extends
      add Rep == RepDomain
        Implementation 

The Name of each domain is used to refer to the collection
of its instances. For example, Integer denotes "the integers",
Float denotes "the floating point numbers" etc. For example::

  Fraction(S: IntegralDomain): QuotientFieldCategory S with
       if S has canonical and S has GcdDomain
         and S has canonicalUnitNormal
           then canonical
    == LocalAlgebra(S, S, S) add
      Rep:= Record(num:S, den:S)
      coerce(d:S):% == [d,1]
      zero?(x:%) == zero? x.num

Thus the type of Fraction Integer is 'QuotientFieldCategory
Integer with canonical'. The axiom 'canonical' means that
equal elements of the domain are in fact identical.

We also say that the domain Fraction(s) *extends* the domain
LocalAlgebera(S,S,S). Domains can extend each other in a
circular mutually recursive manner so in general the extends
relationship fors a directed graph with cycles.

Fractions are represented as the domain Record(num:S, den:S).

In Axiom domains and subdomains are themselves objects that
have types. The type of a domain or subdomain is called a
category. Categories are described by programs of the form::

   Name(...): Category == JoinCategorys
     with Exports
      add Imports
        Implementation 

The type of every category is the distinguished symbol
Category. The category Name is used to denote the collection
of domains of that type. For example, category Ring denotes
the class of all rings.

For example::

  QuotientFieldCategory(S: IntegralDomain): Category ==
    Join(Field, Algebra S, RetractableTo S, FullyEvalableOver S,
         DifferentialExtension S, FullyLinearlyExplicitRingOver S,
           Patternable S, FullyPatternMatchable S) with
      _/     : (S, S) -> %
         ++ d1 / d2 returns the fraction d1 divided by d2.
      numer  : % -> S
         ++ numer(x) returns the numerator of the fraction x.
      denom  : % -> S
      ...
      if S has PolynomialFactorizationExplicit then
        PolynomialFactorizationExplicit
   add
      import MatrixCommonDenominator(S, %)
      numerator(x) == numer(x)::%
      denominator(x) == denom(x) ::%
      ...

Categories say nothing about representation. Domains, which
are instances of category types, specify representations.

Categories form hierarchies (technically, directed-acyclic
graphs). A simplified hierarchical world of algebraic
categories is shown below. At the top of this world is
SetCategory, the class of algebraic sets. The notions of
parents, ancestors, and descendants is clear. Thus ordered
sets (domains of category OrderedSet) and rings are also
algebraic sets. Likewise, fields and integral domains are
rings and algebraic sets. However fields and integral
domains are not ordered sets::

  SetCategory +---- Ring ---- IntegralDomain ---- Field
              |
              +----  Finite    ---+
              |                    \
              +---- OrderedSet -----+ OrderedFinite

In light of the above definitions of 'Type' in Axiom, it
would seem that the type of
\begin{axiom}
I:=Integer
\end{axiom}

which Axiom prints as 'Domain' is actually a 'Category'.
That certainly is confusing terminology... I guess we just
have to remember that whenever we see 'Type: Domain' what
Axiom really means is 'Type: SomeCategory(...)'.

Issue report #209 however shows that *perhaps* it would be
useful to **flatten** Axiom's two-level object model of
categories and domains by embedding Categories into the
domain called Domain. This would allow convenient things
like evaluating the expression::

  (Integer,Float)

as type Tuple(Domain).

As #209 reports, Axiom internally generates a call to the
function '|Domain|' and then fails with an undefined. That
seems peculiarly broken to me and I wonder if the last
commercial version of Axiom has this same behaviour or was
something lost in the porting to the open source gcl-based
version? I thorough search of the current Axiom sources did
not turn up any function, package or domain named 'Domain'.

Peter,

I am quite interested in your ideas about providing
something equivalent to java.lang.reflect in Aldor and
Axoim. I think this might also be useful to solve the
problem with an undefined function |domain| which appears
when writing for example:

(1) ->  (Integer,Float)

in the Axiom interpreter. If I rename your AldorDomain to
just Domain then the patches below the Tuple of Domains
prints properly, although there are still other problems,
e.g. selection from the Tuple causes a seg fault.

I wonder if the the Rep =3D=3D Type really makes sense?

The stuff in interop.boot seems very obscure to me but
I am gradually absorbing a little.

Here's a simple patch that actually prints domain names by
calling devaluate() instead of manipulating the domain as
a record structure. There must also be something subtley
wrong with Rep2?

Patch follows:

I've just compiled Axiom 3.9 (and texmacs 1.0.5.9) on a RH EL system. Both installed to non standard locations.
While command line axiom works, and texmacs presents an axiom session (and actually launches axiom), I did not manage to get axiom working from within texmacs (I get no line promt ->, and when I press the ENTER key nothing happens, no evaluation, nothing). 

Forgive my stupidity but ... any help??

   I'll post my initial response to both of the lists you referenced in
the original mail, as Frink users might be interested in how units are
implemented in Frink.  Follow-ups should probably be directed to one
list or another, or to me personally.

   The source for Frink is currently not available, but I think it's
more useful to talk about the high-level design decisions rather than
particulars of implementation, which may change.

   As you know, there are lots of different ways that units and
dimensions could be implemented, and a lot of tradeoffs in performance,
memory usage, complexity, reversibility, and flexibility.  I've seen
implementation

   As noted in your mailing lists, I described the implementation
somewhat in my talk at the Lightweight Languages 4 conference at MIT.
The slides and video are available at:
http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/LL4.html

   Some design goals are:

   * Avoid hard-coding of any units of measure or dimensions.  The
number and base dimensions should be specified at run-time by a
configurable units file.

   * Try to make all operations constant-time.

   * Allow adding of base dimensions at runtime.  This is, in practice,
very rare and often ill-advised, (in fact, I've *never* had to do it,)
but may be a useful construct in some cases.

   * Allow for a variety of implementations.  In Java, this translates
to defining everything as an interface, and keeping each interface as
simple as possible.

   Some philosophies:

   * It makes absolutely no difference what your internal representation
 or base dimensions are.  That's just a display-time issue.  The user
should either 1.) ask for results in specific units (which provides an
important check that dimensions are what they expect) 2.) Set default
display units, see http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/#SettingDisplayUnits
3.) define their own unit file with the dimensions they like to use, or
4.) accept what comes out.

   * Don't try to solve the case of non-linear units within your system.
  Fahrenheit, Celsius, decibel, stellar magnitude, etc., are examples of
non-linear units with nonsensical zero points.  Frink implements these
as functions which require the user to understand the difference between
these units and ordinary linear units.  Doing anything else requires
reading minds, which is destined to fail.

   There are lots of ways that units could be implemented.  My
implementation can be described succinctly.  Every unit is a combination
of a magnitude (as a multiple of some base dimensions) and a list of
dimensions and their exponents.

   The decision to immediately reduce all values to multiples of some
base dimensions was chosen for performance and simplicity of coding.  It
has the disadvantage of going through a potential longer chain of
multiplications than if you kept the relations in a graph.  If these
multiplications are irreversible, like with most floating-point
implementations, this can cause problems or precision loss.  Frink tries
to avoid this by maintaining exact rational numbers when possible.
(e.g. an inch is defined as exactly 254/100 cm.)

   The standard data file uses SI base units as the base dimensions.
This is, of course, configurable at run-time:
   http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/LL4.html#slide17

The Unit interface:
   http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/LL4.html#slide20

The DimensionList interface:
http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/LL4.html#slide19

   The DimensionList interface tends to imply that you have an array of
integers which represent exponents.  This was done for simplicity and
performance, but it could be implemented alternately with a linked list
and a more complex enumerator and data structure returned, but this
would likely be slower.  This interface has one minor optimization in
it.  The getHighestIndex() method returns the highest index *used* for
that particular DimensionList, allowing quicker array operations,
especially if the most-used dimensions were defined first.  It also
allows you to add dimensions at runtime with no penalty.

   A class called DimensionManager keeps track of all of the base
dimensions (defined by a simplistic interface called Dimension) and
their names, base units, and index numbers.  As a concession to
efficiency, each fundamental dimension has an index associated with it.
 The first dimension added has a number of 0, and this increases by one
for each dimension added.  This number is guaranteed not to change over
the course of a run, but may change across runs.

   To allow implementations of some of these interfaces to be as minimal
as possible, without deriving from another class, math on Units and
DimensionLists are performed by other classes which use the methods
defined by these interfaces to perform all necessary operations.

   I know that this is a rather terse discussion, but hopefully it will
be helpful.  My primary recommendation is to not make your
implementation more complex than need be.  Implementing units really can
be quite simple.  Please let me know if you have more specific questions.

Agreed.  An Axiom implementation of units and dimensions would have to
be done in Axiom anyway, so I'm not terribly worried about source code.

IIRC the current thought on that is to define tables in Axiom for
unitsystems with the required conversion factors, but that has not yet
been thoroughly discussed, and there is some thinking to do when it
comes to handling things like the Natural (Planck) UnitSystem, which
doesn't really seem to HAVE basic dimensions.

You mean in execution time?

I have some thoughts about that, but it's down the road.

What do you mean by implementations?  Different unit and dimensional
systems?

Well, we want to define things in a way that makes interesting
operations simple, so to the extent internal representation impacts
that it can be important.

Not sure about this - how is reading minds required?  It's somewhat
fancier conversion logic, granted, but I'm not seeing how it's
fundamentally different except perhaps for the necessity of
establishing the illegality of temperatures below O deg K, -273 deg C,
etc.

Yes, that's essentially the approach I take in my attempt at a Maxima
units package.

How do you handle things like radians?  Work vs. Moment of Force, for
example?

Hehe - I'm in trouble.  My goal is to handle units and dimensions
"correctly." (I'm still learning what "correct" is.)  I agree that
unnecessary complexity is generally undesirable, but I have a feeling
Axiom is going to go a lot deeper into various issues than is "normal."

Thanks for the reference!

which denotes the collection of all domains.

Aldor is a computer programming language, like Scheme, Java or C#.

The site http://www.aldor.org provides information about the Aldor
programming language, its compiler and libraries, as well as downloads
for software and documentation.

>From a technical point of perspective, Aldor is a type-complete,
strongly-typed, imperative programming language with a two-level
object model of categories and domains (similar to the concept of
interfaces and classes in Java). Types and functions are first class
entities allowing them to be constructed and manipulated within
Aldor programs just like any other value. Pervasive use of dependent
types allows static checking of dynamic objects and provides
object-oriented features such as parametric polymorphism.  

What does this mean for a normal user? Aldor solves many difficulties
encountered with certain widely-used object-oriented programming
languages. It allows programs to use a natural style, combining the
more attractive and powerful properties of functional, object-oriented
and aspect-oriented styles.

Over View

The original motivation for Aldor was to provide an improved
extension language for the AXIOM computer algebra system: The
language had to be expressive enough to capture naturally the
high-level objects and relationships which arise in modern
mathematics. An implementation had to be efficient enough for
intense symbolic and numeric computing needs. And the language
had to be modular enough to allow large libraries of independently
developed facilities to be used together in any combination.

The formulation of the programming language has tried to balance
the mathematical desire for generality and uniformity, on one
hand, with the practical requirements of the most demanding
symbolic and numeric computation, on the other. For example,
types and functions are first class values, and dependent
types are fully supported, but the precise formulation of has
been carefully arranged to allow effective optimizaiton. Post
facto extensions allow libraries to be built in layers by
enriching existing objects, rather than introducing a
proliferation of variations. Both object-oriented and
functional programming styles are reconstructed naturally
form these basic semantic elements.

The Aldor compiler can be used to generate code which runs
within the Axiom system, separately, or linked into other
applications.

The compiler was available as part of the Axiom system from
1994 to 1999 and was then released as an independent language.

During its development at IBM Research, this programming
language was known internally as *A#* (A sharp) however that
name now refers to a version of Ada. The interim name "AXIOM-XL"
(Axiom Library Compiler) was used for a short period by NAG
before the legal trade name "Aldor" was established.

There are numerous places in the Axiom BOOT code that seems to
treat this name in a special manner as if it might be "built-in".
Eg. ::

  interp/bootfuns.lisp.pamphlet:(def-boot-val |$Domain| '(|Domain|)        
  interp/br-con.boot.pamphlet:    is [[h,:.],:t] and MEMBER(h,'(Domain SubDomain))
  interp/clammed.boot.pamphlet:  form in '((Mode) (Domain) (SubDomain (Domain))) = 
  interp/g-cndata.boot.pamphlet:      domain in '((Mode) (Domain) (SubDomain (Doma
  interp/i-analy.boot.pamphlet:  if ( oo = "%" ) or ( oo = "Domain" ) or ( domainF
  interp/i-coerce.boot.pamphlet:    t1 in '((Mode)  (Domain) (SubDomain (Domain))) =>
  interp/i-funsel.boot.pamphlet:  MEMBER('(SubDomain (Domain)),types1) => NIL
  interp/i-output.boot.pamphlet:  categoryForm? domain or domain in '((Mode) (Domain) (SubDomain (Domain))) =>
  interp/i-spec1.boot.pamphlet:  saeTypeSynonymValue := objNew(sae,'(Domain))
  interp/i-spec1.boot.pamphlet:  objMode triple = '(Domain) => triple
  interp/i-spec1.boot.pamphlet:      objMode(val) in '((Domain) (SubDomain (Domain))) =>
  interp/i-spec2.boot.pamphlet:    else if categoryForm?(type) then '(SubDomain (Domain))
  interp/i-spec2.boot.pamphlet:  type in '((Mode) (Domain)) => '(SubDomain (Domain))
  interp/parse.boot.pamphlet:        and m in '((Mode) (Domain) (SubDomain (Domain))) => D
  interp/setq.lisp.pamphlet:  CAPSULE |Union| |Record| |SubDomain| |Mapping| |Enumeration| |Domain| |Mode|))
  interp/setq.lisp.pamphlet:(SETQ |$Domain| '(|Domain|))
  interp/sys-pkg.lisp.pamphlet:    BOOT::YIELD BOOT::|Polynomial| BOOT::|$Domain| BOOT::STRINGPAD
  interp/trace.boot.pamphlet:      (objMode value in '((Mode) (Domain) (SubDomain (Domain)))) =>

However in searching for use and meaning of the domain 'Domain',
in all the Axiom algebra library I can find only one place that
explicity uses this domain.

In 'algebra/forttyp.spad.pamphlet' in the domain 'TheSymbolTable'
it reads::

    Entry : Domain  := Record(symtab:SymbolTable, _
                              returnType:FSTU, _
                              argList:List Symbol)

For details see [SandBox Domains And Types].

So apparently at least in 1992, such a domain might have existed
in Axiom.

Oddly (or perhaps as we might expect :) compiling this code in
the current version of Axiom produces some error messages::

   Semantic Errors: 
      ![1]  Domain is not a known type
      ![2]  void is not a known type

yet the compile does apparently successfully complete. But
does it work?

It was written mostly to show that you could do some operations on
domains - effectively allowing one to write more of an interpreter in
the extension language.  I'm not 100% confident of what the definitions
of "Domain", "SubDomain", "Category" and "Type" should be, so was
avoiding them.

If we can find a way that these can fit together and allow axiom to deal
with them coherently it would definitely be a good thing, but I'm not
sure I'm qualified to decide exactly what the semantics should be.

I think Rep ==> Type is more or less honest, given that a Type is an
object in the aldor world view. A  caveat is that it captures categories
(and "Type") as well as domains.

Yes - it is obscure.  Unfortunately it seemed to be the best solution at
the time, and then we hacked it about a little.  The trick is to try and
untangle it again.  There are (at least) two ways domains are treated -
one is as S-Expression, eg (|List| (|Integer|)) and the other is the
aldor "Rep2" object - in general axiom code handles both, while aldor
will only accept the latter.

Devaluate should be equivalent for all domains.  Ah, Mappings aren't
quite domains, since  'isDomain' fails for them.  Not sure what the
underlying bug is though.

It seems that that might have been the prevailing approach
in the latter stages of Axiom's development - a pity
considering Axiom's otherwise quite noble objectives
concerning mathematical rigor. ;) Seriously, this issue
does give me a headache that I would like to releave.

I agree that it would be a very good thing, but if you are
not sure you are qualified, then I am not sure that I am
even qualified to have an opinion! :)

Hmmm. Ok so when I am writing Aldor code in Axiom I (for
the most part) have this "aldor world view", right? So Type
is something native to Aldor?

In the Axiom interpret if I write:

  (1) -> Type

     (1)  Type
                                     Type: SubDomain Domain

It answers with a Type for Type that is hard for me to
understand ... especially considering that the Axiom Book
specifically says that the Type of Type is undefined. :(

Anyway, am I correct then to understand that

   Rep =3D=3D> Type

here means that we are going to 'pretend' about something
that is assumed to have a structure directly understood
by Aldor? Doesn't that mean that anything like:

          name(t: %): SExpression =3D=3D {
  -               dom :=3D t pretend Rep2;
  -               axiomName((dom.v.domName)(dom.o))
  +               dom :=3D t pretend SExpression;
  +               devaluate(dom);

that just pretends that something passed from Axiom has
such a structure would be rather dangerous? Instead we
would have to ask Axiom to do some kind of explicit
conversion to the Rep2 structure, right? Perhaps that
explains why the original code for name above (-) failed?

Notice how many question marks I wrote in the above
paragraph? :) That's how certain I am about all this
so please forgive me if my writing seems overly pedantic.

Given that in the AldorDomain code you write:

   theIntegerType(): % =3D=3D per Integer;

what is the difference in the interpreter when I write:

  (1) -> A:=3DInteger

     (1)  Integer
                                           Type: Domain
  (2) -> B:=3DtheIntegerType()

     (2)  (Integer)
                                        Type: AldorDomain

Is there a difference in the internal representations?

BTW, do you know why the (parenthesis) appear the result?

Yes.

Aha. See my question above about name function. So I guess
it is just a matter of knowing which sturcture to use
and when to convert, right?

If I write Domain instead of AldorDomain in your code and
compile it then I can write

  (1) -> (Integer, Float)

     (1)  [(Integer),(Float)]
                                        Type: Tuple Domain

  (2) -> ((Integer->Float),(Float->Integer))

     (2)  [(Mapping (Float) (Integer)),
                    (Mapping (Integer) (Float))]
                                        Type: Tuple Domain

it looks as if Mapping is understood by the interpreter but
the coerce to OutputForm from Tuple doesn't seem to be doing
such a good job.

Thanks for your comments.

Bill Page.

   I'll try writing this again.  After composing this once, I had a mail
client crash.

   The Planck unit system does indeed have orthogonal basic dimensions,
but this case raises an interesting point.  If you're going to use the
Planck system, you need to allow exponents of your dimensions to take on
rational values as well as integer values.  Frink doesn't allow this
currently, for performance reasons, but it may someday.  I've built unit
systems for other languages (see
http://cadswes.colorado.edu/PDF/RiverWare/WehrendPhd_Thesis2002.pdf )
and we found that our users had some units/constants defined in "square
root of length" and so on.

   Yes.  There are other ways of representing relations between units
(such as in a graph) that reduce floating-point error, but these will be
slower.

   By this I mean different classes implementing the same interface.

   I see this as a model-view distinction.

   Let me illustrate the difference through an erroneous news report
that a friend sent to me:

-----begin quote ----------------
The extended hot spell has seen temperatures cross the 50 degrees
Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) mark. Media reports said the temperature hit
52.1 degrees Celsius (125.8 Fahrenheit) in the northern town of
Kottagudam on Monday.

The temperatures are about five to seven degrees Celsius (41 to 44.6
Fahrenheit) above normal.
------end quote -----------------

   What's wrong with those conversions?

   The difference is important, so I've decided, rather than guessing
what the user means, and often guessing wrong, to be a little pedantic,
and show them how their calculation may be ambiguous, and showing them
how to fix it.

   After all, if I help someone to learn something, and think and
communicate more clearly, I've done my job.  I don't try to read minds,
and guess drastically wrong sometimes like the Google calculator does.

   Case in point.  Try to guess in advance what the Google Calculator
will return for each the following:

   1 F + 1 C
   1 K + 1 F
   1 K + 1 F + 1 F
   1 K + 2 F
   1 F + 1 F
   1 F / 1 C
   1 K - 1 C
   1 K / 1 C

   I prefer unambiguity and a wee bit of pedantry over such
unpredictable behavior.  Better to teach a man to fish, than quietly
slip a squid in his pants...

> How do you handle things like radians? 

   Radians are dimensionless numbers.  (I had a high-school teacher
repeat this three times in a row, and I realize he was talking to me.)
In the standard data file, radians are defined as 1.  However, if you
read the standard data file, you'll see how to easily make radians their
own base dimension.  I don't do this because it 1.) introduces
artificiality into calculations.  You end up multiplying and dividing by
radians in calculations just to make the units come out "right," when
they really were already right.  2.) Frink, by default, uses the base
dimensions defined by the SI.  The SI threw out radians and steradians
as base units in 1973 for similar reasons.

   That said, Frink is otherwise radians-correct.  If you change a
couple of lines in the standard data file, it enforces that arguments to
functions like sin[x] have angular dimensions, and functions like
arcsin[x] will return values with dimensions of radians.  All angular
measures will have dimensions of radians (or you can even make degrees
or gradians into the base angular type, and it'll all still work correctly.)

   Doing this properly affects the implementation of all trigonometric
functions, by the way.

   However, radians really are dimensionless numbers, and treating them
as if they're something different usually makes your calculations
unwieldy.  I allow it, and designed for it, but discourage its use.

> Work vs. Moment of Force, for
> example?

   Since these have the same units of measure, they're internally
identical.  The only time that the *name* comes into play is when Frink
prints out its "helpful" name for that combination of dimensions, or
when constraining a variable by dimensions:
http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/#ConstrainingByDimensions

   The name is otherwise unimportant.  Right now it's a 1:1 mapping,
which I might change.

   One of the most important suggestions that I can give you to help you
be "correct" is to follow the SI guidelines for reading *and* parsing
units of measure:

http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/rules.html

   These are largely unambiguous and machine-parseable.  Frink follows
these rules as its Prime Directives for "correct" usage, and the parsing
and default display routines were written appropriately.

   My tactic is "when in doubt, be pedantic."  Help your users to write
and read units of measure correctly, and you'll teach them something,
and make yourself and them look better.  If their input is ambiguous,
don't try to silently "do what I mean" and guess wrong.  Stop them and
make them write it "correctly."  Also, don't try to follow the Fortress
( http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/883 ) tactics of reinventing
the rules of mathematical precedence!

   I hope this is helpful.

X-List-Received-Date: Fri, 30 Sep 2005 03:16:44 -0000

Greetings!  In the process of releasing new Debian packages of maxima,
acl2 and axiom against gcl 2.6.7 and gcc 4.0, it has come to my
attention that there are a few errata which are prompting me to work
toward a 2.6.8 cleanup release in the near future.

Here are the primary fixes:

1) fedora has changed their address randomization again.  2.6.8pre and
   later should build on fc4 and earlier out of the box.  Thanks to
   Juho Snellman <jsnell@iki.fi> for the critical info.

2) The compiler::link build mechanism used by machines without native
   object relocation yet implemented had sufferred a bit of bit rot,
   and is now made considerably more robust.  It had earlier rather
   primitively assumed that the source and object files were in the
   same directory and were not moved before invoking compiler::link.
   Now the init function name is read from the binary object file
   itself rather than deduced from the pathname.  This restores maxima
   acl2 and axiom on mips mipsel alpha ia64 and hppa.

   This list will shrink at least to just ia64 and hppa with 2.7.0.
   As this list can shrink and grow in the future as well, it would
   make sense to avoid having to change all 4 programs in each such
   instance.  Therefore I recommend that we conditionalize the build
   based on the #+-native-reloc feature which GCl sets as appropriate.

   maxima already has an --enable-gcl-alt-link configure option.  I
   recommend merging this with the traditional option and
   conditionalizing the two code sets with #-native-reloc and
   #+native-reloc respectively.

   acl2 already has the dlopen file Matt and I have worked on
   together.  The latest Debian package does something like this:

saved_acl2: debian/patches_applied $(DLOPEN_T)
	gcl -batch -eval "(bye #-native-reloc 1)" || \
		(gcl -batch -eval '(load "debian/dlopen.lisp")' &&  $(MAKE) do_saved)
	gcl -batch -eval "(bye #+native-reloc 1)" || $(MAKE) LISP=gcl
	mv *$@.gcl $@
 
   Perhaps the equivalent can be placed in acl2's own makefiles?

   axiom had a set up patches which were used by Debian only on the
   required platforms, and BSD everywhere for a while. (The
   compiler::link alternate build mechanism works and can be tested on
   all GCL platforms, but is only required where native object
   relocation is absent.)  Here is the patch I'm using in the latest
   debian upload:

       This can obviously be cleaned up , but it appears to be working
       again on all Debian machines.  Notably, it appears that in the
       last 6 months the interpsys binary is used to compile some
       objects which are later loaded and dumped into the final
       image.  Therefore  I had to set *default-system-p* to t in
       interpsys, and then at the very end, do

	echo ")lisp (progn (setq compiler::*default-system-p* nil)(si::save-system \"foo\"))" | AXIOM=$(CURDIR)/mnt/linux $(CURDIR)/mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys && mv foo mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys
 
	Perhaps we could try once again to merge this or equivalent
	into the source proper.

3)    one GC/regexp race bug is fixed

4)    binutils is upgraded to 2.16, and built locally in Debian by
      default.

5)    Certain improvements to optimization when using compile as
      opposed to compile-file have been made.  compile, unlike
      compile-file, must refer to any literal object mentioned in the
      source by address, i.e. must not copy it.  This was achieved by
      wrapping quoted literals by `(load-time-value (si::nani
      ,(si::address object))), and was confusing the optimizer when
      special symbols like 'eql were mentioned.  we now do not wrap
      external symbols of the lisp package as per spec.


One can try out the 2.6.8 pre-release by:

export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSROOT=:ext:subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcl
cvs -z9 -q co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl

This is essentially the same code as was uploaded into Debian with
package name 2.6.7-7 in case one is interested in following it there.

Anyway, I don't plan on working on this too much, as I'd like to
finalize 2.7.0 while it is still possible.

Take care,

Peter,

This is largely just notes to myself, but if you or any
one else have comments, I would really appreciate it.

I guess the answer must be "yes" since if I use the name
Domain instead of AldorDomain and re-compile the code, this
is the result that I get:

(5) -> x1:=3D(theIntegerType(),theIntegerType())

   (5)  [(Integer),(Integer)]
                                           Type: Tuple Domain
(6) -> x2:=3D(Integer,Integer)

   (6)  [(Integer),(Integer)]
                                            Type: Tuple Domain
(7) -> x3:=3D(1,2)

   (7)  [1,2]
                                    Type: Tuple PositiveInteger

                                                   Type: Domain
(10) -> select(x2,1)

   >> System error:

-------

Back to the drawing board ...

Actually come to think of it, I don't really understand why
just renaming your AldorDomain to Domain is otherwise working
so well for me. Obviously the interpreter is calling the
OutputForm coercion for Integer from 'Domain'. And that makes
the display of Tuple of Domain happy. The tuples x1 and x2
both display the same way, but why can I only select from
the one that was created in 'Domain' but not something that
was created inside Axiom?

Hmmm... you did said earlier I think that Categories and
Domains have a different internal structure?

I suppose then that properly speaking, x1 is a Tuple of Domain
but x2 is "really" a Tuple of the type of Integer, i.e. a
Tuple of SomeCategory(...). It seems that these kinds of
objects don't play nicely with domains. But when encapsulated
in a object from the category embedded in your kind of Domain,
they do.

I cannot write:

(10) -> x:theIntegerType()

   Category, domain or package constructor theIntegerType
      is not available.

because the type of theIntegerType() is the domain Domain,
not some category which is the type of Integer. The
interpreter of course should retract this to a category.

Instead of writing 'theIntegerType()', it would be nice to
use the function you defined: 'make(Integer)'. However this
runs into a similar kind of problem as above since Axiom
does not seem to allow domains to be passed as parameters
to functions even if Aldor specifies the type of the parameter
as a category, e.g. Type. In Axiom I think the only way to
accomplish this is to pass the domain as a parameter to another
domain as shown in the following patch:

The following domain called 'Domain' provides some of the
missing functionality. It is based on 'AldorDomain' by Peter
Broadbery who writes::

Hello!

I am a member from the Singular team.
Singular is a computer algebra system for Algebraic Geometry/=20
Singularity Theory/Commutative Algebra.
It provides functionality with focus in the areas
Gr=F6bner bases (even standard bases), primary decomposition, free =20
resolutions, syzygies, polynomial equations.

We are working on providing our functionality to other systems via =20
the openmath standard.
We base our work at the moment on the polyd content dictionary.
How is the status for openmath in Axiom?
Are you interested in connecting with Singular?
Can I test your Openmath functionality (maybe some examples, since I =20
don't know axiom)?

At the moment I have written a prototype implementation for Singular, =20=

which has the core functionality of openmath and in especial provides =20=

the possibility to calculate Groebner Bases.

I hope, that this proposal could be the basis of a future cooperation.

Yours,
Michael Brickenstein=

Very interesting.

A great deal of work was done by NAG and associates a few years
ago prior to Axiom going open source. All of the hooks are
present in the current open source release and the OpenMath
modules are available but not integrated and tested with the
this release.

> Are you interested in connecting with Singular?

Yes, very interested!

As you probably already know, in addition to Axiom itself, we
also operate an online web interface to Axiom and Reduce
called MathAction, http://www.axiom-developer.org which
provides technical and user support services for the project.
MathAction is designed to be easily interfaced to other
packages and I think it would be great to include Singular.
OpenMath support should make this easier.

I would be glad to help. We seem to have been just waiting
for someone like you to come all to motivate us to complete
this part of the open source release. :)

Speaking of Singular, it has recently been added to the CygWin 
distribution! I update my CygWin installations every few days, and it is 
now working.

For the Axiom folks -- will Axiom build under CygWin?

No, not yet. The current open source distribution of Axiom
is based on GCL and GCL only builds on MSYS/MinGW to a native
Windows app. Of course that is not a problem since you can
of course run native windows apps under cygwin. It is also
possible to install both cygwin and MSYS/MinGW.

The only limitation is that on window, even with cygwin
installed, you can not use the Xwindows-based parts of
Axiom, i.e. the hyperdoc browser and graphics.

It should be possible to build a native Windows version of
GCL-based Axiom using the gcc/mingw compiler under cygwin
but the Makefiles would require some tweaking.

In principle building a full cygwin-based version of Axiom
should not be difficult since Axiom has been built on a
large number of lisp platforms, some of which fully support
the cygwin Xwindows environment. If you would like to give
this a try, I would be glad to help.

Regards,
Bill Page.

It has given me the odd headache too - worries about the upper levels of
the type hierarchies came up rarely, and there was often some more
pressing thing to worry about.

I just wrote bits of the compiler - the type hierarchy conveniently goes
away when you're worrying about code generation.  Below is some
speculation - I have not verified it against any real documentation or
code.

Just as an idea, we could explain things this way:
The 'is a type of' (ie. a: A) operation in aldor is slightly overloaded
- in the context of a domain, 'A', it says that 'a' is represented as
specifed in the domain, and that when '%' appears in the signature of
one of the operations, then a can be used there.  In the context of a
category, it means that 'a' implements the operations exported by 'A'.

As an aside, one could consider writing a language which has separate
syntaxes for these.  You could also argue that java's 'implements'
keyword is the equivalent of : at category level, but that'll be another
argument. 

Anyway, from this point of view, the type of domains is 'domain',
implementing your favourite Domain-level functions (eg. name,
findExport), while Categories are objects which mostly list exports
(they also supply default operations, but I'll ignore that).  The
operations on a category object are different - findExport makes no
sense without an underlying domain implementing the operation.  So,
you're left with 'name'(*).

Now we could if we wanted to take this to a logical extreme, implement a
category of domains, and thus allow the user to have entirely different
representations for types in the same system, and all respecting the
category hierarchy.  Luckily, (although unfortunately for asprin
manufacturers), axiom hasn't quite done this.  Instead, we have the type
of "domains" - Domain, and the type of things that list operations
returned by getOperation (ie. Categories), which must be 'SubDomain'.

This may be close to the original intention - some older timers may want
to chime in here.  It doesn't really explain 'Type' particularly, and in
fact it may be that 'Domain' was an experiment which was at least
partially supplanted by the (initially simpler) idea of a two level type
hierarchy.

(*) In fact, categories implement name, and functions for reading the
parent categories, and also behave like domains (so you can instatiate
them to get defaults).

Even if it is undefined, it has to have a value.  I'm guessing that
saying 'undefined' gives an opportunity to redesign and still be
correctly documented.

It's expecting an (aldor) domain, and it appears that mappings seem to
be represented differently.  I'd need to sit down with a debugger for a
while before answering further, I think.

I'm not 100% sure of anything, which is why I can't really be too
confident.

I think they have the same representation - you can check by tracing
'recordAndPrint', or looking for where axiom stores its result history.
They have different types, so print differently, I think (cf. Integer
and RomanNumeral for a more obvious example).

Yes - though I think the older representation should not be leaking into
the aldor world, and this might be the bug.
