Hello

In your axiom.input file add the line
 
)set message prompt frame

as the first line

You will see that the axiom.input definitions belong to the "initial" but you 
are offered a prompt belonging to a new frame. 

Give the command ")frame" to read about frames. To switch back to the frame 
that your axiom.input definitions are in, issue ")frame drop" interactively. 

What's happening is that AXIOMsys stays with the first "initial" frame but 
"axiom" starts a client process ("AXIOMsys" + "spadclient") for which 
AXIOMsys makes a new frame.

Themos Tsikas

PS. All this applies to the NAG version of axiom but it may well apply to the 
version you have.

MaplePrimes

  A new website: http://beta.mapleprimes.com has been created to offer
  a moderated community for Maple users to communicate and share
  techniques with each other.  This is a great place for all Maple
  users to interact and share their work.

Subject: [MaplePrimes] (new) 

Two of the most significant features of MaplePrimes are moderated
forums and weblogs (blogs).

The forums function much like comp.soft-sys.math.maple and other
public Maple forums, where people can post their questions and have
them answered by the community. The difference is that the MaplePrimes
forums will be monitored and moderated by Maplesoft selected community
members. And for questions that the user community cannot answer,
Maplesoft developers will be there to help as well.

The blogs allow any user to share their experiences with Maple and
mathematics. MaplePrimes provides a place where like minded people can
show off their latest findings, share Maple procedures or chat about
their favorite theorems. This is a great place for Maple application
authors to share what they are working on and to get instant user
feedback.

Throughout the site, many special features are available. The most
interesting is the ability to post mathematics in 2D notation like you
would find in a textbook. It is as easy as either entering MathML or
the Maple syntax for the math you want to appear.

Overall, we would like MaplePrimes to become the first complete
Mathematical portal. MaplePrimes should allow anyone with any Math
knowledge get help and share what they find.  We have a number of
ideas in development that will add to this.

Please go and check it out at http://beta.mapleprimes.com I hope that
you will find the site to be very useful and come back to visit often.

Subject: Ideas for "next generation" CAS

CY,

re: published summary of thoughts.

not really. it's an evolving idea. my current thinking on the subject
revolves around the "30 year horizon" and the "petamachine question".

in 30 years a researcher will have a machine with a Thz of cpu, a
TByte of storage, a PetaByte of disk space, and a Thz of bandwidth
(the so-called petamachine).  they'll have access to all previously
published literature and real-time access to currently written
materials flowing past on the connection, sort of a Napster version of
science.  so what kind of software is needed to do research?

clearly today's methods of building software cannot scale. if we
project axiom into this future situation and scale it by a factor of
100 we get 300 million lines of source, 110,000 domains, 1.1 million
functions, etc. i believe that axiom can scale much better than any
commercially available system because it is built on a better basis
(category theory). unfortunately while the theory will scale the 
current system will not.

why? many reasons. and as we think of them (this is nowhere near a
complete list of the things worth mentioning but time is short and
this margin is narrow :-) ) we need to develop research efforts to
attack these problems. even more unfortunately there is no support
for research at such fundamental levels anymore. (but we can still
do research without support)

consider what axiom "suggests" in its current form. if you look at the
inside cover of the axiom book or in src/doc/endpapers.pamphlet you'll
see an organization of the mathematics and data structures. this
raises several questions worth exploring.

  (a) is there a good graph of the categorical structure of math?
      (good w.r.t to the computational critera). we need a research
      effort to develop a classification scheme and a graph.
  (b) axiom creates categories which exist for computational reasons,
      such as RNG, but which are not reflected in non-computational
      math. we need to investigate the properties of RNG to either
      eliminate it or develop its axiomatic basis.
  (c) each of the categories, such as MONOID, have associated axioms.
      we need to "decorate" the categories with these axiom to provide
      a connection to the proof systems.
  (d) we need to examine the complete matrix of all of the 
      (category x category) and examine each function to ensure that
      it exists in the most general form as well as specific versions.
      this opens up whole research vistas of computational mathematics
      looking for specific algorithms that are more efficient than the
      general purpose case. given enough general vs specific examples
      we could develop theory that defines the classes of optimization
      and let the machine generate specific algorithms in real time.
  (e) given categories decorated with their axioms and program-proof 
      machinery we can look at the functions in each domain and begin
      to construct proofs for these functions. i believe that we could
      do this "in the small" with early categories (such as MONOID) 
      using ACL2 (which is in lisp and can be loaded into an axiom 
      image). only a lack of free time has stopped me from doing this.
  (f) we can look at specific functions from a domain in a category and 
      we can write the pre- and post-conditions. once we collect these
      into a catalog then systems like THEOREMA (Buchberger) can 
      search the catalog for algorithms that "logically cover" the
      constraints. this would allow THEOREMA to dynamically discover
      that the needed algorithm is actually "sort" or "log" and that
      axiom provides it.

PROGRAM PROOF

when we extend the ideas above and worry about the software scaling
issues it becomes clear that we need to research ways to develop
scientific algorithms from first principles. that is, we need to have
a way to specify a needed algorithm and let the machine derive a
complete, correct, valid, and verified program, possibly using logic
extended with programming constraints and technique libraries and
extensions of ACL2 toward generative rather than proof techniques.

in general this is too hard but within the axiom framework it might
be possible. since each function lives within a domain within a 
category and the domain and range of the function can be well specified
it might be possible to develop a language for algorithm specification.
i'd like to work on developing a set of group theory algorithms that
were automatically generated from the axiom category, domain, and
functional constraints. 

proceeding in this way we can think of constructing a new axiom 
library (and associated interpreter/compiler) that is provably
correct. i feel that the current method of developing software must
eventually give way to this kind of technique since it is vitally
important that we can trust the correctness of the computational
mathematics. 
  

LITERATE PROGRAMMING (Doyen)

lets move to another level of research for computational math.
currently papers are published that give algorithms in computational
mathematics. however they do not publish the actual code with the
paper. to me this is like publishing a theorem without showing the
proof. we need to change this for several reasons. ideally we should
be able to go to a conference, attend a talk, drag-and-drop the paper
from a URL and have the running algorithm and associated documentation
automatically added to our local copy of axiom.

there are some efforts on this. i've started the Doyen project 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/doyencd)
which will be a bootable CD where you will be able to do this 
drag-and-drop kind of additions to science software. Carlo Traverso
at the Univ. of Pisa is trying to start a "literate journal" that
will include source code with published papers. the ACM has been
publishing the ISSAC proceedings on CD for the past two years which
includes software (but not yet literate programs).

we are computational mathematicians and we need to publish our code.
we need to develop review standards. we need to develop code proof
requirements, termination proofs, complexity statements, code
portability standards, etc. i have permission to use a few papers
that have been published as examples of these "standards". these
will be in axiom as soon as i get the actual programs able to be
"dragged and dropped" onto the Doyen version of axiom.

given the complexity of building, maintaining, and expanding
a system as large as axiom we need to intimately combine the
theory and the code into a literate form. otherwise the expertise
that created the code will die off and we won't be able to maintain
such systems in the future. the previous generation of researchers 
have begun to retire or die and all of that expertise is lost.

SCIENCE PLATFORM (Crystal)

we currently do science in arbitrary piles (math, chemistry, physics,
engineering, etc). computational science crosses all of those boundaries.
we need to develop a science platform that can present the algorithms
to the researcher "thru a facet" that makes them seem like special cases.
for example, crystallography algorithms are mostly group theory. the
group theory algorithms should be presented to the crystallographer in
a language they understand even though the underlying algorithms are 
the same as used elsewhere (say in particle physics). so there have to
be ways to customize the display of the information to match the person
who is doing the research. the "model" of the researcher and the "model"
of the problem need to be integrated so the system can maintain the
"intensional stance" (the way the system molds itself to the researcher
and the current problem under study). this "stance" is actually a 
layer between the problem (the semantic net) and the interaction
(the crystal) mentioned below.

consider that all of the published science could now be put on a single
hard drive (except for copyright issues). each researcher could start
with this copy. since the science platform is net-connected and new
papers are being published constantly we need to develop technology 
to keep the information in some common form. there are hints of ways
to do this (see http://www.research.ibm.com/UIMA) but we need to 
stretch the bounds further. the meaning of the terms in the paper
need to be represented and extracted. the meaning of the paper needs
to be represented and extracted. all of these various levels of meaning
and their associations need to be represented. my current thinking is
to extend latex with a new set of semantic markup tools ("semtex?")
so that ideas, terms, definitions, etc can have explicit markup.

there is a technology for knowledge representation (see
http://lists.gnu.org/archives/html/axiom-developer/2003-12/msg00071.html)
that uses a "semantic network" as the primary representation. i'd like
to have a KROPS-like representation as the center of the problem.
research needs to be done to extend the dual OPS5-KREP techniques.

dragging these issues together we get the "crystal" idea. think of
the "problem" that the researcher is working on as a semantic graph
hanging in space. surround the graph with a crystal with many facets.
each facet represents a view (actually, a view-controller in the 
"model-view-controller" sense). one "facet" view might show an annotated
bibliography related to the problem. another facet might show the literate
program. another facet might be a graph of one of the functions in the
problem. another faceet might be a 3D solid model of the topological
space (math), or the bridge under construction (eng), or the molecule
(biochem). changes done in one view are globally reflected since the
semantic net is changed. changes cause automatic literature searches
(we have cpu to spare) and the system can suggest related literature.
based on feedback to the suggestions new literature is filtered (thus
the "intensional stance" of the researcher for this problem is modeled).

so developing a prototype of the crystal idea is a key research project,
at least on my version of the 30 year horizon critical path.

nobody has the political will to fund such long-term research so the
only possible way to develop this technology is thru open
source. axiom was funded for 23 years and is an amazing program. we
need to spend much more time and effort to meet the needs of the
researcher in 2035.  computational math, unlike any other software,
generates timeless software. the integral of "sin(x)" will still be
the same in 30 years.

there is much more and i really ought to put together a talk about it
at some point. perhaps once the doyen project works so i can demonstrate
the ideas.

we really should have a debate about what the future researcher needs
and how use future computers to cope with the information explosion.

if you want more comments or specific details of my local projects 
(like DOYEN, or KROPS, or CATS) just post on this list.

hope this is useful to you.

Subject: [Axiom-mail] \begin{axiom} latex on windows

I found this example on the axiom-developer mailing list from about a 
year ago:

  \begin{axiom-input}
  R1:=matrix([[cos a, sin a, 0],[-sin a, cos a, 0],[0, 0, 1]])
  \end{axiom-input}
  Next we define a rotation around the Y axis by a rotation angle of b 
  \begin{axiom-input}
  R2:=matrix([[cos b, 0, -sin b],[0, 1, 0],[sin b, 0, cos b]])
  \end{axiom-input}
  The we compose them (order is important) to form the single
  rotation equivalent to first rotating around X, then around
  the new, displaced Y. 
  \begin{axiom-input}
  R:=R1*R2
  \end{axiom-input}

I would very much like to be able to write LaTeX documents like this on 
Windows XP.  Has anyone done this?

If not, I am a bit of a Python programmer and I was thinking one way to 
make it work would be to have Python parse the tex file and take 
whatever is between the \begin{axiom} and \end{axiom} statements and 
create an input file for axiom with the output set by the file to go to 
numbered .tex files.  Python would then replace the \begin{axiom}... 
with \begin{equation} \input{....###} (i.e. the output files from axiom).

But in order to make something like this work, Python needs to be able 
to call axiom and tell it to run the script (and possibly close axiom 
afterward).  Is there a way to do this on Windows?  Can it be done with 
a dos command?

Is there an easier way?

The MathAction wiki
(http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage)
allows documents like this.  It runs on the zope server, and some code
pasted together by myself and Bill Page calls axiom on the server to
render the document.

Additionally the "pamphlet" format used natively by axiom supports

The code is all python but does not run standalone, currently.  Trivial

Hi Ryan.

To build Axiom on Windows (including those LaTeX pamphlets), I use the excellent and free software MikTeX:

  http://www.miktex.org/

I believe that Bill Page also uses that package.

Subject: GCL 2.6.7 is released

Greetings!

Stable version: 2.6.7
Testing Version: (cvs tag) Version_2_7_0t5

Greetings!  The GCL team is happy to announce the release of version
2.6.7, the latest achievement in the 'stable' (as opposed to
'development') series.  Please see http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl for
downloading information.

My apologies to Gordon Novak -- I had intended for this next stable
release to include xgcl support by default, but I have run out of
time, am leaving for a few days next week, and axiom is waiting for
the new webserver features.  xgcl does work with release as with 2.6.6
but must still be built explicitly in the xgcl2 subdirectory.  I will
try to rectify this as soon as feasible.

This release is a minor modification of 2.6.6, incorporating the known
bug fixes that had accumulated on the GCL errata page together with a
few other modifications primarily intended to provide a native
webserver feature to be used by axiom for displaying its documentation
and graphics.  The interested user is advised to consult the info
documentation on SOCKET supplied with the source.  From the
changelog:

  * Fix (listen) with readline on
  * fix control-d with readline
  * libreadline5 support for Debian
  * Support for pre-compiled regexps and new texinfo format
  * Reenable run-process
  * Push function 'accept  into lisp, use select for 'listen on socket
    streams
  * New Upstream release version
  * Native-reloc feature
  * Add daemon capabilities to server sockets, document socket and
    accept
  * Some gcl-tk fixes
  * Update wrapt-literals strategy to be consistent with CVS head --
    wrap evreything but symbols and integers, don't wrap when keeping
    the gazonk files for linking in different images, this is really a
    compile-file operation
  * gcltk demo cleanups
  * Probe-file, open_stream, and the like fail on directories
  * Resolve symlinks in truename
  * Place prototypes for defcfun in header files
  * Support for unique init names for compiler::link and the like
  * libreadline5 for Debian
  * remove _o from init-names
  * gcc-4.0 fixups
  * Bug fix: "gcl: depends on binutils-dev &lt;&lt;= 2.1.5-999), so
    uninstallable in unstable", thanks to Steve Langasek (Closes:
    #318681).  Rebuild with new release to autocompute this dep
  * Bug fix: "gcl: Please switch to po-debconf", thanks to Lucas Wall

I've not followed latest Axiom developments but as far as I know
pamphlet format is the same as noweb format (noweb is the tool used to
parse pamphlets in Axiom).

noweb home page: http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/

A single page doc: http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/onepage.ps

Some examples : http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/examples/index.html

Subject: Re: New version of jsMath

Hello again Davide,

I installed jsMath 2.0 yesterday and it is quite impressive, you've come
a long way!

As you remember, we are working on a browser-based interface to the
computer algebra system.  We have decided to incorporate the SVG and
MathML technologies for this.  While jsMath is a wonderful stepping
stone, it is too slow to render the quantity of math that would appear
in a "worksheet".

Instead, how about using jsMath to convert tex to MathML?  I tried to do
this trivially by creating a XHTML+SVG+MathML page with jsMath, but I
find:
    1) jsMath uses document.write() to add math.  this is incompatible
    with XHTML.  One should instead use DOM-based methods such as
    appendChild, removeChild, etc.
    2) jsMath uses upper case tags in all cases.  (XHTML requires
    lower-case tags)

I think full XHTML-ization of jsMath will not make it incompatible with
existing implementations that use HTML 4.0, as the DOM is still there in
both cases (with minor differences), and one would just disable MathML
when the parent DOCTYPE doesn't support it.

I tried this using your competing tool, ASCIIMathML, but frankly your
tex parsing is far superior to theirs, so I'd like to insert MathML
output into your tex parsing machinery.

I have partially XHTML-ized jsMath.js (file here:
http://mcelrath.org:9674/ZiddlyWiki2/jsMath/jsMath.js) but as I
mentioned due to document.write[ln] it will not work in XHTML.

Would you be opposed to making jsMath XHTML-compatible?  Would you be
opposed to adding a MathML rendering path?

Could you give me any pointers as to how to proceed?  I can convert your
document.write[ln]'s but I am unsure how/where to insert MathML.  I
assume in Typeset() but I keep looking at this code and it keeps being
very opaque to me.

I don't know. But since their paper is available online *and* published, I
don't think it is necessary. (You did notice that I did not document the source
at all so far...)

No, I don't know them. And in fact, after a little digging, I find that their
paper is better written than any documentation I could write. I will document
the bits of code where I depart from their paper.

Subject: Axiom/aldor interface code


Hi Tim,

I've been doing a bit more work on the aldor interface (it will now
compile 90% of the axiom library for use against aldor).  I'm at the
point of pampletising the source files, and should be done pretty soon.
Some may even be documented properly once I'm done.

I can either send patches or try to merge with an existing tla branch -
what do you prefer?

Cheers,

Pete

Oh, excuse the delay in getting back round to this.  I'm interested in
trying to get aldor working, but I think it'll take more testing &
development than I can supply in order to get it working 100%.

Pete,

Excellent. Just send me the pamphlets and I'll work on the merge piece.

re: delay. progress is not measured by time. Once I see what you've
been up to I can work out testing methods and integrate them into 
the whole.

Greg,

The process is:

   notangle i-coerfn.boot.pamphlet ==> i-coerfn.boot
   depsys (boottocl) i-coerfn.boot ==> i-coerfn.clisp
   depsys   i-coerfn.clisp         ==> i-coerfn.o

The process can fail in several ways but it appears that you have
a partially translated .boot file resulting in a truncated .clisp file.
The usually indicates a syntax error in the boot file causing the
boottocl translator to stop.

Or if the make is stopped while the .clisp file is partially written
then it will already exist (with only some of the functions translated)
and restarting the make will not retranslate the file (since it exists).

Rebuilding the system from scratch should cure the problem. I've fetched
the sources and will do another rebuild here just to check that the file
was not changed in some way.

Greg,

I've refetched and rebuilt the system from the archives and it builds
cleanly here. If you refetch and rebuild does it still fail?

Hi,

an early version of AxiomUI can be found on kaikaminski.gmxhome.de. The 
only dependency is Clisp. I use 2.34 but earlier version that are not 
too old should be fine. All Lisp libraries that are needed are contained 
in the tarball.

There is also a README with instructions. It should be as easy as 
starting a shell script.

Does not work for me.

Subject: AxiomUI code update

Hi,

with Bob's help I found out that you need at least Axiom 3.4 to run my 
code. The April 2005 binaries on the Axiom site are that version. Maybe 
this should be mentioned on the download page.

Also don't forget to set the AXIOM environment variable as described in 
the README. Alternatively you could edit the Lisp source to get the 
pathnames right.

Kai,

In your axiomui/README file you wrote:

So I thought I would give it a try. First I installed
clisp-2.34 in a directory path with no spaces c:\clisp-2.34.
I added c:\clisp-2.34 to the executables PATH and made sure
that I could run in from the MSDOS command line.

I extracted your
 http://kaikaminski.gmxhome.de/axiomui-17-08-05.tgz
to c:\axiomui. Then I modified the run.sh to the following
run.bat file:

  set AXIOMUI_STATIC_PAGES="C:\axiomui\static-pages"
  clisp -norc -i run.lisp

------

Typing 'run' produced the following result:

C:\axiomui>run

C:\axiomui>set AXIOMUI_STATIC_PAGES="C:\axiomui\static-pages"

C:\axiomui>clisp -norc -i run.lisp
  i i i i i i i       ooooo    o        ooooooo   ooooo   ooooo

There seems to be something a little non-portable involving

In run.lisp you wrote:

Perhaps you need something involving (truename ".")
which returns a real Windows path?

But I don't know enough about clisp on Windows to really
Suggest what might be going wrong here.

Subject: [WishList] Avoid Octave use Scilab

I believe there's a better, faster, more complete choice than
Octave. It is called Scilab, and it was developed by the French INRIA
(Institute Nationale De Recherche en Informatique et Automation,
IIRC), and it is in ongoing development, is very complete (even has a
simulation kit).

It is also Open Source. Octave pales in comparison as somewhat of a "toy."

Yes but Scilab is NOT free software. One day or the other, you'll pay it (see the BitKeeper issue for Linux kernel).

For reference: on scilab.org web site, FAQ section:
Q6. Is Scilab license GPL-compatible?

      According to the Free Software Foundation, Scilab is not a free software.
      See http://www.fsf.org/licenses/license-list.html#NonFreeSoftwareLicense.

I believe you should also cite Q1 from the license FAQ:

Q1. What does the Scilab license mean?     

* Scilab license allows you to:
** use freely Scilab for non commercial use
** use freely Scilab for commercial use if you do not use it as a
   derived software (ie a modified Scilab) or a composite software (ie
   Scilab included in another software).

* Scilab license forbids you to:
** use a composite or derived version of Scilab for commercial uses
   without asking INRIA authorization.

(sorry, couldn't find out how nested bullet point lists work)

This Q1 point reinforces my arguments: you cannot modify the software
without explicit INRIA's authorization. This is not Free Software. I
know that all members of Axiom community are not that sensible to Free
Software importance. However I personnally do believe that one cannot
build the 30 years horizon envisioned by Tim without using
**exclusively** Free Software (as defined by the 4 rules, not only
GPLed software). I would never invest time and knowledge in a
development where I'm not sure to keep long term control of it.

That seems to be right. Please do not forget to also set AXIOM though. 
Alternatively you could change the path to the AXIOMsys executable in 
AXIOM.LISP.

That line might well be the problem. To see what you have to put there 
you should start Clisp and evaluate *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*, because 
that is what ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* is initialized with. That should 
give you an idea of what to put there. I believe that TRUENAME only 
works on files. You could try to set another environment variable, 
AXIOMUI_ROOT say, that contains the right path and then use EXT:GETENV 
(see AXIOM.LISP) to push its content onto ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*.

I wish I could tell you more, but despite my best efforts I don't have a 
Windows machine to test. If you can get it to work please send me the 
RUN.BAT file, so that I can include it in the future.

If you have further troubles, I'm almost always on #axiom-developer.

<h3>Editing Axiom's Source Code</h3>

Emacs can be configured to make editing Axiom's source code much
easier. First of all you have to put <a
href="boot-mode.el"><tt>boot-mode.el</tt></a> and
<tt>noweb-mode.el</tt> (included in the noweb distribution, which in
turn is included in the Axiom distribution) into your
<tt>load-path</tt>. Then you add the following to your
<tt>.emacs</tt>:

<pre>
;; NOWEB-MODE
(require 'noweb-mode)

(defun kai:set-code-mode ()
  (let* ((filename (buffer-file-name)))
    (let ((end (string-match "\\.pamphlet" filename)))
      (noweb-set-code-mode
       (assoc-default (substring filename 0 end)
                      auto-mode-alist
                      'string-match
                      'fundamental-mode)))))

(add-hook 'noweb-mode-hook 'kai:set-code-mode)

;; BOOT-MODE
(require 'boot-mode)

;; AUTO-MODE-ALIST

(setq auto-mode-alist
      (list*
       '(".*\\.pamphlet" . noweb-mode)
       '(".*\\.boot" . boot-mode)
       '(".*\\.lisp" . lisp-mode)
       '(".*\\.c" . c-mode)
       auto-mode-alist))
</pre>

This code tries to automatically set the code mode in noweb, which
only works for files with names of the form
<tt>file.ext.pamphlet</tt>, where <tt>ext</tt> indicates the code
mode. For example, <tt>sockio.lisp.pamphlet</tt> would have its code
mode set to <tt>lisp-mode</tt> and <tt>nci.boot.pamphlet</tt> to
<tt>boot-mode</tt>. If the auto-detection can't decide on a mode it
uses <tt>fundamental-mode</tt>.

This is definitely a problem. The (somewhat related) ASDF-INSTALL
tutorial from Edi Weitz says the following:

Note: CLISP 2.32 cannot compile ASDF due to being not fully
ANSI-compliant. You can download a compiled version (which should work
with all operating systems supported by CLISP) from
http://weitz.de/files/asdf.fas. Newer versions (like 2.33.2) can
compile ASDF, though.


It should be enough to download that asdf.fas file from him and put it
in the same directory as run.sh, but since installing Clisp is really
easy I'd recommend that. Maybe your distribution offers newer
versions, too. The newest version is 2.34, but 2.33.2 should work as I
have used that myself in the past.

On both axiom 3.0 and 3.4 these two commands also segfault.

No problem - I'm beginning to think Axiom is where the most interesting
work on CAS will occur.  I suspect you came to this conclusion long
ago, but I'm beginning to think the Maxima source code will require
such a determined effort to improve to a decent point that it might be
best to just impliment all the features it has that Axiom doesn't in
Axiom.  I'm finding myself posting suggestions that look remarkably
like the ones you were making early on, and at some point after that
(IIRC) you popped up on the Axiom lists :-).  I sense a pattern... 
although I must say I prefer Maxima's ASCII display to Axiom's, at
least for easy reading.  I wonder how hard that would be to impliment?

Re: fixing bug - Well, I can give it a shot if it's simple to find...

Ah, yes - the Risch algorithm.  Do you happen to know if the full
algorithm is described online anywhere?  Ideally both Risch's algorithm
and the extensions by Cherry et. al. for special functions would be
formally implimented (or documented since a fair part of it must
already be present.)  Apparently nobody impliments the full algorithm
due to complexity?:  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RischAlgorithm.html  
I wonder if it's too complex for the Axiom system, given the structure
it has in place.  I've never studied it, but given how critical it is

Well, when the great fall the lesser must pick up the torch.  I need to
get ahold of some basic materials (Bronstein's books would be useful,
I'd wager :-) and get as much up to speed as my brain allows.  I need
to learn Axiom's guts anyway and this sounds like a possibly useful
way.  Maybe I could warm up by implimenting a physical units domain in
Axiom, although lord knows how I'd convince it to display things in the
form (numbers and variables)*units, or recognize Newtons out of
a*kg*b*s^-2*c*m.  Does Axiom have provisions for non-standard display
conventions and substitution like that?

Well, what you need to find out is how the Risch algorithm would handle
sin(x^2). Maybe it is simply handled by pattern matching, as exp(-x^2) is... In
this case, fixing it would be easy. Mathematica also has a representation for
sin(x^n), but I don't know whether it is "useful". (It's in terms of incomplete
Gamma functions)

Note that Axioms source is very nicely split into two parts: the "Algebra",
implementing its mathematical capabilities, and the rest (compiler,
interpreter, display, graphics, ...)

Output is easy. 

)sh OUTFORM

Pattern matching is there too.

Um:

   The )show system command is used to display information about types 
      or partial types. For example, )show Integer will show

There are two links to issue tracker on the MathAction front

Subject: Unit package question

Hi all.  I have a rather odd question, and I don't know if this is
something Axiom even will permit, but it would be useful to know, so...

I want to be able to teach Axiom how to use units.  There are a number
of surprisingly annoying features to handle based on my experience with
Maxima, and one of the worst is the following:

If I enter an expression, Axiom automatically formats it and orders it
according to internal rules.  See
http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/SandBox#msg20050819154916-0500@www.axiom-developer.org
for an example of this.  Normally, this is what one wants to do.  What
I'm not sure of is how to instruct Axiom to display things that are
Units at the end of an expression, e.g.

        kg*m
a*b*z  ------
          2
         s

In Maxima it requires some rather alarming hackery with the display
code to avoid the same default behavior Maxima exhibits.  In one sense
Axiom is an ideal place for certain types of unit operations, since I
can presumably do things like assign both inches and meters the type
Length, and assign simplification rules accordingly :-). but I don't
know how to impliment the display logic above.  Based on the Maxima
experience, I'm guessing the infastructure might not be in place to
support something like this, given it is rather non-standard in normal
mathematical environments.  Is there anybody who knows what the correct
approach to this would be?

For scientific applications of Axiom, I think units might be
very useful. My first reaction however is to try to imagine
what part of Axiom might be most suitable to represent the
concept of units.

I think what you are doing here is ok in Maxima, Maple and
Mathematica but it does not fit well in Axiom. I think it might
be quite awkward to treat units as expressions of this kind in
Axiom.

What makes Axiom different is it's strong type system and it's
object-orientation. To me this suggests that units in Axiom
might be best implemented as extensions of the Float domain.
By this I mean we should be able to write something like this:

(1) ->  (2.0::kg + 1.0::lb)::ton

   (1)  0.0027
                      Type: ton

where kg, lb and ton are Axiom domains. Given the right
definitions of these domains we should expect that Axiom would
perform the necessary coercion/conversion from the domains
kg and lb to ton, the same as if we had written:

(2) -> (2.0::Float + 1.0::INT)::SF

   (2)  3.0
                      Type: DoubleFloat

To implement something like:

(3) -> 2.0::m * 3.1::kg

          6.1
                      Type: m*kg

Axiom will have to be told how to multiply meters by kilograms.
This is easily done given Axiom function overloading. Add of
course Axiom needs to know how to construct new units (types)
from old ones. Since types are first order objects in Axiom,
this is also quite easy.

Perhaps you are confusing the notion of 'dimension' and 'unit'
here but still I think these ideas both map quite well to
Axiom's type system. For example

(4) -> 1.0::m + 2.0::s

would constitue a type error.

The display of units as types, e.g.

                      Type: m*kg

should be possible, although I think there my currently be
some built-in assumptions about type expressions that might
currently preclude this nice infix notation. But a type such
as

                      Type: Prod(m,kg)

is certainly possible.

> Is there anybody who knows what the correct approach to this
> would be?

Maple has an elaborate Scientific units and dimension system
that even takes advantage of overloading operations like + * /
such as I suggested above, although Maple does not really have
the notion of strong typing. If you have the opportunity to study
how this was done in Maple perhaps it will suggest a possible
approach in Axiom.

These are just some rough initial ideas. I am not sure how
well this concept of "units as types" will work out in
detail.

It's most likely non-trivial - I've got some digging to do into Axiom
programming philosophy.  I'll try to describe what I had envisioned in 
my mind's eye, and perhaps it will emerge what it would take to teach
Axiom to work with the new concepts.

Possibly - I'm not really sure myself yet.  But as I'll explain below
there are reasons for this approach.

The logic of units certainly has some similarities, but one needs to be
careful because there are a fair number of unique options one would
want to have with units.  I'm not sure, on closer analysis, that Floats
are really all that good a match.  I'll try to give a couple examples
below.

The problem with this is there would have to be one type/domain for
EVERY SINGLE UNIT we wished to define.  When one includes the metric
prefix system, this can include a LOT of types/domains. Conceptually, I
think it would be more elegant to have Axiom recognize a) a unit is in
an expression b) determine the dimension of each unit and confirm the
expression is dimensionally legal and c) depending on options return
either i) the unsimplified combination of legal terms ii) the
simplified expression according to a global set of user chosen standard
units (MKS by default) or iii) if non-basic dimensions like Force are
enabled, and an expression simplifies to such a dimensional type or a
combination of higher order types, simplify to the most compact form
available.  Of course, this might not be at all elegant in Axiom as it
currently exists, but here's a mockup session of what I'd like to see:

(1) -> (2.0::kg + 1.0::lb)::kg
     Error - incompatible dimensions for Add operation

(1) -> (2.0::kg + 1.0::slugs)::kg

    (1)  3.45939 kg
                                  Type: Mass
(2) -> (2.0::kg + 1.0::slugs)::slugs

    (2)  2.3704355929 53220181 slugs
                                  Type: Mass

Ideally I'd also like Axiom to be able to deal with (2.0*kg +
1.0*slugs)::kg as well, but I don't know if that would be legal or not.
 Conceptually at least, 2.0*kg and 2.0::kg are the same thing.  I'll
add more mockups below as they seem relevant.

I would like to see this feature handle things as follows (I don't know
enough about the type system to know if it could do this yet)

(3) -> (4.0::kg * 3.0::m / 6::s**-2)

             kg m
   (3)  2.0  ----
               2
              s
                                  Type: Mass*Length/Time^2
(4) -> ActivateExtendedUnitTypes(MKS)
        
   (4)  True      (not sure what the "standard" way to do this is)
                                  Type: Bool
(5) -> (4.0::kg * 3.0::m / 6::s**-2)

   (5)  2 N
                                  Type: Force
(6) -> (4.0::kg * 3.0::m / 6::s**-2)::dyn

   (6)  200000 dyn
                                  Type: Force
(7) -> (a::N)::dyn

   (7)  100000 a dyn
                                  Type: VariableForce

There are many other variations on what a user might want - for
example, after doing some calculations in N or dyne they may want to
render their forces in base units, but cm*g/minute^2 rather than MKS. 
Options to set defaults for and override locally all of these
simplifications are needed.  Assignment checking is also needed - for
example, in the last example above a should only be assigned quantities
of type Force.  However, any Force type is legal and should be accepted
and converted as controlled by settings.

> Perhaps you are confusing the notion of 'dimension' and 'unit'
> here

Possibly - I get a bit loose with my terminology sometimes, which won't
do in the Axiom world :-).  To be clear - each unit is associated with
a dimension, and I would like to see the rules governing unit
interactions work on the dimension level, while handling the conversion
between different units with the same dimension automatically based on
circumstances as determined by either default settings or the user's
preferences.

Right - essentially Axiom's strict typing gives us a chance to have
dimensional analysis as part of all calculations :-).

Right, but as I showed in my examples above my preference is for the
units to remain as a displayed part of the expression, and the Type
information to report the dimension of the quantity in question.  This
seems to me to be the most useful thing to do.

I have looked at the Maple package, and indeed they use many similar
ideas to ones I had arrived at (after much trial and error) in the
Maxima design.  (Boy was that embarassing - a real lesson to do my
homework before beating my head against the nearest wall!)  How it's
ideas map into Axiom's strong typing system is, unfortunately, the real
nut to crack.  Axiom's system offers some exciting possibilities, but
it looks like there might be some roadblocks to plow through too.

I should mention that Maple has the idea of things like (IIRC) unit
space where expressions are encapsulated in a Units() denotation, e.g.
4*z*Units(kg*m/s^2).  This was rejected for the Maxima package - we
felt that the program should be able to handle the "textbook"
                        kg*m
formatting style of 4*z ---- since this is the convention used 
                          2
                         s
almost universally in the sciences (who are most likely to be dealing
with units.)  I have the same hope for Axiom - units, as multiplicative
factors, remaining part of the expression, and the Type information
working on the dimension level.  (As in my examples above.)

It might be that that would be the best "mapping" of the idea onto
Axiom's system, although aesthetically I prefer the idea of working
with dimensions and units providing the multiplicative factors for
conversion between each other.  Discussion welcome.

Cheers,

P.S. - there's also the whole idea of error analysis which enters into
this equation - for example, when discussing physical quantities 2.0
has a significance - you are implying a greater measurement accuracy
than just stating 2.  So there may be a collision in the future between
float and integer behavior in Axiom and the handling of accuracy.  For
example, if I have a measurement of 10+-2 and I subtract the quantity
4.0007+-0.0005, the proper return (if I've got this right - it's been a
while) would be 6+-2, since error analysis combining the two errors
would result in 2 + <small amount>, and significant figure rules say to
chop off the <small amount>.  Anyway, there are rules governing such
things and I suspect there might be a collision between those and
"normal" mathematical convention, where all things are exact.  Then
there's the whole issue of errors introduced by the CAS itself, due to
precision limits and such. But that's for another day.

I have exactly the same problem with axiom--main--1--patch-44 on Gentoo 
Linux 2005.1.

In the Makefile in the doc directory, making DeveloperNotes.dvi indeed 
includes some if [ <something> ]; but the arguments of [ seem correct - I 
cannot understand this strange behaviour.

With the fixedPoint script, I noticed that the old database

You are correct. The src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet that I am using
on the axiom--windows--1 branch has been updated to properly rebuild
the databases if any of the *.NRLIBS/code.o files change. In the
linux branches (e.g. axiom--main--1) the database build is still
done via a kludge that requires you to delete the file called
`dbcomplete' in order to force a rebuild. Alternately you could
also delete the int/*.spad files which will force them to be
re-extracted from the pamphlet files and also trigger deletion of
the dbcomplete file.

I browsed the web a little more and came to the conclusion that the
Risch algorithm only deals with elementary functions whose integral is
elementary, too. "Clearly" (looking at maxima's output or browsing the
web), $sin(x^2)$ does not have an elementary antiderivative. Hence, I
suspect that it should be treated just as $e^{-x^2}$, by the
'PatternMatchIntegration' package. This would not be too difficult,
probably.

Although this does not really solve the original problem, I think I found a bug in 'INTPM'. Currently, there is an operation::

           pmComplexintegrate(f, x) ==
             (rc := splitConstant(f, x)).const ^= 1 =>
               (u := pmintegrate(rc.nconst, x)) case "failed" => "failed"
               rec := u::ANS
               [rc.const * rec.special, rc.const * rec.integrand]
             cse := (rec := matcherfei(f, x, true)).which
             cse = ERF  => [rec.coeff * erf(rec.exponent), 0]
             "failed"

It is pretty obvious that the third line should read::

           (u := pmComplexintegrate(rc.nconst, x)) case "failed" => "failed"

instead. If we perform this change, we get instead of
\begin{axiom}
complexIntegrate(-%i/2*e^(%i*x^2),x)
\end{axiom}

the correct answer, same for
\begin{axiom}
complexIntegrate(%i/2*e^(-%i*x^2),x)
\end{axiom}

For some reason, it still won't do 
\begin{axiom}
complexIntegrate(sin(x^2),x)
\end{axiom}

Curiously, the pattern matcher is not even invoked in this case... Even if we enter the integral as
\begin{axiom}
complexIntegrate(-%i/2*e^(%i*x^2)+%i/2*e^(-%i*x^2),x)
\end{axiom}
it fails, although in this case the pattern matcher is invoked. It would need to be invoked on each summand seperately, though.

The problem is in 'expintegratepoly$INTTR'. There you find the following definition::

  -- returns either
  --   (q in GP, a in F)  st p = q' + a, and a=0 or a has no integral in F
  -- or (q in GP, r in GP) st p = q' + r, and r has no integral elem/UP
      expintegratepoly(p, FRDE) ==
        coef0:F := 0
        notelm := answr := 0$GP
        while p ^= 0 repeat
          ans1 := FRDE(n := degree p, a := leadingCoefficient p)
          answr := answr + monomial(ans1.ans, n)
          if ~ans1.sol? then         -- Risch d.e. has no complete solution
               missing := a - ans1.right
               if zero? n then coef0 := missing
                          else notelm := notelm + monomial(missing, n)
          p   := reductum p
        zero? notelm => [answr, coef0]
      [answr, notelm]

In principle, this function takes a polynomial 'p' and tries to
integrate every coefficient. If it finds an answer, it adds it to
'answr', otherwise to 'notelm'. Note however, that the constant term
of the 'p' will never get added to 'notelm', even if it was not
possible to integrate it. So maybe the last line should read::

      [answr, notelm+monomial(coef0, 0)]

This seems to "work", i.e., the integrals are then returned
unevaluated. However, I'd rather have axiom to use the linearity of
the integral...  Note that

\begin{axiom}
integrate(exp(-x^2)+sin(x),x)
\end{axiom}

is an example for an integral where 'coef0' does not vanish but
'notelm' does. So the more drastic change::

          if ~ans1.sol? then         -- Risch d.e. has no complete solution
               missing := a - ans1.right
               if zero? n then coef0 := missing
               notelm := notelm + monomial(missing, n)
          p   := reductum p
        zero? notelm => [answr, coef0]
      [answr, notelm]

is not necessary - but does not produce wrong results either.

By the way, here are some other - strange - manifestation of the same bug:

\begin{axiom}
integrate(exp(-x^2)+1/x,x)
integrate(exp(x)/x+1/x,x)
\end{axiom}

Although $1/x$ is certainly elementary, and so is its integral, the bug manifests itself.

There is another issue I don't quite understand. Currently axiom
returns the whole integral unevaluated if it does not manage to
evaluate it completely. If it were not for the bug #199, the following
were an example:

\begin{axiom}
integrate(exp(x)/x+exp(-x^2)+1/log(x),x)
\end{axiom}

Although axiom produces the intermediate result
'integrate(exp(x)/x+exp(-x^2),x)+li(x)', it discards it. The
responsible line of code is in 'rinteg$FSINT' ::

    rinteg(i, f, x, h, comp) ==
      not elem? i => integral(f, x)$F
      empty? rest(l := [mkPrimh(f, x, h, comp) for f in expand i]) => first l
      l

Does this make sense?

The same problem exists in 'AN'. Although the test for zero in this
domain is mathematical, we have

\begin{axiom}
sqrt(2)<sqrt(3/2)
\end{axiom}

Note that the domain 'RealClosure' is designed to handle such

'AN'. So, wouldn't it be appropriate to make 'AN' a wrapper for
'RECLOS FRAC INT'? Of course, the appropriate conversion routines

However I could not get the KDE Konqueror web browser to execute

Firefox worked fine though.

Subject: Re: Unit package question

I would rather suggest to write a package

Mass(R: Ring): Ring == add { ... }

where Ring should actually be something that allows Float to be entered 
for R. Maybe even

Mass(T: with {
   +: (%, %) -> %;
   *: (%, %) -> %;
   ...
})(R: T): T == add { ... }

would be a good idea.
(Well, that is Aldor syntax, but I hope in can be understood.)

In the "add" part the units could be implemented as variables (together 
with some rules to convert from kg to ton or so) of a polynomial domain.
The output would be entirely left to the Mass domain. And the advantage 
of that approach would be that one could have also variables in the 
domain parameter R. Nothing prevents it from being something like a 
polynomial domain. One only has to take care that variables and units 
are separated accordingly.

Then I could imagine to write

kg:=kilogramm$Mass(Float);
ton:=ton$Mass(Float);
mass:=7.3 * ton + 4.3 *kg

which would print in kg, say, as the standard format.

7304.3 * kg
                           Type: Mass(Float)

If you like to see this in tons then say, for example,
convert(mass, ton).

Well... that is just a thought.

If you like more units than just mass, I think, it would be reasonable 
to write a Unit domain similar to the Mass domain given above 
incorporating also seconds, hours or whatever.

Best regards

in fact, I like this idea even better than mine. In private communication, we

Subject: Re: Axiom/aldor interface code

Hi Tim,

Finally managed to get the interface running and building from pamphlets
properly.  I've attached two files - there is a tar file which should be
unpacked in axiom/src - this contains an 'aldor' directory.  The patch
file contains some minor (but important) changes to files in src/interp.

Typing 'make' in the aldor directory should kick the build off.  It
takes less than an hour on my 2Ghz pentium.

To build, you'll need java, and aldor 1.0.2 set up.  

I've tried to document how the makefiles fit together in the .pamphlet
files, hopefully some of them will make a form of sense.  Basically, the
idea is that the build uses a small java program to dynamically
determine dependencies, and then let make deal with compilation order.  

Minor changes: I've changed where axiom looks for the aldor files - they
go to $AXIOM/aldor, not $AXIOM/compiler, mostly 'cos compiler is too
ambiguous.  The other changes are simple bug fixes.

For testing, I've appended a very stupid aldor domain (the maths inside
is not meant to be taken seriously; 'tis a silly idea that can't work).
The file contains a short test script at the end.

Pete.

Pete,

I read "Recursive Make Considered Harmful" and he makes some good points.

In Axiom's case I'm not sure that a single, mother-of-all-files, Makefile
is a workable solution. 

First, he claims that a single Makefile is more efficient. But the Makefile
lookup/DAG build is swamped by the size of the Axiom build in the "clean"
case and a "make" of Axiom with a single file changed is very fast.

Second, he claims that the DAG edges get missed when recursive makes
are used. That is probably true in C using include files. He proposes
some solutions (VPATH, GCC -MM) that are not useful for lisp. Axiom
does have some "include"-like issues because lisp macros have to be
in the compile environment at the correct time. You'll notice that Axiom
builds "depsys". This is an image that includes the macros that are used.
Depsys is used to compile the Axiom lisp code where needed. Thus the
"include"-like issue is handled. Changing a depsys file will likely
trigger a complete system rebuild because it is very hard to compute
the macro vs file dependency tree. I certainly don't want that tree
expressed (and hand maintained) in the Makefile stanzas.

Similarly in the algebra subdirectory I originally started using the
Makefile stanzas to decide what needs to be recompiled. Given 1100
domains and their various dependencies this is impractical. In fact,
I would claim that hand-maintaining any dependency graph with 1100
nodes cannot work. And it clearly cannot scale. If Axiom grows by a
factor of 100 over the next 30 years that would mean 110000 stanzas
with who-knows-how-many dependencies.

Third, he misses a key point. While recursive makes are inefficient
they are conceptually manageable. Axiom is a huge system and some of
the Makefiles used to exceed 40000 lines (which brought Bill Page to
open rebellion and rightly so. I used a scheme which had a file-per-stanza
and his scheme uses generic rule patterns). I understand the details of
building Axiom and have expressed the process as clearly and correctly
as possible (modulo some complexity still to be handled like fixed-point
compiles). The directory structure and their associated Makefiles
reflect that understanding.

If I were to combine the Makefiles into one Mother-Makefile it would
probably total 100000 lines which would be a HUGE rule-based program
(maybe the largest I've ever seen and I authored a rule-based programming
language at IBM).

Recursion allows me to dole out the tasks in slightly more manageable
conceptual chunks. Each subdirectory only cares about itself and its
children so the frame of reference is localized.

I'll trade program inefficiency for clarity any day. As for "cross
directory dependency" I used "trigger files" to indicate that a
rebuild is needed. For instance, src/interp/Makefile has the 
'database.date' marker which is touched if the databases get
rebuilt and interpsys needs to be regenerated.

Miller assumes that you can code all of your dependency information
in the Makefile stanzas. In any really complex project this is not
possible (try hand-coding the axiom algebra lattice).

Miller rails against the practice of writing procedural control
related shell scripts in Makefiles which undermine the whole concept
of a rule-based programming language. On this point I agree wholeheartedly.

I've also tried hard to avoid all uses of special tools such as
#if, common includes, dynamic includes (well, 'findSpadFiles' in
src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet is an exception), and other computed
approaches. Given the one-stanza-per-file method it turns out that
make has very little to do except stat files and build the well-specified
DAG.

In any case, I'm happy to see you didn't include a patch which rewrote
all of the Makefiles into one big Makefile. I'm old and my heart would
not stand such a shock.

Pete,

I'm looking at your patches and reading them in detail.

You mention a shell variable 'ALDORROOT' but don't tell me what
value it is expected to have (a) at compile time and (b) at runtime.

I'm assuming that the aldor compiler will be in 
  mnt/linux/bin
and the libraries would be in 
  mnt/linux/lib


Also in the Makefile.pamphlet you set:

INTERPSYS := ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/depsys

Is this what you intended? Why?

I did learn the difference between '=' and ':=' in Makefiles from
your comments so I'll look at back-fitting this into the system
where appropriate.

more questions to follow...

No problem - I've a project which is suitable for non-recursive
makefiles, and nicked the structure from there.  As you say, axiom in
its entirety is not really the kind of thing that can be tackled this
way.  The reference to 'considered harmful' was just to a similar style,
not signalling any intent to change existing code, and I've no argument
with your assesment below.

In the case of the aldor library the non-recursive part is less
important than the ability to list a bunch of files and have make sort
out what targets you mean;  this way I don't need to autogenerate
stanzas, and the build will include new types as they are added to
src/algebra.  Both of these should reduce the amount of maintenance
required by libaxiom, which was an important goal.

ALDORROOT is the location of your aldor distribution; it should always
be set to the place where aldor is installed on your machine - in the
NAG days we could install aldor within the axiom tree - I'm guessing
that this isn't viable with different licenses for the two systems. 

Fortunately the two things are fairly loosely coupled; I don't see any
reason for the aldor lisp generator to change dramatically, and axiom's
requirements are pretty stable. Moving versions should be less painful
than changing lisps for example.

Not sure; I've probably just taken liberties with the conventional
names;  It should be depsys of course.  I probably initially used
interpsys, and then ran into a problem and changed the definition and
not the name.

OK - will try to reply quickly, but I'm out and about fairly frequently.

NB: As expected, I missed a bunch of files and certain ones need to have
'document' run on them explicitly - I'll try to prepare a makefile which
explicitly does the document thing first; attrib.as.head.pamphlet
contains a minor error in the \author line; & should be a comma or
something.

Well, about as well as I understand Axiom's syntax... :-/.  I might as
well ask this up front, and I'm sorry in advance if I missed something
obvious and/or am proving myself as intelligent as your average rock:

Is there a tutorial or some such that takes a Category->Domains set of
code and dissects it essentially character by character, answering all
the dumb questions?  Here are some of the ones floating around in my
head which I don't know quite how to answer at the moment.  I'm quite
aware these are an indicator I haven't read and understood something I
need to, so if someone can point me to the correct "Axiom for Dummies"
file I'll be only too glad to fade away until I understand it properly.

Taking this example:

Units(R: Field): Exports == Implementation where
  U == Fraction Polynomial Integer


1)  The syntax (R: Field) - what does this actually denote?  R I guess
is all Rings?  I don't know how to parse this statement - is : a
separator, an indicator that R is being restricted to Field (whatever
that is) or what?  Why is it there at all - I'm assuming it has
something to do with letting Axiom know about the existence of the idea
of <something>*Units?

2)  Exports == Implementation - what is actually being exported here,
and where is it being exported to?

3)  U == Fraction Polynomial Integer  I'm assuming this is part of the
Export - I'm also guessing the $U at the end of the units.spade file
somehow ties off the domain definition?

4)  What is the significance of "%" within a domain definition?

5)  Is there a file in the mnt/linux/doc directories somewhere that
gives a detailed description of the syntax of Axiom's spad code? 
Clearly I need to write a new parser in my head.

What does it mean to define "Exports" from a Category or Domain?  Are
Exports visible to the user on the command line or do they manifest
themselves in the parent Category?

If "Domains" are to be part of a "Category", what responsibilities do
the Domains have to a) label themselves as being part of a category b)
export anything back to the Category?  Can a Category demand certain
abilities or actions be defined for a Domain in order for it to be a
legal part of the Category?

The gotchas there (which I suppose might be sidesteped somehow and I'm
not seeing it):

There are a LOT of conversions to implement.  This is a significant
part of the grunt work of creating a units package, once the core logic
is in place.  At an absolute minimum, I would suggest having a "pivot"
unit defined for each dimensional domain and define all units in terms
of the pivot unit.  Then the autoconverters can do two conversions and
the definitions file is only 2*n instead of n^2 in size.  I got fancy
in Maxima and handled metric prefixes automatically, but Martin didn't
think that would be a good idea here.

Each "unit" domain (or more properly, dimension domain that defines a
non-basic dimension) needs to know enough about the other domains to
spot significant unit combinations, if we add derived units like Force
into the picture. (We need to for any non-trivial use of a serious
Units package.)  So if we define a Mass domain, a Length domain, and a
Time domain can we somehow define a derived domain which recognizes and
handles the combination Mass*Length/Time^2 as Force?

This we would want to create as the "units database" for the default
package.  Ideally, loading or activating the units package should have
all those definitions prepared and ready.

It's a good thought, and is similar in some respects to what I tried in

>From what little I do understand, I like this idea the best of any so
far.  I would call the category Dimensions, since that's what Mass,
Time and Length denote - they are not units until a specific quantity
like 1 kg, 1 sec and 1 meter is defined.  I would define in each domain
a "pivot unit" - this will be the unit that all other units defined in
the domain will need to be defined in terms of.  (Not necessarily by
the user - I'm sure Axiom could process inches defined as a Length in
terms of centimeters into an internal definition of inches in terms of
meters (probably the most logical pivot unit for Length, although any
could be made to work.)  This maps well into defining units easily and
correctly, since each unit defined can be identified as being part of a
unique domain. Then the rules for using it become instantly clear,
being handled at the dimension level, which with the possible exception
of temperature need not and should not concern itself with the details
of converting between units - at that level the rules for dimensional
analysis can be put in place.  After that it's mostly knowing what's
related to what by what ratio, after all.  Then variables can be
defined as being part of the Mass domain, and only accept as
assignments units which are also part of the Mass domain.  Perhaps, if
this logic makes sense at the Category level, an awareness of the
relationships of domains could be encoded.  Simplification of base
dimension combinations into derived combinations is a tricky thing to
create a workable interface for - you have to allow the user to say
things like "I want to simplify base units to Energy when possible, but
not to Force" and then allow them to change their minds later.  Then if
they want you to simplify to BOTH Energy and Force (not a readily
physical situation but it should be handled since predicting all
meaningful unit combinations is an exercise in futility) you must first
check for Energy, and then Force, else you simplify to Force first and
then don't recognize that Force+remaining base dimensions allows for a
further simplification to Energy.  Ideally Axiom would know this, but
it gets tricky because you don't want to ONLY know about simplifying a
dimensional quantity containing Force to Energy - what if the user has
disabled simplifications to Force?  You need to be able to recognize
Energy out of "lower level" dimensions as well...  The answer to this
in Maxima was to define an "order of searching" for derived dimensions,
and then reduce all expressions internally to base units for the
search.  I don't know the best way to approach this in Axiom.

Dear C Y,

I think most of the answers you find in the Aldor User Guide.
http://www.aldor.org/AldorUserGuide/
http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/index.html

But let me perhaps say a few things in my own words.

>> Mass(R: Ring): Ring == add { ... }

That is nothing else than the definition of a function Mass.
See http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap6.html
Remember (almost) everything in Aldor is a first class object. So Aldor
allows you to take domains as a parameter and to return a domain. Ring
is a category (in the library Algebra distributed with Aldor) and it is
the type of R. So whenever you want to call Mass(SOMETHING) this
SOMETHING must be of category Ring. That means it has to export all the
functions that show up in the definition of Ring.
(Look for the definition here:
http://www-sop.inria.fr/safir/WHOSWHO/Manuel.Bronstein/algebra/index.html)

>> Mass(T: with { +: (%, %) -> %; *: (%, %) -> %; ... })(R: T): T ==
>> add { ... }

That one is in fact a bit more complicated. It is a function that
returns a function that returns a domain. I think, it would have also
worked if I had written

Mass((T: with {
    +: (%, %) -> %;
    *: (%, %) -> %;
    ...
}, R: T): T == add { ... }

(A function with two parameters that returns a domain...)

That goes in Aldor under the name of "dependent type".

Well that code is from Martin, I guess. But yes, it is intended to say
that this <something> is an element of type R and such an R must at
least have all the field properties (ie the signatures of Field).

That parametrization makes the code more flexible. You could leave out
this (R: Field) stuff and restrict to use Float all over, but then you
would have to implement another domain if you come to the problem that
instead of floats you would also like to allow variables.

> 2)  Exports == Implementation - what is actually being exported here,
>  and where is it being exported to?

Exports and Implementation come later in the code. You have not given
them here.

> 3)  U == Fraction Polynomial Integer  I'm assuming this is part of

coerce((x::Rep).units)$U means "call a function (here coerce) from the
domain U". That is simply to help the compiler. Sometimes it happens
that there is a function f: A->B from domain D1 and f: A->B from D2 in
scope. You would not like the compiler to choose for you. (Aldor would
reject compilation in such a case. You would have to make your
intentions clear by saying f$D1 or f$D2.)
Look for $ on the page http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap7.html

> 4)  What is the significance of "%" within a domain definition?

Simply translate it to THISTYPE. If you say

Foo(T: with {random: () -> %}): with {random: () -> %} == add {
   Rep == T;
   random(): % == per random();
}

then you could use Foo(Integer) and Foo(MachineInteger) and the % would
in the first occurence be like T (ie Integer or MachineInteger) and in
the second occurence like Foo(T) (ie like Foo(Integer) or
Foo(MachineInteger)). Think of it as a placeholder.

The line
random(): % == per random();
basically says:
in order to define random for Foo(T) use the function random from T.

Well, unfortunately, spad syntax is not exactly the same as Aldor
syntax. It is reasonably close, but there are things that the Aldor
compiler does not allow. (Which is good.)

Take for example the line
x * y  == [(x::Rep).expr  * (y::Rep).expr,
            (x::Rep).units * (y::Rep).units]

As spad code that would be OK (I have not checked it), as Aldor code it
is unacceptable. You have to give the types for x, y and the return
type, ie you would have to write

(x: %) * (y: %): % == ...

You might say, the compiler should be smart enough to fill in missing
information if it is extractable from the environment. Well, sometimes,
for example, for polynomials you migth want to have a function

(x: R) * (y: %): % ==

where R would be the type of coefficients. Now you have two * functions
and reading the code would be quite confusing if both these functions
start via "x*y==...". I think it is good practice too be a bit more
explicit. (Sometimes it's humans that read the code.)

> What does it mean to define "Exports" from a Category or Domain?

I am not quite sure that I understand the question. In the definition of
> Units(R: Field): Exports == Implementation where

the Exports are the functions/constants you see when Units(...) comes
into scope. I think that is called "expose" in Axiom terms. In Aldor you
would say "import from Units(...);" and then you can use the functions
from Units, ie, its exports without using the $Units(..) syntax.

What is the parent Category here?

I would opt for a general Unit domain instead of a domain for Mass, 
Length, etc. I somehow fear that Mass*Length (id Domain times Domain) is 
hard to work with. Implementation should be no problem, but I fear to 
convert from such a form into Force could lead to problems. Anyway, such 
a Metadomain would know about combinations of the basic domains and you 
have a Unit domain again which knows about all units.

Never ever say something like this. It is *good* to ask questions, and it is
also good to ask stupid questions. Moreover, it is impossible to tell
beforehand whether a question is stupid or not. In my opinion, there are no
stupid questions. (The reason for my saying that stupid questions are good

There is the Aldor user guide: http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/index.html which
is very thorough but maybe a little steep, so I think the following approach is
better for a beginning:

No. R is a identifier, a variable in the computer language sense. So the syntax
is

Name0(Name1: Type1, Name2: Type2, ...): NameA == NameB where

and Type1, Type2, ... are Types like 

* Field, Ring, ... which are categories, in this case Name1 will be taken by
  axiom to denote a domain of category Type1. Example:

------------------------------------------------
Units(R: Field): Exports == Implementation where
------------------------------------------------

R will be some Field from now on. I.e., you can multiply, add and take inverses
of the elements in R. 


* Integer, Polynomial Integer, PrimeField 5, ... which are domains, in which
  case Name1 will be taken by axiom to denote an element of Type1. Example:

-----------------------------------------------------
SquareMatrix(ndim,R): Exports == Implementation where
  ndim : NonNegativeInteger
  R    : Ring
-----------------------------------------------------

ndim will be a NonNegativeInteger and R a Ring. A valid call would be

0$SquareMatrix(5, Polynomial Integer)

which will give a 0 matrix of dimension 5 with entries (all zero) which are
Polynomials with Integer coefficients. Note that you are allowed to put the
type declaration also after the keyword "where".

Another example

------------------------------------------------
PrimeField(p:PositiveInteger): Exp == Impl where
------------------------------------------------

Here p will be a PositiveInteger. A valid call would be

characteristic()$PrimeField(5)

an invalid call would be

characteristic()$PrimeField(x)

unless x *is* an integer at the time of evaluation. 

 > 2) Exports == Implementation - what is actually being exported here, and
 > where is it being exported to?

"Exports" and "Implementation" are just two identifiers. If you read the
sources, you will sometimes also find

     Cat == Capsule

or 

     Cat == Definition

It seems that writing 

     Category ==

is reserved for categories.

So the complete syntax is (incomplete, but useful)

Name0(Name1: Type1, Name2: Type2, ...): NameA == NameB where

  NameA == with

    op1Declaration

    op2Declaration

    op3Declaration

  NameB == add

    op1Definition

    op2Definition

    op3Definition

The keyword 

* "==" means: here comes a macro definition 

* ":" means: here comes a type declaration

* ":=" means: here comes an assignment. 

So we could also write

Name0(Name1: Type1, Name2: Type2, ...): with

    op1Declaration

    op2Declaration

    op3Declaration

  == add

    op1Definition

    op2Definition

    op3Definition

except the indentation is then less clear.

The keyword "with" means: here come declarations the user will see. Note that
the with part may be missing. See below.

The keyword "add" means: here come definitions, declarations and assignments
the user will not see.

It means: I am an element of this domain.

This comes just before the "with" part. (If it is present...). An example is

PrimeField(p:PositiveInteger): Exp == Impl where
  Exp ==> Join(FiniteFieldCategory,FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField($),_
    ConvertibleTo(Integer))
  Impl ==>  InnerPrimeField(p) add
    if not prime?(p)$IntegerPrimesPackage(Integer) then
      error "Argument to prime field must be a prime"

Thus: PrimeField will be an element of the categories

FiniteFieldCategory, FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField($), and
ConvertibleTo(Integer)

(all quite reasonable, isn't it? "$" is the same as "%", as far as I know)

It does not have any additional operations exported -- apart from the
operations it inherits from FiniteFieldCategory, FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField
and ConvertibleTo(Integer).

 > b) ... Can a Category demand certain abilities or actions be defined for a
 > Domain in order for it to be a legal part of the Category?

Yes. ALL operations defined by the category must be implemented. However, you
can define a default implementation in the category itself. For example:

SemiGroup(): Category == SetCategory with
    --operations
      "*": (%,%) -> %                  ++ x*y returns the product of x and y.
      "**": (%,PositiveInteger) -> %   ++ x**n returns the repeated product
                                       ++ of x n times, i.e. exponentiation.
      "^": (%,PositiveInteger) -> %    ++ x^n returns the repeated product
                                       ++ of x n times, i.e. exponentiation.
    add
      import RepeatedSquaring(%)
      x:% ** n:PositiveInteger == expt(x,n)
      _^(x:%, n:PositiveInteger):% == x ** n

Here you find a default declaration of taking the n-th power that is valid for
SemiGroups. It will be overridden (i.e., implemented differently) by some
domains, of course.

To define

a * b

where a is of domain Mass and b of domain Time you probably need the Product
domain. The signature will be (I forgot to say: "++", "+++" and "--" are three
different kinds of comments...

)abb category DIM Dimension
Dimension(F: Field): Category == with

  "+": (%, %) -> %
  ++ elements of units can always be added

  "*": (F, %) -> %
  ++ elements of units can always be multiplied with a scalar

)abb package PRODDIM ProductDimension
ProductDimension(A: Dimension, B: Dimension): Exports == Implementation where

  "*": (A, B) -> Product(A, B)

But I'm not yet sure how you can define

a / b

where a is of domain Mass and b of domain Time...

OK.  What about this - have two domains, Dimensions and Units.  Have
Units depend on Dimensions and define its units in terms of Dimensions.
 Is this allowed?  This would separate things conceptually and would

I would rather say that Axiom is the subset. The advantage with Aldor is
that it is a real programming language. You know, it developed from
Axiom and Peter Broadbery even seemed to have opened the stage for
programming extensions of Axioms Algebra library in Aldor (not SPAD).

Aldor is much clearer than SPAD. You will agree on that when you later
have to understand what you once have written in SPAD.

I think you should try to ask Stephen Watt, whether the Aldor compiler
will ever become open source. He claims that there is still some
copyright issues to be solved. But I don't know which. Maybe it helps if
many people ask him for opensourcing it. I would be very much in favour
of it. Peter Broadbery once worked with NAG on Aldor and I think he
could do wonderful things with making the Aldor compiler better. Anyway
at least he could document the code properly that he added to the
compiler. So I rather ask you to help making Aldor free.

Right. The reason is: what do ALL dimension domains have in common? I
cannot think of a single function, except, maybe "convert".

Ah, I've heard of dimensional analysis once. That rather checks whether
the type of the result has the correct format. Oh, that somehow seems to
suggest the domain way. But first explain. And maybe let me sleep then a
night about it.

Well, yes, but as far as I understand you want to distinguish the type
of the units (length, time, mass, etc.). So maybe the metadomain 
approach would be a good idea.

Aldor and Spad are quite similar. Ralf already pointed out one of the
differences. In Aldor you may choose between "pile" syntax, which is the syntax
used by Spad, i.e., blocks are defined by indentation and C like syntax, where
blocks are defined by pairs of braces. In Spad you have to use "pile" syntax.

You can already write your stuff in Aldor syntax and use it for Axiom. In this
case your file must have the extension .as and you have to have Aldor
installed. Furthermore, you probably need to follow the instructions from the
last comment (by myself) in

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/37CoAldorFileDoesNotWork

However, Peter Broadbery seems to have updated his patches and distributed them
this week on the list. I did not try them yet.

One big difference between Aldor and Spad is, that Spad only implements a
subset of Aldors grammar. In my opinion, the two most important points are

* dependent types in full generality, i.e., in Axiom the following signature is
  currently illegal:

  test(n: Integer) -> IntegerMod(n)

  In some cases, this is a show stopper, I'd say. Although William Sit has
  argued that it can be emulated in Axiom, but I'm not really convinced. If you
  look for Marcus Better on the mailing list axiom-math and axiom-developer,
  you will find that his question was in the end not answered. (And I still
  don't know how to do it...)

* the extend keyword is missing. This is explained in detail by the Aldor
  documentation.

Another big difference between Aldor and Axiom are the libraries. Very
unfortunately, the libraries are quite incompatible, as far as I know. So, if
you want to use your program in Axiom, you will need to use the Axiom library,
which is no problem, fortunately.

My sincere hope is that we will somehow be able to make the libraries
converge. This probably means to spend a lot of time thinking about a good
design. I'm quite sure that the Aldor library are better designed, but on the
other hand, a lot of things are missing. So I think we have to look which
domains from Aldor can be integrated in the Axiom type hierarchy. A big
project, which is probably feasible, are the polynomial categories and domains.

However, before this can be done, there is a problem with licensing. We would
need to convince Stephen Watt to free Aldor. I know from private Communication
that Manuel Bronstein was very much in favour of this step, but Stephen Watt
has not been very responsive yet...

If -- alas -- it is not possible to free Aldor, I think the best thing to do
would be to hire a lisp guru who implements the Aldor extension for us. I don't
think that this would be too difficult, and in fact, it would make sense in any
case, whether Aldor becomes free or not.

I suggest that we write a signed petition to Stephen Watt when we come to it.

Hello Clifford,

Since I have more Aldor background, I would rather suggest to write the

you only need multiplication, division and addition or rather partial 
addition

   Union(%, failed) in terms of Axiom (I believe). So the resulting

I would opt of _one_ Unit domain that internally stores the different

You certainly know of "information hiding" why would you let a user of 
the Units domain want to know its internal representation? Would you as 
a _user_ of the Float domain like to know its internal structure. No. 
The only thing that is needed is the API, the properties that this

Hmmm, I still would store internally the units as kg, s, m, etc. If you 
really like auto conversion to the units you are interested in than you 
would have to make the Units domain to carry a state. Something like,

Units(...): ... == add {
   outputUnits: HashTable(String, String) == ["kg", "m", ... ];
   setOutputUnit(length, "cm"): String == ...
   ...
}

(I think String is a bad choice here, but I cannot think of something 
better at the moement.)

Maybe you browse with hyperdoc for DMP. But what I actually meant was, 
that something like a DirectProduct or an Array would do for the 
implementation of the pivot units. Each unit gets a slot and you store 
the corresponding exponent of the unit in that slot. In fact, a good 
implementation of Z^n as a monoid is what you want, maybe 
Vector(Integer) works.

Theoretically the ratio could be an irrational number, but any number

rational. Maybe there is someone who knows of two units that are in 
irrational correspondence. What about a \pi meter?

From: William Sit
To: Cliff Yapp
Subject: Re: Unit package question

Very interesting topic, which I have been following.

I like the idea for a "pivotal unit". What better one to use than the
international system of units (SI)? 

http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/

Different schemes for implementation have been proposed, some even coded. I
don't like the idea of having one domain for each dimension (there are 7 base
units listed in SI) because we would then have to have new domains for derived
dimensions like "force".  Axiom has a way to handle number systems and I think
the unit systems can follow this number system model which has an
IntegerNumberSystem category with four domains: Integer, RomanNumeral,
MachineInteger, and SingleInteger. So we can have one category UnitSystem, with
domains like CGSSystem, MKSSystem, InternationalSystem, etc, where
InternationalSystem would be the default, and the other systems convert to and
from this. In the UnitSystem category, we specify dimensions, beginning with the
seven basic dimensions (length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic
temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity) and expanded to
include other derived dimensions. The UnitSystem category should allow a
parameter S:SetCategory. In principal, units are input/output "decorations"
attached to expressions from any set S. 

The complications of units come from the conversion factors, which are generally
floating point numbers (and dimensionless). This would be ok if we only deal
with numerical quantities. For symbolic quantities, it is the dimensions that
are more important and conversion factors (not to be confused with universal
physical constants) are seldom used, and universal physical constants are often
denoted by a symbol (such as "g" for acceleration due to gravity) without units.
Thus we should leave symbolic computed expressions alone (that is, in the set S,
even though it is actually in some domain of UnitSystem(S), see below). The
verification of dimension on the two sides of a symbolic equation is not a
simple matter since in the applied sciences, one often "balance" dimension with
a constant of proportionality, for which there is no a priori assignment of
dimension in general. However, we can enforce some degree of verification by our
implementation of dimensions (see below). Acutal units are needed once we pass
from symbolic to numerical computation. Thus we should design the UnitSystem
domains to facilitate such passage. We should have a discussion on what
functionalities are to be included in the UnitSystem category. Here are a few
that comes to mind:

unitMass
unitLength
unitTime
unitCurrent
unitTemp
unitAmount
unitLight

All of the above, and below, functions have signatures similar to:

unitMass:S -> %

and

unitMass(s:S) would declare that the expression s has dimension Mass and unit of
Mass for the domain %: UnitSystem(S). I think this is better than the syntax
s::Mass or s::Kg because it avoids the need for many domains (which would be
difficult to maintain).

A representation for any of the domains of unitMass(s:S) would be
 
   Rep:= Record(value:S, dim:Dimension)

where Dimension would be 

  Dimension:=Union("Mass", "Length", ...)

and we can provide queries for any expression in % as to its Dimension. (The
Dimension domain can also be expanded than just this mere text implementation,
if there are functions that are needed).

We can add as many as we like for the derived dimensions:

unitArea
unitVolume
unitForce
unitPressure

etc.

As an (conceptual) example of implementation (forgive me for Axiom syntax
errors, I did not bother to look them up), we can have:

if S has Ring then
  unitArea(s1:%, s2:%):% ==
    if and(s1.dim = "Length", s2.dim = "Length") then 
      [s1.value * s2.value , "Area"]$Rep
    error "Invalid Dimension"

We can have a "pure" declaration:

unitPressure(s:S):% == [s, "Pressure"]$Rep

or a "derived" declaration:

if S has Field then
  unitPressure(f:%, a:%):% ==
    if and(f.dim = "Force", a.dim = "Area") then
      [f/a, "Pressure"]$Rep

We would need to handle outputs of domains of category UnitSystem(S) to make
sure that the units are displayed at the rightmost location, but this is trivial
given the Rep for the domains in this category (see OutputForm for all the
functionality to handle outputs). Notice that all the dimension verifications
can be done by default in UnitSystem category implementations and the actual
domains only need to handle the units for the particular system.

We need a way to include universal constants, the notation of which depends on
the set S.

if S has Field then
  unitAcceleration(dv:%, t:%):% == [dv/t, "Acceleration"]$Rep
  if S has RetractableTo(Symbol) then
    accelerationDueGravity == ['g:Symbol::S, "Acceleration"]$Rep

If S does not have RetractableTo(Symbol), for example S is Float, then we can
use a specific constant such as 9.81 depending on the domain %:UnitSystem
instead of a symbol g.

So far, the above discussion concentrates on the symbolic side. It also
separates conceptually the notions of dimensions vs units. To handle the
numerical side as well as conversion between different unit systems, one can 
have a "lift" (functor) category that performs this (much like the coercions
between different types of polynomial domains when the coefficient domains are
mapped):

   UnitSystemLifting(US:UnitSystem(S), UT:UnitSystem(T))

would take elements of say, US=CGS(S) to UT=CGS(Float), or to UT=MKS(S). The
exports of this category would contain something like:

convertMass(us:US):UT
convertLength(us:US):UT

The unit conversion factors would be included in such packages and the domain S
should have RetractableTo(Float), or whatever (such as coerced to EXPR FLOAT) to
make sense.

Note that this proposed design allows mixed symbolic-numeric domains for S, such
as POLY FLOAT.

These are just some beginning thoughts, which certainly need serious critique
from all.

I think that it is probably better if we speak with one voice instead of asking
Stephen Watt all seperately. I suggest that we draft a letter (maybe in paper)

Furthermore, I think that we should also ask him to "freeze" the Aldor

No, that is not an example, since \pi meter is not a unit. Well, I looked at

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_units

So the following are problematic:

* Bohr radius for lenght

* circular mil and circular inch for area

* various conversion between angles

* most of the atomic units.

So very probably, one should somehow allow for an additional scalar factor of
type Expression Integer...

With pleasure.  I like Martin's idea of a petition - getting some big
names on board would help.  I had assumed it was impossible - some
communication I remembered from long ago had indicated that there were
commercial ambitions for Aldor and that would preclude open sourcing it
- perhaps I misunderstood or the situation has changed.  That would be
very good news indeed.

Well, yes and no - I agree functions might be limited, but there are
other things.  They all have in common the rule that you can only add
dimensions if the dimensions being added are the same.  They all have
the same requirement for display formatting - e.g.:

    kg*m                a
 23 ----,  23a N, 25 K, - Ohms, etc. 
      2                 b
     s

All metric units share the same prefix convention both for full names
and abbreviations (the programmer in me wants to use that, but I
concede it might be better in the Axiom world not to, though I have not
given up yet).  There are rules that work for all units which tell you
what the units would be for operations like integration even if you
don't DO the integration (see Barton Willis's dimensional analysis
package - I'm not sure how formalized those rules are there, but they
do seem useful.)  There could be global settings which might
potentially apply to multiple dimensions  (like, say, don't use derived
dimensions at all - report everything in base dimensions.)  That kind
of thing was why I thought a category might be useful (not fully
understanding the purpose of categories, granted) but if it would make
it hard to multiply dimensions like Mass*Time then it's a bad idea -
the very notion of derived dimensions rests on those operations.

A dimension is an abstract concept of a physical property, whereas a
unit is a description of some specific instance or manifestation of
that property.  For example, Length is a dimension, meter is a unit
describing the dimension Length.  Inch would also be a unit describing
the dimension Length, and because they both describe the same dimension
it is legal to consider things like 2*meters+3*inches.  By the same
token, Mass is a dimension, kg is a unit describing the dimension Mass,
and a slug is also a unit describing the dimension Mass.  So
3*kg+2*slugs has meaning, because the dimension of both terms being
added is the same.  However, 3*kg+2*meters is not legal, because
although both are units the dimensions each of those units are
describing a DIFFERENT dimension.

Also, let's consider the equation for parabolic motion:

 x = x0+v0*t+1/2*a*t^2

We know that x and x0 describe distance (e.g. Length), t describes
Time, v0 describes Velocity, which is a derived dimension defined as
Length divided by Time, and a is an Acceleration is a derived
dimension, defined in terms of another derived dimension (Velocity)
divided by Time, or more fundamentally as Length divided by Time
divided by Time.  

We know all this, but if we were to USE this equation we would input
quantities with units, such as 4*m, 5*hrs, 45*km/s, 9.8*m/s^2, etc. 
But we can use ANY units - equally legal would be 4*yottameters,
5*eons, 45*inches/minute, 10*miles/day^2, etc.  Indeed, it is not
uncommon to have some physical constant or experimental data in
inconvenient units - one of the primary purposes of a units package is
to do all the annoying work for you.  So what you want to do is define
your equation, and define the dimension (NOT the units) of the
variables used.  This prevents x0 being assigned 5*kg, but will allow
any unit which makes physical sense to be used successfully.  A
variable has no concept of what unit it is in most physics equations,
for example, and it isn't supposed to know that.  Perhaps constraining
a variable to a specific unit for display could be implimented, but the
check to make there is that it can be converted to the correct unit and
perform this operation automatically. A second option/setting could be
to accept only a form described in the correct unit, e.g. a*meters for
a variable x with set unit meters.  I can see the latter being useful
only to prevent accidental entry of incorrect data, but it might be
useful for that.  Conceptually I would prefer to allow variables to
only know their dimension by default, and require a specific override
on a per variable basis for other behavior, for two reasons:

1)  This allows a global setting to govern the reported units for all
variables, which I think is useful.  If we want to be able to override
this for specific variables I suppose that would be OK (and maybe even
valuable) but I would much prefer the default to be that all
dimensional quantities be reported in the global unit I specify for
that dimension.

2)  It works against the temptation to allow a user from inputing only
a number to a variable and getting a dimensional quantity back.  One of
the biggest problems in introductory labs (and sometimes well beyond
that!) is people who don't write units down.  Sometimes they don't even
KNOW the units, and are just trying to get by without doing the extra
research and figuring out what they are.  (Textbooks sometimes are
unhelpful in this regard, in my experience, so the habit is to be lazy,
manipulate the numbers, and assume everything worked.)  Implimented the
way I have described, a unit will never get automatically assigned to
anything unless a user specifically sets that up, and to do that they
have to know what unit they want.  E.g. even if we define x as meters
and only meters are allowed for assignment, x := 30 is still rejected
as an error.  x := 30 should never be a legal assignment for any kind
of dimensional variable, regardless of settings.  

I think what people are doing, when they say they want to describe the
variable x as being in meters, is that they want the CAS to know x is a
length and to always display it's value in meters.  That I can agree
with, but I would suggest that if such a feature is implimented it be
in such a way that it does NOT accept x := 30 as being an assignment of
the value of 30*m to the variable x.  This is exceptionally bad
practice and should be disallowed.  I prefer that something like the
following be put in place:

DefineDimension(variable, dimension) : This will associate a given
dimension with a variable.  I would suggest that x::dimension be
configured to do this, as well.

DefineDisplayUnit(variable, unit): This will a) automatically assign x
the dimension Length, and b) instruct Axiom to always convert a
displayed value of x into meters, whatever units it was assigned in or
the global settings tell it to display.  I'm not sure if x::unit is a
good idea or not, but probably should be done for consistency. 
Documentation would have to train people to use the more general
x::dimension if they want global unit settings to be workable.

DefineAssignableUnit(variable, unit):  This will allow assignments to
this variable ONLY if the form being assigned is of the form
variable*unit where unit matches the expected unit of the variable.  It
should not enable an assignment without specifying unit.  Perhaps it
should set the output flag of DefineDisplayUnit as well, or best of all
a flag could control whether it does or not, with the default being
yes.

Does this seem to make sense?

Hopefully the above outlines it - "dimensions are what units describe"
is probably the shortest way to put it I know.  units can share a
dimension, dimensions do not share units.  Dimensional analysis will
report the dimension of an expression, not the units of that expression
(e.g. Time instead of minutes).  It is useful for checking that an
equation gives you the type of dimension you expect - for example if
you define F=ma and dimensional analysis of F gives you Energy, you
know you goofed somewhere (this is less obvious sometimes with units,
particularly in complex cases.)  It also is useful for giving you an
idea of what some quantities in science actually correspond to
physically (also often not as obvious and would be nice.)

Hopefully I'm thinking about all this correctly.  Most people never
need to delve into the nature of units like this - or maybe most other
science types figured this out sooner and more easily than I did,
assuming I've got it right.  Either way, a units package in Axiom will
make it all explicit and documented, if done correctly :-).

Distinguishing the type of the units is essential for knowing what
legal operations for "+" are, just for starters.  This is where my
knowledge of Axiom is too limited to know what the good mappings are -
hopefully that will emerge.  I'm pretty sure there IS a good mapping -
it just needs to be hammered out :-).

This is a nice idea. However, very probably we also need the case of S
being Fraction Integer. So, as I said in my previous post, we may need
to allow for a scalar factor of domain EXPR INT to accomodate
constants which cannot be thrown into S, thus we'd have

  Rep:= Record(value:S, constant: Constant, dim:Dimension)

where Constant would be something like Fraction Polynomial Integer,
with all coefficients equal to one...

You can add (among the ...) "Velocity" (I already used "Acceleration" in the
examples). Also, we can expand Dimension to a fuller domain that can do
arithmetic, and equating Length/Time as Velocity (but notice that there are
cases where the fundamental units are the same, but the physical derived unit
can have multiple meaning: Length*Force can be Work or Moment, so dimensions
should not be confused with their component basic dimensions).

I do not follow the role of constant in the above syntax.
 
The "lift" category I proposed can handle this (by enlarging S when needed).
Meanwhile, S most likely should have RetractableTo(Symbol) and hence we can use
symbolic constants within S. My proposal is to delay all the floating point
computations to the end, in a chosen unit system like CGS, and to do those
computations and displays in CGS(Float).

Moreover, derived dimensions (involving arithmetic of basic dimensions) should
only be allowed to be attached to a value domain S if S has the corresponding
operations.

I don't think the use of mixed unit systems in an expression should be
encouraged: one should not encourage the use of 3 meter + 5 feet (not even 3
meter + 10 kilometer) because the answer must be either in feet or in meter or
something else, but only one unit. So the way to handle mixed unit expression
should be to first convert say 5 feet to meter before addition. I would not
worry about such expressions since that is not "scientific" (Axiom: The
Scientific Computation System).

To repeat, my view of units is that units are "decorations" to be handled in the
domains of UnitCategory(S), using a fixed unit system, and by coercion to
OutputForm;and one should adhere to the standards as given by:

Sounds good to me.  The only fly in the ointment is kilograms for mass,
but this can be handled.  (It might not be an issue if we don't
automate metric prefixes anyway.)

Is that a bad thing, necessarily?  I know there are a fair number of
derived dimensions, but I think it's on the order of 10^1, not 10^2 or
10^3.  That way we can deal with any quirks on a per-dimension basis,
which would be conceptually a good match with the "real world."  Are
there reasons it's a bad idea to define large numbers of domains in
Axiom?

I like this as a user option, but I'm wary of it as a fundamental
structuring mechanism - what about the case where a user finds it
convenient to adjust dimension to a custom default, say wanting Length
to be displayed as nanometers by default instead of meters, but leave
most SI units in place?  (I do understand and agree with the appeal of
this as a way to group definitions of units in terms of SI units - it
does organize that well.)  Where do we put definitions for units not an
official part of SI or one of the other systems?  What if (for whatever
reason) someone wants to mix and match CGS and MKS over the various
dimensions - what mechanism do we use?  I don't think we want to
restrict that behavior - it might be unusual but can't really be called
bad practice, since having whatever units happen to be intuitive
available is perfectly legit, especially when the tools exist (or will
exist ;-) to automatically standardize all units for publication :-).

Hmm.  So instead of domains, we specify the existance of dimensions in
the category definition, and then create domains based around standard
measurement systems which must provide unit definitions for all defined
domains in their category?

Yes, I hadn't gotten to physical constants yet - I figured Units should
be in place first :-).

Hmm.  Did you have an example in mind?  Sometimes that helps.  

Are you referring to the problem that some combinations of units that
will occurr will not map to a derived dimension?  We must allow for
expressions which are composed of the product of base and derived
dimensions - that's inevitable.  Does that pose a problem?

If you're looking to determine dimensional equality, the best way I
know is to reduce everything to the seven base dimensions and simplify.
 That might be a bit more CPU intensive than taking shortcuts in the
case of complex expressions, but it is the most general way I know of
and has the best chance of succeeding in general.

I guess I'm not understanding the difficulty of maintaining domains -
unless there would be problems setting it up, wouldn't it be a one time
effort to create the domains and then occasional additions and unit
definition updates?

This works for things contained in systems, but what about

I like a lot of these ideas, I guess I'm just confused by your
adversion to domains - or rather, I don't fully understand the
difficulties associated with them.  What do we gain by defining
dimensions in the Category, instead of doing the dimensions as domains
and defining the unit systems in terms of specific unit choices for 
available dimensions?

Just curious - lord knows I'm not informed enough to critique :-).

That's a good point, but the distinction is most definitely based on
circumstance.  What would we do if someone assigns or enters a
non-dimensionally-unique unit?  Or one falls out of a calculation?  How
do we do dimensional analysis?  (For that matter, how would that be
handled in the "real world" - are Work and Moment in some sense the
same thing? If not, how can the difference be expressed?)

Right.  I don't understand the difficulty here - the only place mixed
unit systems would be likely to occur is in an input, and the first
thing to do will be to convert them to standard units.  We want people
to be able to enter 3 meter + 5 feed and get x meters out - that's one
of the things a unit package is good for!

Do you mean worry about preserving them interally or as output?  If so,
I agree.  As input, they should be legal if dimensionally legal and
converted internally to useful form.

Absolutely agree.  In fact, we should incorporate that document and/or
other relevant documentation into our eventual coding of the output
logic for units, IMO.

Yes Axiom can handle lots of domains, but that does not mean we HAVE to use one
domain for every physical quantity. See the SI pages for all the quantities.
Also separating the physical quantities into its own domain will cause a lot of
unnecessary coercions and since derived dimensions are obtained with arithmetic
operations, a domain like Force may not support that.

That is no problem at all. A user can create his/her own unit system domain by
modifying the implemented code for SI or CGS, or whatever. The user unit system
can mix units if that is preferred. The only restriction is that in symbolic
computation, that is, in equations involving physical quantity, the actual unit
should NOT be part of the equation, and if it is dimensionally balanced (all
additive terms have the same physical dimension -- but this is not sufficient,
you should not add Work to Moment), then the units can be handled in the unit
domains by modifying the coercions to OutputForm. For example, if "us"
represents a value s with dimension "Force", and one wants to output "Force" in
lb cm/hr^2, then one can have (syntax of Axiom need not be correct):

   coerce(us:MyUnitSystemDomain)==
     ...
     (dimension(us) case "Force") => 
        factor := ...
        hconcat(value(us)*factor::OutputForm, "lb cm/hr^2"::OutputForm)
     ...

where factor is to be computed depending on the (input) units for mass, length
and time in this domain (which NEED NOT be lb, cm, hr respectively). It can also
be handled by the "lift" packages that provides similar coercions. In other
words, units for each physical quantity does not have to be (but CAN be) derived
from the units of the basic dimensions. Let the coerce function handle all the
conversions.

Yes. A unit system should be coherent (even though this proposed set up will
allow unconventional systems) and Axiom should provide the common ones like CGS,
MKS, FPS (foot-lb-sec). Users can then modify one closest to their liking and
customize it. Other users can then write other domains in categorical terms if
dimensions are involved by referring to UnitSystem category.

Physical constants are an integral part. Pi is a good example that appears in
many physical formulae.

How about Weight = Mass * AccelerationDueGravity and
Circumference = Pi * Radius?

Both AccelerationDueGravity and Pi are considered constants (which is correct
only when each is converted to a numerical value after chosing a unit system):
but the first has a dimension of "Acceleration" and the second is dimensionless
(Dimension domain should include "None" in the Union("Mass", etc)).

Another example is specific heat c, defined by the equation: Q = c m dT, giving
c a dimension of energy/(mass * temp). The only way to find the dimension of
such a quantity in general is by "solving" (dimension analysis) but that only
provides the answer in terms of basic dimensions.

There is no one-to-one conversion from rational expressions of basic dimensions
to physical quantities. When possible, the physical name of the dimension should
be retained (so moment cannot be confused with work; this also remind me that we
should separate scalar quantites from vector quantities).

The reason against separate domains for each physical quantity (dimension in
this sense) is not just because there are lots of them, but because it would be
difficult to spell out the interrelationships and to create new ones. Yes,
everything is a one time effort, except when it comes to being used.

I suppose if there is no consensus, then we would have to implement with
different designs. Axiom can support that with no problem.

I don't know the difficulties about many domains either, since I have not tried
to implement them. I only have a hunch. It may turn out that having many domains
(one for each dimensional quantity) is easier (to use and to implement). Neither
do I have a clear picture of what I proposed, but at this point, I like it
better (until convinced otherwise). I like it because, as you asked, one can
design one's own unit system once, and then doesn't have to worry about it. I
also like it because it separates the symbolic expression from the units. The
functions of the form unitXXX can be used in assignment statements that carry
out a sequence of computations, verifying the dimensions and they stay in the
same domain (no need to load tons of domains and perform domain-to-domain
conversions (even if that is possible and meaningful). An example of such a
sequence of computation can be (assuming the domain S is FRAC POLY INT and we
use FPS(S) and we have implemented the arithmetic operations in FPS(S), as
inherited from S; the output units are put in brackets to separate them from the
expressions):

ux0:=unitLength('x0)

    x0 [ft]

uv0:=unitVelocity('v0)

    v0 [ft/s]

ut:=unitTime('t)

    t [s]

ua:=unitAcceleration('a)

    a [ft/s^2]


us:=ux0 + uv0*ut + ua * ut^2/2

    x0 + v0*t + a*t^2/2 [ft]

us::MYUnitSystem(S)

    (x0 + v0*t + a*t^2/2)*factor [yd/hr^2]

where factor is a number or an undefined symbolic convertion factor. One can
also input values in other system than the one used:

ux0:=unitLength(50)$MYUnitSystem(S)::FPS(S)

    150 [ft]

would take the input 50 [yd] (yd being the unit of length in MYUNitSystem(S))
and convert it to FPS(S). It is much easier to remember the name of a unit
system than to remember all the units of various dimensional quantities. Using
the Rep proposed in the previous message:

   Rep:=[value:S, dim:Dimension]

the last instruction first creates

   [50, "Length"] in MYUNitSystem(S)

and then converts it to 

   [150, "Length"] in FPS(S).

The conversion factor only arises when we change unit systems. If the conversion
factor is not coercible to S, we can leave it symbolic and undefined, like:

   [50 yd2ft, "Length"] in FPS(S)

and then one can evaluate:

subst(value(ux0), yd2ft, 3.0)

or better:

ux0::FPS(Float) 

   150.0 [ft]

will do the conversion without the user knowing how it is done.

The two are different. Moment (in physics) is a measure of tendency to produce
motion especially about a point or axis and is computed by the product of
quantity (as a force) and the distance to a particular axis or point. Work is
the transference of energy that is produced by the motion of the point of
application of a force and is measured by multiplying the force and the
displacement of its point of application in the line of action. (Both taken from
Merriam-Webster On-line).

Yes, we CAN allow input like 3 meter + 5 feet, but the question is, how is the
system going to tell whether the user wants meter or feet in the answer? In my
scenario, the user would be forced to do something like

(unitLength(3)$MKS(S) + unitLength(5)$FPS(S))::MKS(S)

    3 + 5*ft2m [meter]

which may not be that bad, because it forces the user to think carefully and
spell out explicitly the units used. (This certainly would have prevented the
crash on Mars). 
In the domain-preferred scenario, this would be:

   (3 meter + 5 feet)::meter

The disadvantage of the former is it is long-winded, but the user does not have
to know the actual units in the systems and there is no new syntax to be
learned. The disadvantage of the latter is that the user needs to know the
units, and the units takes up name space (meter and feet would have to be
reserved words) and either a new syntax has to be constructed or the domains
"meter", etc needs to know about arithmetic. It is certainly more intuitive, for
simple units at least (can anyone name the unit for viscosity or thermal
diffusivity offhand?) Given the number of unit systems and the number of
physical quantities, I would opt for not having to know them except the system
names, or just MYUnitSystem.

Correction: the unit of Force should be slug cm /hr^2 in the above example. lb

That, at least, I would prefer to avoid.  If the user sets SI or CGS, I
think we would prefer to avoid requiring them to program spad code to

We can make it stronger by requiring all additive terms to have the
same dimension, and not allow derived dimensions with the same units to
be automatically merged.  (Really, if they could be merged all we would
need to do is define a few more aliases for the original dimension, as
opposed to making a separate one. If we make Work and Moment separate
derived dimensions, they won't merge at the symbolic level.  However,
we will have to make a decision as to the mapping of a unit back to a
variable with a dimension matching the unit's MKS base unit definition
- do we assume if someone is assigning a variable with dimension Work a
value with units compatible with Work, it is a Work quantity and not a
Moment quantity?  The same problem holds for dimensional analysis - we
should report something.  Do we report Work, Moment, or both?  If
someone enters a purely unit based expression and wants dimensional
analysis of it, what do we do?  Erroring out with something like
"non-unique dimensional mapping - please specify dimension type for
<error generating unit> - {Work, Moment}" would probably be the most
correct way.  Maybe we could have a setting which was either strict
(above behavior) or fuzzy (assumes in a case where there are multiple
possibilities the user knew what they were doing, in order to avoid
endless aggrevation when working on basic problems?  If a scientist
knows Moment is not part of his system, he can use fuzzy matching for
casual work and get strict about it for the final draft :-). And it
would also be good to document the physical reasons behind such design
decisions, so people who aren't physics gurus could figure out why the
CAS is grumbling at them ;-)

Well, as long as we put an intuitive front end on everything for the
end user, I'm OK.  A bit of context - for the Maxima units package I
have a function setunits() which takes as an argument a list of
variables, and sets those to be the default output units for each
dimension.  It returns an error if there is more than one unit
corresponding to a given dimension.  I would prefer to be able to do
this in Axiom, as well.  Here's one scenario: I start up Axiom and have
the default system load up in SI units.  I look at my data, and realize
I'm working on a scale of nanometers.  SI is ideal for most everything
I'm going to be doing, but I want Length output to be in nm so I don't
have to visually sort through lots of powers of ten.  In Maxima, I
could simply say setunits(nm) and from that point on, until I told it
differently, all my lengths would be converted and rendered in output
as nanometers.  I would like similar ease of use in Axiom, if it is
compatible with how Axiom works - I'd rather not have to open up the
text editor, whip out a new MyUnits domain, and define things
accordingly - I'd rather that all be hidden.

That's the part that worries me a little - as a user I want to just say
"use MKS" and then "but render Mass in slugs" without ever worrying
about domains, convert functions, or any details I don't have to.  At
next axiom startup my "render Mass in slugs" preference is lost, which
is find with me - it was a purely temporary condition.

Depending on how sophisticated the user is, yes.

Pi (3.14... right) is a unitless number, and so (hopefully) isn't a
worry from a units standpoint?  Am I missing something?

Hmm, perhaps I should clarify - when I say physical constants I'm
thinking things like speed of light, Plank's constant, mass of an
electron, etc - i.e. things with units.  Am I using incorrect
terminology?

Right, then you do pattern matching to see if those basic dimensions
map into any of the derived dimensions.  (Or at least, that's what I
did in Maxima.  Maybe that's not workable here - I'll have to think
about it a bit.)

It is easy to create functions to reset the units in any domain of UnitSystem
category. We just have to do this by providing functions like:

setUnitLength(nm)  -- assuming we use SI abbreviations.

However, for the package to provide such generality would require not only
updating an internal table (it will require one anyway, of all the units
corresponding to physical quantities (dimensions)) but also that the output
coercions figure out the factors before output. This does complicate the output
coercions because there can be many cases to deal with even if we restrict such
user settings to the seven basic dimensions. If a normal range of powers of 10
is from -30 to 30 (which includes nanoscale to astronomical scales, and enlarge
the range if you like), there would be about 20 cases to check for each basic
dimension (allowing one new prefix for every third value of the exponent). On
the other hand, a user custom unit system need only modify simple code for the
specific units. Generalities quickly expands the cases exponentially.

The set functions will also have to do error checking (that is, verify that nm
is indeed a unit of length, or at least among the units it knows). Again, this
would complicate the implementation of the domains for UnitSystem category.
Would you allow, for example, in SI(S), setUnitLength(ft)? (I would vote a
definite No).

Remember, a user can do such unit conversion by coercion if Axiom thinks that
nanoscale is a common unit system and provides one. We can also provide one for
astronomical units. The idea is to allow gradual growth to satisfy user needs,
but the first implementations do not have to be all-encompassing. The design has
to be.

All I am saying is that even if an equation is dimensionally correct, it could
still be wrong (in terms of physics) because of this non-unique mapping. We
certainly cannot just use dimensional analysis (reducing to basic dimensions) to
discover that Work = Moment is wrong.

In my scheme, you do not assign a variable to its unit explicitly. You assign a
dimension to the value (which has no unit attached explicitly, and only
implicitly based on the domain the result of unitXXX function). This frees the
symbolic computation of units, the way it is usually done in science.

I don't understand this question. There is NO unique way to decompose ANY
rational expression in basic dimensions and return it as a result of (rational
expression) in physical derived dimensions. Dimensional analysis is a one-way
method: reduce derived dimensions into its basic dimensions and match the
exponents for each basic dimension.

Even a so-called "dimensionless" quantity can sometimes have "dimension":

  phase angle: unit radian, dimension m.m^(-1)
  solid angle: unit steradian, dimension m^2. m^(-2)

See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html

There is no hope to list all possibilities.  Another example taken from that
page:

  absorbed dose (specific energy imparted), unit gray, dimension m^2.s^(-2). 

The dimension is actually meaningless. Expressed in terms of derived dimensions, 
1 gray is 1 J/kg (makes perfect sense as energy/mass). But one can also say the
dimension is that of velocity^2 in other context.

Yes, as explained earlier, we CAN provide such functionality. I don't know how
you implemented that in Maxima, but I think it would be cumbersome if
restrictions are not set.

I really don't think a scientific worker would use slugs with MKS. I would
emphatically discourage you from doing that! Making it very easy for a user to
"violate" a system of units is asking for trouble. Making it more difficult at
least ensures the user knows or thinks about what (s)he is doing. I don't
implement generality for generality's sake. Life is too short.

Don't mix unit systems! Convert first before you start the computations, and
convert back if you really have to.

Let's see. A circle spans 2 pi radians at its center. So 2 pi radians = 360
degrees.
So pi has unit degree/radian (even though that is dimensionless) when it is
viewed as a unit conversion factor between radians and degrees.

One may do a certain amount of guessing or pattern matching, but that is limited
by one's current knowledge (limited, at best). The example I gave earlier,
m^2.s^(-2), would you even have thought of it as absorbed dose? (I certainly
didn't before writing this email). Given the vastness of scientific research,
you need a subject matter expert to increase the chance of meaningful matching.
The user is often the subject matter expert. Let him or her deal with it.

One thing to keep in mind is that Axiom defines things from
the category level. Perhaps we need to work out the category

we develop the specific domains. I'm picturing a diagram

CY,

This is a convention (not universally followed). The definition of
a domain has a signature, a list of functions it exports and the
implementation of those functions.

Axiom's syntax for a macro is 

  name ==> definition

so you'll see things like:

foo(R: Ring): Exports == Implementation

  Exports ==> ...
  Implementation ==> ...

The left and right sides of the '==' are given in macro definitions.
You could have easily said:

foo(R: Ring): Left == Right

  Left ==> ...
  Right ==> ...

I agree that we need to define the syntax with a real example.
Perhaps if we develop the Dimension package in public we can
use it as an example of developing a domain and a give complete,
step-by-step explanation in the pamphlet. We could include it as
a chapter in the Programmer's Guide in the axiom--book--1 tree.

Actually, we can even do better, without the user doing a setUnitLength(nm), if
the only reason to use nm instead of m is to get rid of annoying powers of 10.
For numerical output (the problem does not arise for symbolic output), the
output coerce routine can sense the magnitude of the value in the unit and shift
the decimal place appropriately and adjusting using a suitable prefix. So one
stays in SI but the output gets rid of the powers of 10.

So you're saying that dimension(23*J) should return an error, because
without context it's not clear what physical dimension is being
described?  I agree that if the knowledge exists in the definitions it
should be carried along, but without context, as in the above example,
what should be done?

I propose a convention - it is likely that any use Axiom's unit package
will see will be from the physics community, since that is the most
math heavy of the basic physical sciences.  I propose we create a
variable that can be set to select pre-defined behaviors for cases
where a physical unit corresponds to more than one dimension.  For the
PHYSICS convention, I suggest that the above command return a dimension
of Energy, with perhaps a cautionary that this mapping is not unique in
general.  This would correspond to what I would expect.  (Also, are
Energy and Work different physical dimensions?)  A mode STRICT might be
created where the above returns a description in terms of the seven
base dimensions, which will be correct without pinning the definition
specifically to one derived dimension.  What should be the default I
don't know.

I think there could be again modes of operation - in this case fuzzy
(which goes ahead and assumes if MKS units are the same the derived
quantities can safely be considered the same) and strict, which will
raise flags and/or provide correct but less useful answers.  I
guarantee that making Axiom too strict in a correctness sense without
providing a way to get things done will lose it much of its audience in
the unit game, since physicists as a rule are not overly concerned with
mathematical rigor. (Compared to mathematicians, anyway ;-)  I think
allowing both strict mode and fuzzy mode is a good idea, which allows
for both full correctness if needed and a more practical working
environment if desired.  I invite comment on this, since I might have
just stomped Axiom philosophy into the carpet :-/.  At a fair number of
usage levels, people might not even know what Moment IS, much less
whether the dimension of the quantity found in the book is Work or not.
(The book itself might make an unstated assumption, which a student
would have no way to be aware of but an expert in the field would know.
 The student would want to make such assumptions initially, and only if
problems arose go back and check hidden assumptions.  (At least, that's
my guess ;-)

OK.  It seems like as long as actual unit transformations are
neglected, things are fairly easy to work with, so I don't think a
design decision change would pose too great a difficulty at the
symbolic level.

Fair enough :-).

Hmm.  Well, the situations in which the labels are used are different,
but I'm not sure what is being described isn't the same thing on a
dimensional level.  But, I'll go ahead on it, since it could be Energy
and Work don't always interchange either...

Don't we WANT the units and dimensions to take namespace, at least at
user toplevel?  If the UNITS package were active, we certainly don't
want people using unit names for anything ELSE - it would cause waaay
too much confusion.  I would have viewed it as a design goal that (3
meter + 5 feet)::meter work as expected.

I guess I would prefer to be able to either "use" the SI system, and
allow local overrides through simple syntax, or "set" the SI system,
and insist on everything being rendered using it.

Correct - the Maxima active unit rulesets got quite large.  However,
that is also when they are most useful, at least too me.  I want the
computer doing all my grunt work for me, which includes spotting all
the obscure unit definitions and taking care of them.  Fundamentally,
the set of all units is large, and that's what I want Axiom able to
manage.  Whether or not this will require such exponential data sets is
not totally clear yet, but would not surprise me.

Correct.  Maxima's checks first that it is a unit and then that that
unit is a length.

I would vote yes, because I can't predict what I'll want to do with my
unit environment.

Agreed.  I'm not shooting for immediately comprehensive, but for the
ability to be comprehensive in the future.  I can't imagine all the
ways and situations units can be applied, so I don't want to restrict
the user runtime environments that can be set up and customized.

But it should be doable, readily, IMHO.  That's what computers are for
- to handle the grunt work associated with such decisions.

No.  However, the ultimate burden in such cases will rest with the
scientist in question, and it may be that the dimensional correctness
of the equation is useful information to him/her.  Hence my suggestion
for two modes on dealing with such things.

Agreed.  My question is how dimension(<expr>) should react when <expr>
is not a set of variables, but an expression with units  (E.g. 10 J).

Right, if you are looking at the dimensional equality of two sides of
an expression.  There is also the case where you want to know what
quantity/dimension an expression is.

I'm not sure what the useful thing to do there is.

Right.  So conventions must be defined, preferable default ones as well

Yes, I guess it is cumbersome to implement, but I was willing to pay

That was just an example.  nanometers instead of meters, or light years
instead of meters, would be more realistic examples.

But that's just it - part of the reason for implementing a Unit system
in a CAS in the first place is to get it to do all the converting and
other annoyingly boring and error prone tasks for you - both for input
and output.

I'm confused - when does it hurt to trivially reduce or ignore this?

That makes no sense to me at all - when is it useful to consider a
dimensionless quantity to have dimension?  Isn't that a logical
contradiction?  F AND ~F -> F

OK, but I still think a) we can prepare useful "domains" such as
defaults for physics, and b) if such work is done by subject matter
experts we should be able to incorporate it since it would constitute a
useful tool for work in the subject in question.

Fascinating discussion!

Are nanometer, etc. considered part of SI then?  Nifty idea, and one
worth following up on, but I would still like to peg things at nm, for
the following reason/scenario:  Let's say I know that my calculations
and data SHOULD be coming out in the nm range.  I set my unit for
length to be nm, proceed, and mostly see small numbers of nm.  All well
and good, until suddenly I have a huge or very small number appearing. 
Red flag!  Not close to 1 nm.  With autoscaling, the number would have
stayed near one and the unit would have changed.  Sometimes useful, I
agree, but I can see arguments for both sides here.

Subject: [polymake] (nouveau) 

This is a trivial wrapper for the wonderful polymake package from
Berlin, http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/polymake/ .  Note that this is
rather a proof of concept, so if you think you've got a better design
idea, go ahead and comment below.  So far, only little of the polymake
functionality is covered, but it's mostly very easy to extend.

Usage

  You can find some simple examples in [SandBox polymake]. There, you
  can also try it out online!

Design

  I've decided to communicate with polymake for a start via file I/O,
  but would be easy to change this if necessary. Every polymake object
  created is stored with a "canonical" name: For example, if you ask
  for a cube of dimension 4, axiom will issue the shell command 'cube
  cube4.poly 4'. Then, when you ask for a property of this cube, for
  example, the hvector, then the shell command 'polymake cube4.poly
  H_VECTOR > tmp.poly' is issued. Finally axiom reads the contents of
  'tmp.poly' and converts it to the appropriate type. Thus, the only
  thing that really has to be programmed is a conversion routine for
  every polymake type. Some of these are trivial, like the Boolean,
  vector or matrix types, some others need more thought.


  Currently there are only two domains: 'Polytope' and
  'SimplicialComplex'. If you want a particular polymake property or
  construction supported, or want to have a new domain like 'Graph',
  go ahead and change the contents of this file. If you need help, you
  can always ask me.

Subject: re: aldor patches

Peter,

I would like to install your aldor patches on the MathAction
Website. My idea is to be able to include Aldor source files
on MathAtion something like this

  \begin{aldor}
  Aldor code
  \end{aldor}

SPAD code can already be compile on MathAction like this:

  \begin{axiom}
  ABBREV ...
  SPAD code
  \end{axiom}

I want to be able to call both SPAD and Aldor modules from Axiom
commands like this:

  \begin{axiom}
  Call to Aldor routines etc.
  \end{axiom}

To that end, I have updated the Axiom sources to tla archive
Patch-44 and also applied the patches to INTERP that you sent
to Tim earlier. As describedf in your email, I extracted
src_aldor.tgz to the axiom/src directory and then I ran 'make'.
The log file from the make is attached. It also shows the
versions of javac and aldor installed on the MathAction
(axiom-developer) server.

In the log file you will note that the make failes starting
at this point:

...
/home/page/repository/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/Make.rules:31:
/home/page/reposit
ory/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/Make.functions: No such file or directory
/home/page/repository/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/Make.rules:34:
/home/page/reposit
ory/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/Make.axiom: No such file or directory
/home/page/repository/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/Make.rules:35:
/home/page/reposit
ory/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/Make.aldor: No such file or directory
/home/page/repository/axiom--main--1/src/aldor/types.mk:41:
/home/page/repositor
y/axiom--main--1/int/aldor/all_spad_types.mk: No such file or directory

...

----------

Perhaps this failure has to do with the problems you mentioned
below. I have tried to run document manually on all of the
*.pamphlet files but I still find some missing. Perhaps there are
other problems?

I would be glad to help debug this some more and I look forward to
receiving an updated version of your files.

Thanks.

Yes, but I have no idea how to use sockets from an axiom domain. Do you? If so,
go ahead and show me a simple example. I can then adapt the domain.

Yes, I hope so too.

Hm, on my machine here it works just fine... Except that I need to parametrize
the domain, to allow for polytopes with vertices being floats or rational
numbers.

I grepped my polymake directory for "Illegal instruction" but got no
match. Where does this come from?

Subject: Axiom Design Question / Polymake feedback

Dear all,

I got already nice feedback from Michael Joswig, one of the heads of
polymake. He said he liked the idea, but they are probably going for
Singular. A very clever choice indeed -- I didn't think of that one. It
probably would make sense to look at Singulars functionality and see how it
compares with axioms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from that I have the following design problem:

I have a domain which contains polytopes. 

)abbrev domain POLYTOPE Polytope
Polytope(): Exports == Implementation where
    Exports == with

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--               polytope constructions                                      --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      cube: Integer -> %

      randSphere: (Integer, Integer) -> %

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--               polytope properties                                         --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      hvector: % -> List Integer

      vertices: % -> Matrix ???

Now the problem is as follows: the type of the elements of the matrix depends
on the polytope. For some polytopes, they are Integers, for others rationals or
floats, or both.

Now one solution is simply to parametrize the domain:

)abbrev domain POLYTOPE Polytope
Polytope(R: Ring): Exports == Implementation where
    Exports == with

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--               polytope constructions                                      --
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      cube: Integer -> %

      if R is Float then randSphere: (Integer, Integer) -> %

      vertices: % -> Matrix R

However, I'm not convinced that this is the best solution. One reason being,
that I don't really want that the user has to specify the type of his polytope
all the time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here is the second idea:

have a package 

)abbrev domain POLYCON PolytopeConstructions
PolytopeConstructions(): Exports == Implementation where
    Exports == with

      cube: Integer -> Polytope Integer

      randSphere: (Integer, Integer) -> Polytope Float

and a parametrized domain as above. I'm not sure whether this is sensible,
either

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third idea:

Make all vertices have coordinates of type Fraction Integer. If they happen to
be integers, they can be converted afterwards anyway. It is highly unlikely
that there will be anything around that does not have rational vertices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what do you think?

Use of sockets requires compilation of Axiom with the newest
version of GCL (2.6.7). At the present time the lisp functions
for access to sockets is not exposed to the user but doing this
would not be difficult. But in short it can not be done yet
without some lisp programming. I am planning to re-build Axiom
very soon with gcl-2.6.7 and Peter Broadbery's work on Aldor.
When that is done that I will be able to give you an example
of sockets in Axiom.

I don't understand what you mean by "parameterize the domain". This
does not involve Axiom as such although it is called by one of your
"spad wrappers". This is just a direct call to one of the standard
polymake constructors (ref: the polymake user guide):

rand_sphere <file> <dimension> <n> [ -precision <digits> ] [ -seed <s> ]

Produce a d-dimensional polytope with n random vertices on the unit
sphere. Floating-point coordinates are used. Uniform distribution.
The default precision is set to 6 digits.

-------

On your computer if you type:

rand_sphere randsp.poly 2 3

what are the contents of the randsp.poly file?

This is an error message from the linux operating system indicating
that the program tried to execute an illegal machine instruction (i.e.
an instruction that was not allowed by the CPU in the particular state
that it was in). This one of several different kinds of program aborts
and is usually caused by a programming error or perhaps a compiler
error.
This problem might be solved if we could just re-compile the programs
from source code.

The polymake domain currently has

     vertices: % -> Matrix Integer

This cannot work, since the vertices are not always integers. See my other
post.

might it be that you got the wrong RPM?

Yes. but the developers themselves say that this is at least very time
consuming, if you don't have enough memory on your machine. Well, I guess you
have...

Ideally, I think you might want to return something like:

vertices: % -> Matrix Union (Integer, Float, Fraction Integer)

but unfortunately Axiom does not understand that domain
Union (Integer, Float, Fraction Integer) is actually a RING so
you are not allowed to call it a Matrix.

Instead you might use, for example:

vertices: % -> List List Union (Integer, Float, Fraction Integer)

or maybe

vertices: % -> TwoDimensionalArray Union (Integer, Float, Fraction
Integer)

but note that for some reason

(11) -> x: TwoDimensionalArray Union (Integer, Float, Fraction Integer)
:=new(2,2,0)

   (1)  [0,0,0,0]
          Type: TwoDimensionalArray Union(Integer,Float,Fraction
Integer)

does not print properly (as an rectangular array).

I think there are two possible bug reports here:

1) Union ( list of alternatives that are coercible to some ring )
   should be a RING

2) display of TwoDimensionalArray of type Union(...) is not properly
   formatted

Do you agree?

Yes, I understand. But this is a separate problem. The problem
that I mention below is a program abort in a polymake constructor.

On the axiom-developer server the result is just "Illegal instruction".

I don't think so. The developers only provide one rpm file for linux

We are talking about Axiom here, remember. It is nothing for us if the
build of Axiom talks all day long! So what if building polymake takes
a couple of hours?

Anyway as far as I can tell, there are some errors in the polymake
source code. I would be glad to discuss this with the developers.

No! In your case, where the arguments of the union form an ascending chain of
rings, that would be true. In general, you cannot do arithmetic with operands
from different rings. Think about Union(INT, MATRIX INT).

The best one can do in Martin's case would be, as you noted,

   Union(MATRIX INT, MATRIX FRAC INT, MATRIX FLOAT)

To use List List Union(INT, FRAC INT, FLOAT) would require one to do case
statements in every entry of the matrix and also lose the ring properties of
matrices.

No.

For example:

U := Union(MPOLY([x,y],INT), PF 5); x: U := 2*x; y: U := 3;

x+y does not make much sense. And asking the system to see whether there is a
common supertype is asking for quite a lot and is probably error prone.

These packages were compiled under SuSE 9.0. They should fit the recent
versions of other Linux distributions too.

In older distributions the RPM installation might fail complaining about
unresolved dependences on GLIBC or something similar. In this unfortunate case
you will have to take the source RPM and recompile it: rpm --rebuild
polymake-*.src.rpm or rpmbuild --rebuild polymake-*.src.rpm .

Packages are compiled for various CPU models. The i586 variant is a generic
Pentium architecture used in SuSE by default, i586 is optimized for Pentium 4,
and athlon for AMD Athlon XP. Be sure to pick the package most suitable to your
hardware.

Yes, for different *hardware* but not different versions of linux.

I installed the end user package for the Intel 686 machine:

[page@axiom-developer page]$ ls -l -d poly*.rpm

But this is a shared *virtual* server so although this is a i686 machine
maybe we do not get to use the whole i686 instruction set?

Did you install the i586 version?

I will download and install the i586 version and see if that corrects
the problem.

It occurs to me to ask if you are already familiar with the following
Axiom commands:

vp1:=draw(sin(x), x=%pi/10..%pi)
g1:=getGraph(vp1,1)
pointLists(g1)
...
g2:=makeGraphImage(lineSegments, lineColors, pointColors, lineSize)
pointLists(g2)

See for example

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomGraphics

Perhaps uidraw is producing output similar to this?

I know these commands and I actually had working code using this

Let's be clear. You are requesting a reverse dimensional analysis in essence.
Given a rational expression in the dimensions (basic or derived), you want to
give as meaningful as possible an interpretation (or list of interpretations)
that is relevant to the expert user. 

>From you statement:

   dimension(23*J)

you are assuming that J is a reserved variable in Axiom, or at least
recognizable by the system just like %pi.  I think using up name space with
short names like "J" for Joule, etc is going to be very problematic with the
interpreter. My proposal puts these only as output strings, and does not allow
their direct manipulations as variables. To input 23 J, one would have to do:

   x := unitEnergy(23)$SI(INT)

assuming Joule = Newton-meter is the default energy unit in SI. Under this
setting, one can create a function

   dimension: % -> Dimension

where for example, dimension(x) would return 
  
      "Energy"

(the unit may or may not be given, depending on design; and I think if unit is
what is intended, then we should have:

   unit: % -> OutputForm

and 

   unit(x)

       "J"

or in basic units:

       "N-m"

(adopting notation from SI).  Since I view units I/O as only decorations, they
are all strings and not to be manipulated by arithmetic (but string operations
are allowed of course). All this works in the current proposed scheme.

Now the reverse dimension analysis (RDA) is a totally different problem. The
input to RDA is the outputform of a physical quantity (symbolic or numeric),
perhaps inputted as a string (as I discussed, I object strongly to using up user
namespace). Assuming the string uses SI convention, we can write a parser based
on the grammar defined, first to reduce every additive term to basic units in
the seven basic dimensions, verify that they are all the same, then
re-interpreting the resulting dimension expression in terms of plausible
physical quantities depending on the subject matter expertise. This requires a
substantial amount of math: basically, assuming you have the taxonomy for units
in the expert area, you have to solve a dimension analysis problem, which is a
(fairly large size) linear diophantine problem. A solution is of course
guaranteed since the dimensions of the given terms in the input expression are
solutions, but more likely, you are going to have many solutions (for example,
energy can be produced various ways: potential and kinetic, rotational, work,
Einstein's mass-energy exchange, etc). A decision criterion to choose the
"simplest", perhaps by the minimum total sum of the exponents of all the
basic/derived dimensions allowed, would then present the user with the result or
set of results.

I think the usefulness of such a RDA is minimal. A user typically knows what
that is when he forms the expression. Perhaps letting the system check the
consistency of terms in dimension is the only useful feedback, but that does not
require RDA.

Having a system setting to choose a particular unit system as default is
certainly desirable and possible. Axiom has extensive )set commands. The
convenience gained after this )set command

   )set unit SI

will be that the following commands do not require a package call:

   unitMass, etc

   unit

Being "fuzzy" is certainly against the philosophy of Axiom, but I suppose as
long as it is clearly pointed out, there is no reason not to allow it. Martin
has a "guessing" program for sequences, and it is very useful. So go ahead. I
agree that Axiom suffered commercial failure for its inflexibility.

No, energy is energy and Work is energy, so they are interchangeble. (For
example, work against friction produces heat).

Well, in my proposal, units names are implicit by using declarative functions
(like unitMass()) in a particular domain of the UnitSystem category. I have
already argued against the use of reserved variables for units. People should be
allowed to use J, nm, etc as their own variables. All system variables (except
domain abbreviations and names) have to be preceded by a % sign, as in %pi. You
have to teach the interpreter to recognize these special names.

SI provides standardized prefixes and abbrevations in the range 10^(-24) to
10^(24), one for every three unit change in the exponent, which are applicable
to ANY physical quantity (with the exception of kilogram, see SI pages, to avoid
double prefixes). More interestingly, SI also has prefixes and abbreviations for
the computer industry: kilibit (1024 bits) vs kilobit (1000 bits). Axiom
implementation definitely should adhere to SI standards and implement all their
standardized and accepted units.

Since SI provides prefixes only for every thousand-fold change, if all
computations you expect are in the scale of 1 nm, you would probably spot these
errors in hundreds of nm. But anyway, every scientist should be aware of units
attached to quantities, especially in graphs! I think autoscaling is good enough
(Note, all digital meters autoscales! Scientists are used to that.)

I think whoever implements this should first program for the correct framework,
and provide basic unit systems based on SI. Then as usage expands, add more unit
system domains. Then if that is not enough, add more friendly user settings. I
am fairly convinced that the framework proposed earlier is able to handle and
facilitate this plan of development. I would like to hear more critique from
others.

Thanks for this interesting discussion.

Fair enough. But there is no reason why one cannot first convert ft to m, use SI
as is, then convert back from m to ft.  If a user really want to use ft instead
of m but retain all other SI units ALWAYS, then create a MYUnitSystem domain,
and use )set unit MYUnitSystem. The implementation would be so much easier and
you still retain the flexibility. Flexibility and generality may complicate
usage as well as simplify usage. We have to balance the them.

Dimensional correctness does not require RDA or even DA (DA is used to guess an

Reverse dimensional analysis, is useful for providing the user with possibly

Sure, but that does not mean one has to do it for all possible conversions, only
the most useful ones should be provided, with functionality that allows, though
not as convenient, the very special user to change units.

Ignoring it in this example would mean the equation is not dimensionally

OK, let me try to explain again.  A quantity is dimensionless means its
dimension can be reduced to 1. But sometimes, it is more meaningful (physically
or mathematically) to view these as a quotient (this is like, but not totally,
we sometimes rewrite 1 as 2/2 to add fractions). Even SI recognizes this in
stating that the unit of a phase angle is m. m^(-1) = 1 because this IS the
definition (arc length spanned by the angle, divided by the radius). Just
because the dimensions cancel out (making it dimensionless) does not mean the
dimension is not there.

Definitely. We can have a nanosytem domain, and other domains of UnitSystem(S)
as experts need them. That is the beauty of Axiom's categorical approach:
unifying domains with a common set of API.

This ought to work, but not immediately; One problem may be compiling
several aldor stanzas together - in this case you need to be able to
refer to earlier stanzas within the aldor block.

Eg:

\begin{aldor}
	AldorCat: Category == with { funstuff } 
\end{aldor}


\begin{aldor}
	AldorDomain: AldorCat with { ... } == add { ... }
\end{aldor}

To compile the second you'll need access to the .ao file generated by
the first.  One solution may be to keep a list of .ao files within
MathAction's session.  Alternatively, each stanza could implicitly
contain all the previous ones.

I debugged this a little but hit a wall. In 'ARR2CAT' you find the appropriate conversion operation::

    if R has CoercibleTo(OutputForm) then

      coerce(m:%) ==
        l : List List OutputForm
        l := [[qelt(m,i,j) :: OutputForm _
                  for j in minColIndex(m)..maxColIndex(m)] _
                  for i in minRowIndex(m)..maxRowIndex(m)]
        matrix l

which really looks alright. Note also, that 
\begin{axiom}
  Union(INT, FLOAT) has KOERCE OUTFORM
\end{axiom}

and the operation is not overridden in 'ARRAY2' or 'IIARRAY2'. But the miracle is, inserting a 'print("hi")$Lisp' in the above operation shows that it actually doesn't get invoked. Somehow it seems to me that rather the following function from 'HOAGG' gets invoked::

       coerce(x:%):OutputForm ==
         bracket
            commaSeparate [a::OutputForm for a in parts x]$List(OutputForm)

which can be seen by looking at:
\begin{axiom}
n:TwoDimensionalArray Union(Integer, Float):=new(2,2,0)
n::OUTFORM::SEX
\end{axiom}

Ah, OK - yes, I can see how your design implies that.

Yes, with the exception of the namespace issue it looks good.  You have
a valid point about using up namespace - more on that below.

I guess that's pretty much what I pictured, yes.  I think it's less
important to identify things like potential vs. kinetic energy and just
identify that <quantity> IS an energy.  This can be helpful in building
an intuition about the system you are working on, even without more
specific information.

At the student level I'm not sure I agree.

There have been times in the past when I would have liked to have RDA
to help me understand the calculations I was working on in a "physical"
way, but this can probably be defined as a deficiency on my part.

That's most definitely a good feature to design in - I might set
UnitSystem rather than unit, but that's just a quibble.

What about by default creating a UserUnits system, and "importing" the
SI definitions into it as the "default" state?  This would amount to
putting user-friendly tools on creating a custom unitsystem domain, and
hide the need to do so from the user.  The system need only define the
standard environments, but if we allow the UserUnits system to
automatically import definitions while preserving and allowing local
overrides transparently, this would allow for full flexibility.  Best
of all, it can be defined "above" the more correct, structured systems
and ignored unless it is actually of interest.  So, upon consideration,
I vote for the SI/MKS/CGS domain proposal, since it can be built upon
for other environments which might be less "Axiom-like" in behavior.

To my mind the important things are a) to be able to work in a useful
way for the target audience, and b) to start with definitions in full
rigor and build "looser and friendlier" systems on top of that, so
additional power up to fully rigorous is available depending on the
situation.  I am very appreciative of these emails - they have made me
think about dimensions and units in ways I hadn't previously
considered, and that is valuable as an insight into the nature of those
systems all by itself :-).

OK.  I guess we would need to find some place where such things are
cataloged, and impliment that catalog in Axiom - unfortunately I have
no idea where to go for such a document.

I disagree here, although I concede you have valid points and the
default should probably be your way.  When I (or a student) am working
in Axiom on a physics problem, I have certain definite meanings
attached to symbols like J, nm, N, etc.  I want my use of these symbols
as variables to be illegal, since if I do so I am introducing the
chance for MASSIVE confusion down the road.  My mind is trained to look
at kg as kilograms when I am working on a problem with units as opposed
to numbers, and I would prefer that the CAS enforce this to make sure I
don't make mistakes.  However, based on my experience with Maxima you
are correct about the difficulties this introduces, and so if it is
done it should be built as an extension to the "correct" units
environment, not as the default.  I think this is doable, and the
design of the main units package does not need to specifically
accomidate it.

Heh - well, that's certainly fair enough :-).

In the case of \begin{axiom} sections, what MathAction does is
generate a .input or .spad file for each section and then calls
Axiom just once using stdin to pass )read or )compile commands
for each section as appropriate. So, for each web page there is
only one Axiom session and the namespace is the same for the
entire page. (Except for comments containing \begin{axiom}
sections which are initially each run in their own Axiom session
before being appended to the page.)

Perhaps I can do the same thing for Aldor? Can I run Aldor
with a series of 'include' files - one for each \begin{aldor}
section? Would that solve the problem of referring to earlier
sections?

To make this work properly I also need some kind of unique separator
string between the Aldor compiler output for each include file.
In the case of Axiom that separator is the interpreter '(99) -> '
prompt sequence. For Spad sections, the \begin{axiom} \end{axiom}
group is replaced with <pre>formatted</pre> HTML tag containing
the Spad code followed by a <div> ... </div> section containing
the Spad compiler output (which appears as "folded" text"). Can
you suggest a way to generate such a separator for Aldor compiler
output if the input consists of a series of 'include' files?

The use of 'include' files above should handle this case, right?

Where do the .ao files need to be stored in order to be accessible
to Axiom commands? Can more than one .ao file be generate per run
of the Aldor compiler? Is it sufficient if they are saved in the
current working directory?

Thanks for sending this revised file. It gets further, but
Unfortunately it still does not complete.

The new src_aldor.tgs file that you sent does not contain any
Makefile, however I figured that you expected me to initially
do

  # document Makefile.pamphlet

in order to generate the Makefile and the type

  # make 2>&1 | tee aldor.log

The result of doing this is contained in the new attached log
file.

The log file contains two runs of make in sequence. The first run
stops with the message:

make[1]: *** No rule to make target
`/home/page/repository/axiom--main--1/int/aldor/dep_spad.stamp', needed
by `/home/page/repository/axiom--main--1/int/aldor/saxiom/spadset.mk'.
Stop.

To continue I did

  # touch ../../int/aldor/dep_spad.stamp
  # make 2>&1 | tee -a aldor.log

Is this due to another missing file? I noticed that your new src_aldor
File is a smaller than the previous one. Should I have first untarred
the previous file and then overlayed it with the new one?

The build progressed further but then apparently stopped because
a statement in the generated Makefile exceeded some command line
length limit for either make or /bin/sh.

What linux operating system and utility versions are you using
to do your development? I am trying to build this on the
axiom-developer/MathAction server which is running RedHat 9
(updated almost, I think, to the level when RedHat discontinued
it's development about two years ago in favor of Fedora). The
server runs in shared virtual server mode.

Is there some way your java program can easily generate a more
Portable Makefile? Or do you know of anyway to allocate a
Larger command line buffer?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Axiom Developers;

I think the continuing exchange on the units package for Axiom is
very interesting and potentially useful to a wider audience, therefore
I have created an initial summary of the discussion on the design
here:

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/UnitsAndDimensions

The authors (and other interested parties!) are invited to review
these wiki pages and update/correct/edit them as seems appropriate.
New pages on this subject can also easily be added. I would like
these pages to gradually evolve to reflect design decisions and
trial code segments as this package is developed.

Thanks everyone!

Agreed.  What about this - create such a domain as the "default"
domain, "use" SI units for defaults, and provide tools for the user to
make changes?  The changes would occur within the Default "working"
unit domain, assuming any were made - otherwise, it would look just
like the SI domain.  If one wanted to work in an environment which flat
out disallowed such setting changes, )set UnitSystem SI (or whatever
system desired) would take the user to the system defined SI domain
instead of the Default environment.  Does this map to what Axiom can
do?

Hehe - fair enough!  In fact, I think such things can be built as a
layer on top of your system, which is undoubtedly the most robust way
to handle things.  So I vote for doing it your way, and then if I
really want some of what I say I want it can be implimented on top of
the core system.

Ah :-). Thanks for helping clarify all of this - it's definitely

OK, point.  As a possible future extension to this environment though,
I may try and code up a way to do as many such conversions (arbitrary
unit -> current environment) as possible, since usually the unit that
causes the biggest problem in a problem is the obscure uncommon one you
have to go dig up the conversion factor for.  This argues for as broad
a knowledge of units in Axiom as possible, although I admit this should
probably be done over time and not as part of the initial effort.
 
> Ignoring it in this example would mean the equation is not

I think this is a weak spot in my understanding of dimensionality, so I
apologize if I'm being dense here.  If we take C=%pi*d where C is a
circumference, %pi is %pi, and d is diameter, and look at the
dimensions, we have:

          degree
Length =  ------ Length
          radian

Casually, this doesn't look at all balanced.  Does it mean that when we
define the dimensionality of the variable C we need to define it as:

 degree
 ------ Length
 radian

rather than just Length?  I suppose in once sense this preserves the
information that C is a curve instead of a straight line, but I don't
quite see how the ramifications of that play out.  I suppose if you
then describe the distance a wheel would move in x if you rotate it
around its center n times the degree/radian information might be
pertinant, so perhaps there is reason to do this after all, but I think
it will require careful though on how to deal with this situation.

OK, I think I'm getting it.  So what we need to do is examine the cases
where it is actually useful to retain this information, and see what
behaviors are rigorous/needed/useful.  Definitely in some cases we need
to canel dimensions out - we don't want something described in (say)
kg/s multiplied by seconds to wind up as kg*s/s, but if there are cases
where m/m is useful to preserve there would seem to be a problem with
having a general rule.  Could unit and dimension cancelation be handled
on a per dimension basis?

OK, cool.  So we might actually develop a situation where, for
different kinds of work, we have different standard domains defined
(say, as an example, if someone is working with radio telescope data
and equations, they can do )set UnitSystem RadioTelescope having
previously defined the desired unit conventions for such work.  I
guess, thinking about it, my scenarios for unit use were too narrowly
focused on the case of students, where arbitrary units will appear for 
any reason and no reason (sometimes just to make them look them up and
do the conversion, which always annoyed me as an extra and unnecessary
potential source of numerical errors but in retrospect was probably
good training.)  For "real world" use, that case is not terribly
useful, and Axiom is definitely not focused on introductory student
problems :-).

Agreed.  That could actually be very handy for certain types of

Well, that last argument has got me dead to rights ;-).  Conceded.

Good point.  Perhaps we could make the autoscaling configurable though,
so people can avoid scaling to less used prefixes unless they so
desire?  (This is so people have the option of only using metric
prefixes they can readily match to some physical standard they are
familiar with, such as a centimeter.)  Usually when the computer tries
to be "smart" like that it is a good idea to allow the user to take
matters into their own hands if they so desire.  (At least, in my
experience - evidently not all software developers agree with me :-/)

So would I - I think I've finally understood the overall arguments now,
and for myself I'm deeply impressed with the insight you have brought
to this problem.  For what it's worth, you have convinced me your
overall direction is the best one to take, and can serve as a good
foundation for tweaks and extensions as desired.

Thank you!  This has been an education in and of itself, which I think
is one of the real benefits of a system like Axiom - it forces you to
think deeply about what you are really trying to do.  (Or at least, to
work at understanding others who are up to the deep thinking ;-)

Do you want a complete summary of the email list discussions, or just
the ones that seem to lead to what eventually becomes the final design?
 (I must confess I'm not really sure how archiving of Axiom's email
system works, since I just save most of them myself on my machine in
Kmail - should the wiki be used to preserve discarded ideas and the
reasons they were discarded, or just focus on what is eventually
accepted and provide links to the full discussion?  If the email
archive is stable and readily available it would probably be cleaner to
focus the wiki page on the actual workable design related emails, with
links to the discussion tree for other stuff.)

I think the summary should be more *constructive* and *synthetic*
rather than archival. It should accurately reflect (within reason)
the current understanding of the problem and solution - not the
history - except perhaps for attribution of relevant ideas to
original authors etc. This usually means that some (now irrelevant)
parts of the discussion, proposals and experimental code should
actually be deleted after the direction is clear and more
well-advanced.

All axiom-developer emails (including notices of changes on the
MathAction wiki) are archived at:

http://mail.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer

This is the primary and complete archive. There are also a few
other places on the web where our discussions are duplicated,
e.g. gmane.

> - should the wiki be used to preserve discarded ideas and the

I say definitely just the latter: focus on what is eventually
accepted and what remains controversial. Eliminate the stuff
in between.

I think the Internet email archives are very stable. Although like
you, for convenience I often rely more on my own local archive of
these emails, after several system upgrades, failures and re-
organization I now find that my personal archive is less reliable
than mail.nongnu.org.

So I agree that the wiki pages should focus on actual workable
design ideas. Often the original text of the emails also has to
be adjusted periodically to use the current terminology etc. It
often takes more time to be concise and accurate so that someone
can quickly understand the main points (that what the wiki pages
are good for), rather than just record the complete and verbose
history (that's what the dumb archives are good for).

If you don't like it and you can somehow determine the type of R 
automatically, and it is something simple like Integer then why not writing

Polytope(): Exports == Implementation where
     Exports == with
       vertices: % -> (R: Ring, Matrix R);
       ...

That should work in Axiom (+ dependent types).

By the way, is there a reason for constructing a nullary function 
Polytop() instead of just the constant Polytope? (Sorry, I have not 
looked at polymake.)

As some of you might know Aldor's intermediate name was A# (A-sharp). I 
once heard of a project which was called B-flat and if I am not wrong it 
did exactly address the "problem" that Axiom was to complicated for a 
wider audience. (Please correct me if I am wrong.) In my opinion, the 
idea should be that internally Axiom/Aldor is strict and that should 
NEVER change. However, I couln't say anything against another layer (I 
my eyes that could be the work of a user interface) which tries hard to 
guess what the user had in mind. The user input would be equipped with 
all the necessary type information to run a strict program internally. 
One cannot expect everyone to know all the hairy details of the 
algorithms. How many people bother to understand the Risch algorithm 
just to solve an intergral. If they have a CAS at hand which translates 
their input and gives a reasonable output _and_ is able to tell what the 
output actually means (that may depend on the an ambiguous 
interpretation of the input).

So I would vote for a two-layered AXIOM.
1) internal libraries (strict)
2) user interface (fuzzy)
and I would like to see these layers being separate things.
A user should however always be allowed to just use the strict mode if 
he is knowledgable enough. And other people should be encouraged to 
provide enough information.

One approach could be like that...

This would work, I think (and the problem with .ao files goes away),

The only compiler output will be error messages from the compiler; If
you call the compiler via axiom (ie. ')co aldor-section.as'), then an
axiom prompt should be a perfectly good separator.

I'm using SuSE 9.2; the make version is 3.80 (you may have the previous
version; 3.80 was released in october 2002). The problem seems to be
that Make.functions hasn't been generated from Make.functions.pamphlet;
if you do this manually, it'll get further.

The second error was not due to an excessively long command line, IIRC
bash has no such limit, especially in 'for' statements.  The problem was
an ungenerated include file.

"Easily", not sure - I think it would mean a different approach, since
the java program currently just spits out sets of mutually dependent
domains, and is just there to help make on its way. 

One way of simplifying matters would be to invoke 3 sequential builds;
Once to run document on everything, then for the dependency graphs, and
then once more to build the library.  However, this may well still need
a more recent make.

Subject: [Axiom-mail] Non elementary integration 

Hi.
In the axiom manual I find

"Integration is the reverse process of differentiation, that is, an 
integral of a function f with respect to a variable x is any function g 
such that D(g, x) is equal to f.
....
Given an elementary function to integrate, Axiom returns a formal 
integral as above only when it can prove that the integral is not 
elementary and not when it cannot determine the integral. In this rare 
case it prints a message that it cannot determine if an elementary 
integral exists.

Now if I write
integrate(exp(x)/x,x)
I obtain
Ei(x)
while if I write
integrate(exp(x)/x^2,x)
I get a form integral. But the integral of exp(x)/x^2 can be given in 
terms of Ei(x) as exp(x).
In fact I believed that the axiom can be able to find the solution that is

integrate(exp(x)/x^2,x) --> Ei(x)-exp(x)/x

But from the manual I deduce that exp(x)/x^2  can be prooved not 
elementary integrable. Why  exp(x)/x  is integrable while  exp(x)/x^2 not?

Well, exp(x)/x is *not* elementarily integrable, Ei(x) is simply defined to be
its integral. Ei(x) is *not* an elementary function. (in the mathematical
sense)

However, Axiom should still be able to figure out your integral. The
corresponding code is in intpm.spad, but your integral doesn't fit, it seems.

If you are willing to do some research, we might be able to figure out how to
improve the pattern matcher. There is also code by Manuel Bronstein (written in
maple), that would handle special functions. Maybe this should be integrated,
too.

Note that there are also two bugs (with fixes) filed on IssueTracker, so if you
rely heavily on integrals, you might want to patch your axiom:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/198IntegrateSinX2XIsNotHandled

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/199IntegrateExpX2ExpXXX

The first patch is hidden in a comment, you'll have to look for it.

Stefano,

The key words are "elementary function". Some integration is done by
the Risch Algorithm. Essentially the Risch Algorithm can integrate
any function which results in something like

    f(x) + log 

exp(x)/x^2 cannot be integrated into this form. Axiom does some
integration by pattern matching and it appears that the pattern
matcher does not know exp(x)/x^2

Ah, yes I see. That would be real easy for me to integrate with
MathAction. If we *only* provide Aldor compilation via axiom
(as opposed to directly calling the compiler) is this a significant
limitation? Or is this the expected mode of interaction?

Suppose I generate a series of Aldor compiles from axiom like this:

  )co aldor-section1.as
  )co aldor-section2.as
  )co aldor-section3.as

instead of using Aldor includes. Does the problem of having to
know the names of previous Aldor compiles return? Maybe this will
be more clear once I actually have Aldor running inside Axiom and
get a chance to play with it.

Yes I had the previous version 3.79.x. I just downloaded and
compiled Gnu make 3.80.

Yes that did it! The Aldor/Axiom build has now in the process of
compiling the Axiom library. What I did was the following:

  1) Built Axiom from axiom--main--1--Patch-44
  2) cd src; tar xzvf src_aldor.tgz
  3) document Makefile.pamphlet
  4) make
  5) touch .../aldor/int/dep_spad.stamp
  6) document Make.functions.pamphlet
  7) make

Probably the intermediate make attempt step 4) is unnecessary.
The build has just completed successfully. The log ends like this:

Yes, I upgraded to gnu make 3.8. That might well be a factor in
the successful completion of your aldor/axiom build.

List price for Derive is about $200US and student price is about $100US. 
Its core-level mathematical capabilities are equivalent to nearly every 
"general" CAS out there, and anything you can implement in them can be 
implemented in Derive. I have never been able to afford Maple or 
Mathematica or even Reduce, so I can't comment on them.

Ease of use: Derive is much easier to use than Maxima, although I think 
that's just because I've been using Derive since about 1994 (on DOS back 
then!). I just started with Axiom, so I can't comment on it either. 
Axiom has a great reputation on the "gentoo-science" mailing list, so 
I'm learning how to use it.

Development does appear to have slowed down -- I wouldn't say stopped. 
The release level is 6.1. A couple of years ago, the founders of Soft 
Warehouse sold the business to Texas Instruments, so the business 
decisions are made now by TI rather than the founders as near as I can 
tell. In any event, Derive is essentially "complete" -- its main market 
is students.

I haven't found anything it can't do in a professional environment, 
though. My needs for a CAS right now are mostly to deal with equations 
in computer performance modeling -- Markov chains, ODEs, Laplace 
Transforms, etc. Derive handles them well and was my only practical 
alternative on Windows systems until I got a working Maxima port a year 
or so ago. But if you need Grobner basis calculations, well, they have 
that too ... :)

Ok, I followed step 2. from Martin's web page:

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AldorForAxiom

and created axiom.as in $ALDORROOT/include

Now the compile of rr.as completes successfully and Martin's

So the final step is just for me to put this version of
Axiom into production on the MathAction server.

Support for domains and packages is now in the testing stage. The
Axiom/Aldor interface has been updated for the open source version of
Axiom (as of Patch-44) by Peter Broadbery. **Thanks Peter!** A new
version of Axiom based on axiom--main--1--Patch-44 and Peter's
interface has been installed here on MathAction.

Aldor on MathAction

  This is a simple example of how to use Aldor on MathAction.

First compile some function, for example this non-recursive
method to compute the factorial:
\begin{aldor}
#include "axiom.as"

fact(n: PositiveInteger): PositiveInteger == {
    n <= 1 => 1;
    res: PositiveInteger := 1;
    while n > 1 repeat {
        res := res * n;
        n := n-1;
    }
    res
 }
\end{aldor}

Now call the function in Axiom as you would any other
Axiom function:
\begin{axiom}
fact(11)
\end{axiom}

Building Axiom with Aldor

  (preliminary instructions)

We plan to (re-)integrate the linkage of Axiom with the Aldor as an
optional part of the Axiom build in the next release of Axiom 3 beta.
Until then to build Axiom with Aldor support you must do the following:

1. Make sure you have the most up to date version of gnu make

   make --version
   GNU Make 3.80

   If not, then upgrade your version of make or linux first.

2. Install the Java development kit JDK

   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp

3. Download and install Aldor as described here:

   http://www.aldor.org

   Be sure to set ALDORROOT and the PATH to Aldor properly for
   your system.

4. Download Peter's Aldor patches and make files here

   "aldor.diff":aldor.diff

   "src_aldor2.tgz":src_aldor2.tgz

5. Update your Axiom source code to Patch-44 (or greater):

     cd axiom--main--1
     tla update

6. Apply the Aldor patches::

     patch -p 1 < ~/aldor.diff

7. Now build a new version of Axiom::

     ./configure
     (set AXIOM environment variables)
     make

8. Extract the Aldor make files::

     cd src
     tar xzvf ~/src_aldor2.tgz

9. Build the Aldor interface using the following commands:

   1. cd aldor

   2. document Makefile.pamphlet

   3. touch ../../int/aldor/dep_spad.stamp

   4. document Make.functions.pamphlet

   5. make 2>&1 | tee aldor.log

   The build might take up to 2 hours or some machines. 

10. Finally, download and save the file

    "axiom.as":axiom.as

    into 'aldor/1.0.2/linux/include/' of your aldor (binary) distribution.

    Congratulations! Now you should be able to compile Aldor files in Axiom.

11. Save the fact example above into a file named 'fact.as'

12. Start Axiom

13. Compile and run the example file

    )co fact.as
    fact(5)

Pamphlet files are latex files with three additional pieces of syntax:

1) chunk definition


<<any string>>=
    this can be anything and is called a chunk definition.
@

2) chunk use

This is the use of a chunk. You just use <<any string>> (assuming it has
a definition somehwhere. The information will be expanded in place. Think
of chunks as macros with no parameters.

3)

You can quote any string inline using [[some string]]



Other than that a pamphlet file is a latex file. The steps are:

   notangle foo.pamphlet --> foo.code (pure code)
   noweave  foo.pamphlet --> foo.tex  (pure latex)


So if you know how to do something in latex it all works the same.

Subject: steps towards better TeXmacs interface

Hello *,

If some program (e.g., TeXmacs) wants to communicate with axiom (via 
pipes), it must know in a reliable way, where axiom prompts begin and end, 
when axiom waits for input, where parts of axiom output written in LaTeX 
begin and end, which parts of output are error messages, information about 
the type of the expression just calculated, etc. In order to do so 
reliably, axiom has to insert some (parametrized) markers at some key 
positions of its output. Approach based on partial parsing of the plain 
text output is (1) unreliable (as a user, I can print any string, and 
confuse the interface); (2) ugly (axiom already knows where are its 
prompts, but this information is not obvious in its plain-text output; why 
should the interface guess, if axiom can tell it for sure?). The current 
interface (written by me long ago) uses this last approach.

Another free computer algebra system, maxima, has incorporated inserting 
of parametrized markers in the key positions of its output some time ago. 
Now it is easy to interface it to almost any external program: one just 
assigns appropriate values to the marker strings, and then maxima speaks 
the protocol required by this external program. Maxima developers called 
this "the transition from the stone age to the bronze age" (the idea is 
that using corba or some such thing would be the enlightment era).

Axiom is still in the stone age in this respect (a more structured and 
predictable input-output). I am now trying to move it to the bronze age. 
The first (and rather obvious) place is interp/i-util.boot.pamphlet
I renamed the procedure MKPROMPT to MKPROMPT0, and inserted

$InterfaceStrings : Record(PromptPrefix:String,PromptSuffix:String) := ['"[",'"]"]

MKPROMPT() ==
  STRCONC($InterfaceStrings.PromptPrefix,MKPROMPT0(),$InterfaceStrings.PromptSuffix)

This works, and my prompts are now in brackets (of course, this is just a 
test). The next step is to find all the other prompt-like things in axiom 
(i.e., output strings immediately preceeding user input). One of them is 
the exit confirmation, for example; I'm sure there are many others. Each 
prompt-like string should now be preceeded by 
$InterfaceStrings.PromptPrefix and followed by 
$InterfaceStrings.PromptSuffix . And this is only the first step, there 
will be, e.g., $InterfaceStrings.LatexPrefix and 
$InterfaceStrings.LatexSuffix and some other markers.

So, I have a few questions to the gurus:

1. What is the correct file to put the definition and initialisation of 
$InterfaceStrings ?

2. Is there some way in which this initialisation could be made dependent 
on external conditions? For example, can I pass a command-line argument to 
AXIOMsys, and check it in boot code? Or check an environment variable in 
the boot code?
At the moment, I know only one way to pass some information to axiom: 
.axiom.input. But it would not be a good idea for TeXmacs, for example, to 
overwrite the user's .axiom.input (if the user has one).

Making text exchanges between axiom and an external program to follow some 
structured, predictable protocol (without playing guessing games) is the 
first and the most important goal. But there are further necessary steps. 
The current TeX generation (algebra/tex.spad.pamphlet) was written 15 
years ago. Naturally, it does not produce modern standard LaTeX. I've made 
a number of changes in tex.spad.pamphlet, to produce more 
standards-complying LaTeX code instead of some historic relicts ( \over , 
\sub , \root ... \of ... , etc.). But this is not exactly what's needed. 
TeXmacs has some strange requirements of its own (e.g., using \* for 
multiplication). Therefore, I want to leave the old TeX generation alone, 
and to introduce the new kind of output: texmacs. So that it will be 
possible to say
)set output texmacs on
OK, I can easily duplicate tex.spad.pamphlet (should this be a new file, 
texmacs.spad.pamphlet, or I just double the contents of tex.spad.pamphlet 
?) I'll rename the domain TexFormat to TexmacsFormat, and make the 
improvements I want. But what to do next? My (very incomplete...) 
understanding is that I should insert the necessary pieces into 
setvars.boot.pamphlet and setvart.boot.pamphlet (based on the TeX pieces, 
with renamings and some small changes). But setvars.boot.pamphlet says 
that if I change the boot code (and I'm going to do this), I have to 
translate it to lisp and insert it into the same file. How do I do this, 
exactly?

The new domain TexmacsFormat is the natural place to put the line-breaking 
functionality. Some ideas can be taken from the C code which does such 
line-breaking, and which is available. Of course, it is much more natural 
to do this in the spad domain, where all the information about the 
expression structure is available. Also, this C code generates LaTeX which 
gives a reasonably-looking output, but is mathematically meaningless (it 
uses \array's all over the place for things which are not arrays). This 
leads to the fact that, if this C code is used, it is absolutely 
impossible (and never will be possible) to copy a (part of) output by the 
mouse and insert in into an input field (because it is not possible to 
reconstruct the mathematical meaning of an expression from this obfuscated 
LaTeX). And this goal is highly desirable. Therefore, the aim of 
TexmacsForm will be to generate a meaningful LaTeX, with line breaking, 
which can be used as a source of drag-and-drop in TeXmacs.

There is another possibility, which requires some thought. What if we send 
expression tree from axiom to TeXmacs as an S-expression, instead of 
serializing it via LaTeX? TeXmacs understands not only latex: fields, but 
also scheme: fields. Generating scheme syntax from an axiom expression may 
well be easier than generating LaTeX. Line breaking can be done on the 
TeXmacs side, where the necessary information is available (it is in 
principle impossible to tell, what is the width of a sub-expression after 
typesetting, without actually typesetting it). But this is, probably, a 
more long-term project. For now, I'd better keep as much as possible from 
the current interface, but make it more robust and less ugly.

What do you think?

Dear Andrey,

just two comments:

regarding the markers and in and output parsing you should short circuit
yourself wiht Kai Kaminski, I suppose.

Although this goal may be highly desirable, it will work only for some
domains. For others it is doomed to fail, simply because not all the
information is in the output. In fact, it will probably work only for those
domains that are ConvertibleTo InputForm...

So the probably better way to do this is to capture the label of the
output. The object is stored there, you don't need to reconstruct it. Example:

(1) -> )lib POLYTOPE

(1) -> cube 3

   (1)  "cube3"
                                                               Type: Polytope
(2) -> %::INFORM
 
   Cannot convert from type Polytope to InputForm for value
   "cube3"

(2) -> %::SEX
 
   Cannot convert from type Polytope to SExpression for value
   "cube3"

(2) -> %%(1)

   (2)  "cube3"
                                                               Type: Polytope
(3) -> hVector(%%(1))

   (3)  [1,3,3,1]
                                                         Type: Vector Integer

I forgot to ask one more practical question. The prompt prefix and suffix 
will contain non-printable chars, \0x02 (ctrl-b) and \0x05 (ctrl-e). How 
can I include them in a boot string? Is literal embedding of these bytes 
inside a string enough? (in emacs, ctrl-q ctrl-something inserts the 
literal ctrl-something byte at the cursor position). Should it be prefixed 
by _ ? In common lisp this method works: any strange byte within a string 
will be printed, when the string is printed (I used this in the maxima 
source for communication with TeXmacs).

I am not surprised at this, but I suspect handling it well will be
critically important to the acceptability of Axiom for a wide variety
of applications.

[snip]  

Does this imply that for a significant subset of mathematical
expressions, it should not be legal to select a subset of the
expression piecemeal?

I think I know what Andrey is thinking about here.  Let's say we have
the following expression:

				  2
				 b  + 2 a
				 -------- + c
				    d
 				 ------------
				    f + e

and we want to select:

				    2
				   b  + 2 a
				   -------- 
				      d

as our input in the next line.  The natural thing to want to do in a
graphical mathematical document environment is graphically select the
desired subexpression and paste that to the input line.  I suspect the
objection is that there may be hidden or non-hidden constraints within
Axiom's knowledge of the original expression that make selection of the
subset problematic, and won't be preserved?  Perhaps one way to do this
"safely" would be to "flatten" the expression to the basic types you
would get if you just typed in the displayed variables, and warn that
all original mathematical knowledge of the parent object has been lost
in the copying process?

This, however, is a violation of Axiom's philosophy of wanting to "Do
It Right."  The more interesting, but far more challenging problem, is
to map the constraints of Axiom's mathematical knowledge into a
graphical interface environment.  I rather suspect there will be a
fundamental clash between the "beginner mentality" that is often
associated with the use of such environments and Axiom's philosophy,
but that just makes it more interesting :-).  The ideal case would be
to have the ability to make assumptions about one's environment, and as
those assumptions are added or removed the interface behavior changes
according to what is allowed in the new "environment."  E.g., there
will be operations that might be legal if certain assumptions are made,
that are not true in general, and if your environment is less or more
general the interface knows that and acts accordingly.

Not sure that's even doable in the case of TeXmacs - IIRC it's rules
for mathematical interaction are those of a document editor, and not
really responsive to mathematical constraints. It would be difficult
even with something like a lisp interface, because interaction
behaviors would have to be defined, and some kind of mapping made
between those mappings and mathematical behavior.  What a nifty
research project :-).

Generally when you want a certain special output mode in Axiom the technique
is to use
  )set output texmacs on
which sets a flag enabling the output.

It's "old-style" tex but still seems to work. The book uses it everywhere.
Why is it necessary to change it? Given the hundreds of things that need
work this is pretty low on my list but you're welcome to investigate what
might be needed. I believe that the line-break algorithm might be sensitive
to these tex symbols but memory fails me in the details.

This would be the correct path. Then texmacs can adapt axiom to its needs.
Writing output delimiters could be transparent since they would not
normally be seen by users and can be removed by Texmacs

I wish I knew what needed to be done exactly but I haven't modified that
code in 15 years so your guess is nearly as good as mine. All I can suggest
is to experiment and document. Please document as you go so we don't have
to reverse engineer it a second time.

I'm not sure what it means to "drag and drop" a 2D expression into a 1D
input line. Who flattens the line? I've never seen a specification of a
mapping from 1D <-> 2D. We do it all the time by hand, of course, but 
that's not good enough for a machine. Furthermore each Axiom domain
determines its own OutputForm representation (internal structure -> 2D).
The surface structure (print representation) might not carry all of
the needed information, most of which is hidden in the internal type.

The notion of an S-expression form of an expression comes up a few times
a year. Axiom does not have such a notion. The closest you can come to
it (as far as I'm aware) is to:

Aternatively you can get the LaTex output string:

   (4)  ["$$","-{\cos ","\left(","{x} ","\right)}","$$"]

Value = ((|OutputForm|) WRAPPED BRACKET (AGGLST "\"$$\"" "\"-{\\cos \""
"\"\\left(\"" "\"{x} \"" "\"\\right)}\"" "\"$$\""))

or the text form:

(5) -> )lisp (|parseAndInterpret| "integrate(sin(x),x)::OutputForm")

   (5)  - cos(x)
                                                             Type: OutputForm
Value = ((|OutputForm|) WRAPPED "-" (|cos| |x|))

or the actual string output:

Axiom's algebra gets output to a stream called |$algebraOutputStream|
Thus you can get the output you want by:

)set message autoload off
)lisp (progn
          ; we need a new output stream that is backed by a string
        (setq tmpout (make-string-output-stream))
          ; we hold on to the regular algebra output stream
        (setq save |$algebraOutputStream|)
          ; we capture the algebra output into the string stream
        (setq |$algebraOutputStream| tmpout)
          ; we generate output from string input
        (|parseAndInterpret| "(x+1)^9")
          ; we save the output into the result variable
        (setq result (get-output-stream-string |$algebraOutputStream|))
          ; we restore the regular algebra output stream
        (setq |$algebraOutputStream| save)
          ; and we return the string as our value
        result)

)lisp result

result contains the output from axiom that you want.

and sure enough! Axiom parses and interprets the string.

The result appears as stdout and the value returned
seems to contain the type information. The "WRAPPED"

I'd say that this is not the way things work in Axiom. There is a hack on
MathAction that does this kind of thing.

But please keep the following in mind:

Axiom is designed in a way that you can, for example, replace the domain EXPR ?
with something entirely different, keeping only the interface the same. Of
course, coercing to SExpression is part of the interface, but I would suggest
that you don't work against Axioms philosophy.

Note also that "hidden" type information is crucial:

(13) -> 3*(y*x::XPOLY INT)

   (13)  y x 3
                                                    Type: XPolynomial Integer

are you referring to?

Although I think I see your point about "not the way things
work in Axiom", I also think you are being too strict when
it comes to user interface. Axiom is designed as a deeply
nested series of levels. A the user interface level a lot of
"less strict" things are done in the name of being more
"user friendly". This is a difficult problem and I think
achieving a truly effective user interface is still more a
matter of art (and luck) than it is a matter of good design
or engineering.

We should not forget that Numerical Algorithms Group put a lot
of work into Axiom to produce OpenMath output. One of the goals
of OpenMath is to encode precisely this kind of information with
an aim to being able to communicate mathematics in full generality
between different computer algebra systems. And of course this
could also include between a compute algebra system and an
intelligent editor/user interface. All of the NAG OpenMath code
is availabe but has not (yet) been integrated into the open source
version of Axiom.

Greetings!

Here is what we've been doing since early FC:

int
main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {

#ifdef NEED_NONRANDOM_SBRK
#if SIZEOF_LONG == 4
	if (!syscall(SYS_personality,PER_LINUX32))
#else
        if (!syscall(SYS_personality,PER_LINUX))
#endif
	  execvp(argv[0],argv);
#endif


so either:

1) configure is not detecting the situation and defining
   NEED_NONRANDOM_SBRK
2) the syscall syntax is changed
3) the problem lies somewhere else

it would appear.

Take care,

Subject: JavaView - Interactive 3D Geometry and	Visualization

http://www.javaview.de

JavaView is a 3D geometry viewer and a mathematical visualization
software. The web-integration allows display of 3D geometries and
interactive geometry experiments in any HTML document on the internet.
JavaView also runs as application on local computers from a Unix or Dos
command  prompt. The open API of JavaView enables a smooth integration
as 3D viewer and advanced visualization toolkit into commercial software
like  Mathematica and Maple.

JavaView-Lite: this tiny version of JavaView is optimized for fast
download and contains the viewer module only, without any dialogs,
inspectors and geometry algorithms. The lite version is mainly used to
display precomputed geometry models inside web pages such as the solid
shown to the right.

----------

JavaView looks very interesting both for integration with Axiom
and (possibly) for interactive graphics via MathAction and (maybe)
also in the new AxiomUI project.

At the above web site I was not able to find any information
about licensing. During download it says "registration" is
required but it does not seem to place any other restrictions
on the use or duplication of the code.

Does anyone know whether it might be possible to consider
this program "open source"?

Subject: RE: Mathaction and polymake problem

Sending this also to axiom-developer...

Thank you Bill for your fast actions! That's really great! I tried around a
little, but I didn't have the idea to write the error message into a
file... stupid me.

While we are at it: I'd suggest that you disable the possibility to comment on
FrontPage, if this is easily done. (If it's more than five minutes of work,
don't do it)

Sometime in the future there should also be a redesign of the structure of
MathAction, but I'd like to think a little about it. IssueTracker has become
the most important tool for me. Maybe the contents of the pages WishList and
SummerOfCode should be transferred to individual IssueTracker pages. On the
other hand, I'd like to be able to group the issues somehow by topic: it is
quite handy to have a page with integration problems where they are all grouped
together. Maybe the solution is to keep the pages as they are -- i.e., with a
short description - but to point to the appropriate IssueTracker pages for
elaborations.

The second thing that really occupies me: I think it's high time to make some
advertisements for axiom again. It has changed quite a bit from the last
announcement. Tim: if we make an announcement in (mid-)September, which patch
number will be the regular Axiom version? (CVS, I believe) 

patch-44 or patch-45 ? 
Would the aldor stuff make it?
if I send you a (documented) patch for the integration issue #199, would it
make it into the release?

I think we somehow need to manage to find a group that chooses axiom as it's
development platform. Otherwise axiom will stay what it is, and that's just not
good enough. I think your efforts with the Conference and the various efforts
by Bill are really great Contributions to this end. I'd like to say thank you
again!

I talked a little with Ralf about the petition to free Aldor. I'll set up a
page on MathAction to design an appropriate letter this weekend, I hope.

Subject: [AxiomDownload] Re: link broken

William,

I just tested and both of these links worked fine for me but they
were using the 'http:/xxx/yyy' type of url without an explicit machine
name. On some (weird old browsers) this type of link apparently doesn't
work. When I use FireFox 1.0.5 on Windows they work fine and I never
had trouble with Windows Explorer 6. What browser and version are you
using? What error message did you get?

Anyway, I changed the links to remove the 'http:' prefix which seems
to work better in some cases. Let me know if it works for you now.

Subject: axiom on Mac OSX

Tim:

With some help from my son, I have finally tried to compile axiom on
my Mac. I got to this far (see below):

I am using gcc 4.0 running under OS 10.4. The problem seems to be that MacOS
10.4 missing some library functions, such as sigaction, read, write, etc and
localtime, the last one finally is more than a warning.

Also, the shell has no command called notdir, used in setting

  SYS=$(notdir $(AXIOM))

which can be patched using

  SYS=MACOSX

I tried the FreeBSD localtime.c, but it does not compile (standalone) with many
compatibility errors.

Subject: Re: axiom on Mac OSX

Hi William,

since I'm using OS X myself I'd be much interested in an OS X
port. I've tried to compile Axiom on Panther a few weeks ago and it
didn't work either. Just like you I had (different) problems
concerning C library functions or header files. I've studied some of
the C code in some detail and I have the impression that almost all C
code is for the HyperDoc, Graphics or the management processes (axiom,
session manager etc). There seem to be only very few places
(sockio.lisp, cfuns.lisp, unlisp.lisp, hash.lisp) where AXIOMsys uses
C code. When I last looked at this code it didn't seem to have much
potential for compilation problems. Besides most of it could be
replaced by dummy functions (for example in
sockio.lisp.pamphlet). Compiling AXIOMsys would already allow using
most of Axiom's functionality (everything but HyperDoc and Graphics
pretty much) as well as the Emacs and Texmacs interfaces.

Subject: Re: axiom on Mac OSX

William,

Actually there is a MACOSX stanza in the Makefile.pamphlet file
which should be extracted by just setting your AXIOM shell variable to:

AXIOM=/Users/wyscc/mnt/MACOSX

The Mac port is only partially done. I don't have a mac so it makes it
hard to do the port. I'm working on the FreeBSD version which should
already work but I'm unable to get it running yet. It appears that I
don't have all of the tools properly installed and I'm struggling with
figuring out how to get the tool chain working. 

There is no such thing as a simple job.

I tried to "import" localtime() from FreeBSD library: wrap it in a pamphlet
file, modify the src/lib/Makefile.pamphlet to include this and do a make clean
at top level. However, the Makefile in src/lib created this error:

17 making /users/wyscc/axiom--main--1/src/lib
Makefile 12: *** commands commence before first target. Stop.
make[2]: *** [libdir] Error 2
make[1]: *** [srcsetup] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

I find modifying src/lib/Makefile.pamphlet (adding localtime.c.pamphlet) very
tedious -- I even put all the files in alphabetical order, resequence the echo
numbers, etc (see attached). Don't know why it didn't work. Perhaps Tim has some
tools to insert and delete c.pamphlet files without doing so manually, which is
error prone.

I already did that, and I also tried the FreeBSD version. I am also working with
the newest download (September 2005), but it makes no difference even if I use
the April 2005 version.

Can someone point out how to "dummy" out these, I believe non-existing under
MacOSX, files to force the compile to continue? or replacement files? (for a
start, some version of localtime.c that wct.c would like.  MACOSX must have some
equivalent time functions.

Subject: [Axiom-mail] Lexicographic order

Hi all,

Is there a smarter way than the following to write lexorder?(p,q) ?

lexorder?(p,q) ==
   if empty?(variables(p))
   then return ~empty(variables(q))
   else
     vars := members(difference( set(variables( secret1*p + secret2*q)),
                                 set([secret1, secret2])))
     a := members(degree( p::DMP(vars,?) ))
     b := members(degree( q::DMP(vars,?) ))
     return negative?( first(a) - first(b) )


My first attempt used:

   vars := sort(members(union(set(variables(p), variables(q)))))

but was surprised to see

  > sort([x,y,z])
  [z,y,x]

  > sort([x,z,y])
  [y,z,x]

and thus made up the secret-trick in order to avoid sort.

Not at all! I am still very enthusiastic to try to help anyone

others. Thank you for all your contributions.

I am sorry that it took me a little longer to find the source of
this problem. In this case it had nothing specifically to do with
your polymake code. Instead it turned out that the Site Error is
directly related to a recent email to axiom-developer.

In a recent thread with subject "steps towards better TeXmacs
interface" Andrey G. Grozin addressed the issue that the output
of Axiom is not well suited for processing as input to another
program such as TeXmacs. This is also a problem on the MathAction
website which must capture Axiom output and prepare it for
display on a web page.

The problem in this case is that the output of the SPAD compiler
is very verbose and quite messy. This output was causing the
MathAction parsing routines (based on some moderately complex
python regular expressions) to blow-up and abort the conversion
process.

In fact, I knew that this problem also occurred on some other
pages on MathAction. The most significant example was your code
for the 'Guess' routines. If saved as page type StructuredText+
LaTeX in order to trigger the Axiom SPAD compiler, that also
caused the Site Error and so previously it had to be saved as a
PlainText format page. The Site Error did not prevent the SPAD
compiler from running and compiling the code but it was impossible
to save the page unless the page type was changed to PlainText
because the Site Error aborts just prior to the save process.

The solution was also similar to that mentioned in the message by
Andrey: I had to insert additional markers in the Axiom output.
I did this using the following Axiom commands:

  )sys echo <SPAD>
  )sys cat code.spad
  )sys echo </SPAD>
  )co code.spad
    SPAD compiler output

to more simply delimit the SPAD code from the associated compiler
output. This allowed me to avoid the more complex output parsing.

The other thing that happened recently was that I upgraded the
version of Axiom on MathAction to Patch-44 plus Peter Broadbery's
patches to support Aldor. So now it is possible to write both
SPAD and Aldor library routines on MathAction. To distinguish
between SPAD and Aldor I introduced the follow two new
environments:

\begin{aldor}
  Aldor library code here
\end{aldor}

and

\begin{spad}
  SPAD library code here
\end{spad}

The older \begin{axiom} ... environment still exists and is
intended to be used only for Axiom interpreter commands. For the
time being the deprecated form:

\begin{axiom}
)abbrev ...
  SPAD library code here
\end{axiom}

still works but after everything that uses this form is converted
to form, this will be eliminated.

Only the new environment \begin{spad} ... produces the new
syntactic markers that permits SPAD compiler output to be handled
reliably. So this should be used for all new library code on
MathAction.

In your polymake page I have changed the delimiters to:

\begin{spad}
...
\end{spad}

and inserted your new code.

Now the page compiles and renders properly on MathAction.
I also did the same on you page named 'Guess' and now it
also is compiled and saved properly.

Let me know if you have any questions about this.

Subject: [Axiom-mail] Lexicographic order

Dear Jens,

Although I'm not 100% sure what lexorder? ought to do exactly, you might want
to notice the following:

the first matching type the interpreter finds for [x,y,z] is 

(13) -> [x,y,z]

   (13)  [x,y,z]
                                       Type: List OrderedVariableList [x,y,z]

which means that in sort([x,z,y]) you are using the order imposed by
OrderedVariableList [x,y,z], which is z < y < x.

So, although 

 >   > sort([x,y,z])
 >   [z,y,x]
 > 
 >   > sort([x,z,y])
 >   [y,z,x]

is surprising, it shouldn't be ;-) (<- please note the smiley !)

If you say

sort([x,z,y]::List Symbol), you will get the expected output.

I'm not totally sure how you can find out what ordering a domain uses. But very
likely, if its name doesn't contain something like "Ordered", it is the usual
lexicographic order.

Hope this helps,

Martin

Subject: re: axiom on Mac OSX

Martin,

I'm somewhat confused about the FreeBSD environment. 

The first issue is that FreeBSD outputs a 30 second LOUD beep before
it boots which I have not found a way to turn off. Does this happen
to you? How can I turn it off?

The second issue is that despite the fact that I asked for emacs to
be installed (I installed several times) I cannot find it anywhere.
How can I install emacs after the fact? 

Third, where can I find GNU make? Originally I had written the Makefiles
so they did not care which make was used but changes have been made which
require gnu make. I thought I asked for it to be installed but can't find
it. I also asked for the Linux-compat environment to be installed but 
that seems lost also. 

My only guess is that there is a disk volume somewhere that contains
all these packages but isn't getting mounted. 

All of my pure unix experience predates any package-handling mechanisms.

Where is a good FAQ location so I can get educated? I picked up a FreeBSD
book but it isn't really a user's guide.

In theory, given the work you've already done I should just have to compile
Axiom, make a few final tweaks to the Makefile, test the lot and we're
good to go. Unfortunately I'm still struggling with the mundane.

There is no such thing as a simple job.

Hmm. Sounds like something with the hardware. Check your BIOS settings
make sure your keyboard and VGA settings are OK. FreeBSD itself doesn't
beep at you during the boot.

If you let me know at which part of the boot process this happens, I can
try to hunt it down further.

All the third-party/optional software is installed in /usr/local
and /usr/X11R6, so make sure you have /usr/local/[s]bin and
/usr/X11R6/[sb]in in your path.

Also check out "man 7 hier" to see how the system is layed out.

Gnu make would be "gmake" in /usr/local/bin

Nope :-). just a path problem.

Steep curve at the beginning, but once you've sorted out the (not very
many) niggles, you'll find that *BSD is a very clean system (I hope!).

Part of my problem was that I had to polynomials, which might be belong
to polynomial rings over different variables. I am probably not going
to use lexorder?, I am just trying to get used to the Axiom way of
doing things. Fortunately it feels very Lispy to me (if it weren't for 
the fact that tail recursion wasn't supported, I'd had said Schemy).

Lexorder examines the difference of exponent vectors of the multivariate
polynomials p and q. If the leftmost non-zero entry is positive, then p>q.

lexorder?(p,q) ==
   if  empty?(variables(p))
   then return ~empty?(variables(q))
   else
     vars := sort(members(union(set(variables(p)),
                                set(variables(q))))::List Symbol)
     a := vector(members(degree( p::DMP(vars,?) )))
     b := vector(members(degree( q::DMP(vars,?) )))
     n := select( x +-> ~zero?(x), members(a-b))
     if empty?(n)
     then return false
     else return positive?(first(n))

For multivariate polynomial domains:

DMP  uses lexicographic order of variables
HDMP uses degree reverse lex
GDMP uses any order function you provide
SMP  uses order of the variable set (unmixed)
POLY same as SMP using order in Symbol

All are built-in. Please check Axiom book or hyperdoc for details.

Bill, Peter,

As a practical matter we can't expect axiom users to upgrade both make
and java just to build Axiom. I'm following the directions you put on
the AldorForAxiom page just to verify that I understand the process.

I need to rebuild the machinery so it works with any version of make
and doesn't require java. It's been a standing goal (so far achieved)
that you can build axiom on a reasonable linux distro by just typing
'make'. Virtually all of the distros I have distribute pre 3.8 makes
it seems.

And since it seems we can't distribute the aldor binaries with Axiom
the whole aldor install is going to require the user to fetch aldor
(probably into the zips directory) and then 
  make aldor

make 3.8 was released in 2002. I wonder why 3.79.x is still so
common?

Upgrading to make 3.8 seems to be as simple as download, configure,
make ...

Since Peter claims his java code is "simple" perhaps it is possible to
use GNU java (gcj). That is easily available on most linux distros.

Another possibility would be to use Peter's java program to create
a static list of dependencies which we can then just include in
the axiom build files.

Yes. In fact I am not 100% sure that it is Sun's JDK 1.5.x that is
required but I have verified that it works. Peter never said exactly
what java compiler he is using.

It would be nice if one could use the GNU gcj compiler. But my first
attempt to do that failed so I assumed he was talking about Sun's java.

Although this is not a nice way for Axiom to fail, two questions:

Hi Martin,

Yes - if tail recursion were supported, then the above would be
an infinite loop. I haven't got any complaints over the wording
of the error message.


If tail recursion is supported, the above will result in an infinite
loop.

A loose definition of a tail call is: If in the body of f, a call
to g is made in a position, where the result of the call, is to
be returned by f, then the call to g is a /tail call/.

In

  summa(n) ==
    if n=0
    then 0
    else n + summa(n-1)

 > summa(10)
55

the call to summa is not a tail cail, since the result of calling
summa(n-1) needs to be added to n before a value can be returned.

On the other hand in:

  -- a stands for accumulator
  summa2(n, a) ==
    if n=0
    then a
    else summa2(n-1, n+a)

 > summa(10,0)
55

the result of calling summa2(n-1,n+a) is returned immediately
as the result of summa2(n,a) and is thus a tail call.


A call is /active/ if the function called hasn't returned yet.

Proper[1] tail recursion is supported, if an unbounded number
of active tail calls only use a bounded amount of stack space.

In Scheme a call summa(10000) would cause a stack overflow, just
as in Axiom, but a call summa2(10000,0) would work withput any
problems. However, in some Scheme implementations one can
turn the stack history on and off - so perhaps there is
magic switch somewhere?

See
<http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-6.html#%_=
sec_3.5>
for a more formal definition.

[1] Here "Proper Tail Recursion" is a technical term, and doesn't
     mean "tail recursion done right".

For some time now I have been wanting to implement an interface
to Maxima in MathAction. I am not a Maxima user, although I have
installed it and played with it a little. I was hoping that someone
with more Maxima experience would come forward and offer to help
me to do this ... :)

Where would be the best place to look for a definition of these
parameterized markers in Maxima? What would you suggest as a
simple example of a program that parses Maxima output using these
markers?

The problem of interfacing with MathAction is not exactly the same
as in the case of TeXmacs. TeXmacs which starts a parallel external
session. It then sends commands, receives and formats output in a
synchronous manner while the user edits the document. In the case
of MathAction, the entire web page is edited in "text-mode" and is
only processed by an external program (such Axiom) once when the user
clicks 'Save' or 'Preview'. Since a web page consists of multiple
sections of alternating formatted text, LaTeX commands, and commands
to external programs, these sections must be collected in some
manner and then sent to the external program. The output of the
program must be parsed and separated into output sections that
correspond one-for-one with the specific input sections. Then during
the rendering of the page as HTML, MathAction replaces each of the
input sections with selected and possibly reformatted parts of the
output (e.g. LaTeX generated by Axiom).

In the case of both Axiom and Reduce I solved this problem by
constructing a .input file for each section and then running Axiom
(or Reduce) with a script that executes each .input file by a
series of )read commands. The output corresponding to each )read
command is automatically delimited by the Axiom (Reduce) prompt
sequence. So separating the output into sections is quite straight
forward. (But of course would be even easier if Axiom was specifically
designed to delimit the output in the way that Andrey suggests.)

The problem that I have with Maxima right now is that I do not
know how to run Maxima in this manner, i.e. in a "batch mode"
to process a series of input sections and then parse the output
into a series of corresponding output sections.

My preference would be to pass InterfaceStrings via one or more
environment variables. Reading environment variables in boot code
amounts simply to calling the corresponding lisp system function.

This is not a "strange requirement" since one of the goals of TeXmacs
is to retain more of the mathematical semantics then what "normal"
LaTeX allows. This is the same goal that the developers of OpenMath
had in mind.

I think that this is an excellent idea. A couple of years ago
When Tim Daly and I first discussed this, Tim provided some
notes on how the )set output commands were processed in Axiom.
If you are interested, I think I could probably find them in
the axiom-developer email archives.

I think a new file is better unless you find that there is a
large overlap in the source code, i.e. same set of helper
routines etc.

Since this is going to be specific to TeXmacs anyway, have
you considered using TeXmacs' scheme format instead of LaTeX?
This way you can avoid the complications of the TeXmacs LaTeX
conversion.

Tim described some of this in his emails of two years ago on
axiom-developer.

Specifically in setvars.boot.pamphlet it says:

This file contains both the {\bf boot} code and the {\bf Lisp}
code that is the result of the {\bf boot to lisp} translation.
We need to keep the translated code around so we can bootstrap
the system. In other words, we need this boot code translated
so we can build the boot translator.

{\bf NOTE WELL: IF YOU CHANGE THIS BOOT CODE YOU MUST
TRANSLATE THIS CODE TO LISP AND STORE THE RESULTING LISP
CODE BACK INTO THIS FILE.}

-------

Boot is a compiler. I presume that that lisp code that you need
to insert into this file can be generated just by compiling the
new boot code (the way it is done now in the part of the Axiom
Makefile that builds INTERPSYS. You should be able to capturing
the lisp output in the NRLIB directory. Is that right Tim?

I like your last idea best. I think it would be a mistake to spend
too much effort simply tweaking the LaTeX output to make the current
interface more robust. The idea of having a )set output mode that
generates semantically rich S-expression output is very appealing
not only for use in TeXmacs but also for the work that Kai Kaminski
is doing right now with the new AxiomUI. I think that many of the
hooks that might be necessary to do this in Axiom must already be
present in Axiom since this goal is very similar to to goal that
NAG had towards the end of the commercial development of Axiom to
produce OpenMath output.

After the current (rush) phase of the Summer of Code AxiomUI project
is over at the beginning of September, I hope that Kai will have
a chance to discuss here more of what he had in mind of AxiomUI in
this regard.

I think the example at:

http://www.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/SandBoxTailRecursion

shows that something more subtle is happening here than just
tail-recursion elimination (or not).

For one thing, the call to summa(1000000) did not fail with a
"Invocation history stack overflow" as Jens predicted above
but summa2(1000000,0) did fail.

The definition::

  summa(n) ==
    if n=0
    then 0
    else n + summa(n-1)

is apparently treated specially by Axiom as a "recurrence
relation" and so does not produce a stack overflow.

Similarly a stack overflow does occur in this simpler case:
\begin{axiom}
loop : INT -> INT
loop (n) == loop (n)
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
loop (1)
\end{axiom}

Now let's see what happens if we tell Axiom to compile the
function (see web page above):

\begin{axiom}
)set functions compile on
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
  -- a stands for accumulator
  summa3(n, a) ==
    if n=0
    then a
    else summa3(n-1, n+a)
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}
summa3(1000000,0)
\end{axiom}

Now this function returns a correct value without the stack
overflow. And similarly

\begin{axiom}
loop : INT -> INT
loop (n) == loop (n)
\end{axiom}

if called here with 'loop(1)' becomes an infinite loop.

So it seems that perhaps the tail recursion elimination only
works when the function is compiled unless it is recognized as
special case of a recurrence relation.

The message "Invocation history stack overflow" is actually generated
by gcl (gcl 2.6.6 is the lisp compiler used to build Axiom on =
MathAction).
Although the examples above seem to suggest that tail recursion
elimination is working as expected in the case where the Axiom =
interpreter
functions are compiled, a search of the web returned the following hits
which suggest that some previous versions of gcl may have had some =
problems
with tail recursion:

- https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?func=detailitem&item_id=788

- http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gcl-devel/2002-03/msg00032.html

- http://www.mail-archive.com/gcl-devel@gnu.org/msg00287.html

So maybe there is still a problem lurking out there?

Subject: )set functions compile on

Tim et al.,

There are some known problems in the current version of Axiom with
certain function definitions in the case of

)set functions compile off

which is the current default state. See

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/196SetFunctionsCompileOn

Of course we would like to know what causes this problem and to
fix it, but the work-a-round is simply to turn it on.

On page 241 (258 of 1105) the Axiom book says:

When a function is compilable, you have the choice of whether it
is compiled to Common Lisp and then interpreted by the Common Lisp
interpreter or then further compiled from Common Lisp to machine
code. The option is controlled via )set functions compile. Issue
)set functions compile on to compile all the way to machine code.
With the default setting )set functions compile off, Axiom has its
Common Lisp code interpreted because the overhead of further
compilation is larger than the run-time of most of the functions
our users have defined. You may find that selectively turning this
option on and off will give you the best performance in your
particular application. For example, if you are writing functions
for graphics applications where hundreds of points are being
computed, it is almost certainly true that you will get the best
performance by issuing )set functions compile on.

--------

With gcl on modern computer systems function compilation does
not seem to take any noticeable amount of time. Can you think
of any good reason why

)set functions compile on

should not be the default?

It does seem to work in cases, where the tail recursive call is
to the function itself.

I tried another tail recursive loop in the Octorber 2004 version:

)set functions compile on
foo : INT -> INT
bar : INT -> INT
foo (n) == bar (n)
bar (n) == foo (n)
foo (1)

and got a

   >> System error:
   Value stack overflow.

However, I am not sure the above is the correct way to define
two mutually recursive functions.

That depends on the Axiom interpreter/compiler. Since Common Lisp
doesn't guarantee proper tail recursion, it isn't an error that
tail recursive code can run out of stack space in GCL. Some
Common Lisp compilers make an effort to optimize som tail recursive
calls, but it is usually unsafe to rely on it.

The code from SICP (which uses Scheme) that Maguire is trying is
thus not supposed to work an all Common Lisp implementations.

I think that what you are writing is correct. With Axiom from the
most recent Patch-44 which used gcl-2.6.6 I tried:

(3) -> )set functions compile on
(3) -> foo : INT -> INT
                               Type: Void
(4) -> bar : INT -> INT
                               Type: Void
(5) -> foo (n) == bar (n)
                               Type: Void
(6) -> bar (n) == foo (n)
                               Type: Void
(7) -> foo (1)
   Compiling function bar with type Integer -> Integer

---------

This behaviour is odd. It should have returned either a result
or an error message. So I repeat the command.

(7) -> foo (1)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;foo;1;initial| is undefined.

---------

This time I get an error message but not the one I expected.
I don't know what this message means. (Axiom is busted ... )

Let's try a slightly more complicated mutual recursion:

(7) -> foo (n) == if n>0 then bar (n-1)+1 else 0
   Compiled code for foo has been cleared.
   Compiled code for bar has been cleared.
   1 old definition(s) deleted for function or rule foo
                                    Type: Void
(8) -> bar (n) == if n>0 then foo (n-1)+1 else 0
   1 old definition(s) deleted for function or rule bar
                                    Type: Void
(9) -> foo (1)
   Compiling function bar with type Integer -> Integer
   Compiling function foo with type Integer -> Integer

   (9)  1
                                    Type: PositiveInteger
(10) -> foo (100)

   (10)  100

Here is the error message which as you suggest implies that
Axiom/GCL did not recognize this as a case where tail recursion
can be eliminated.

Even this "proper" case is apparently not recognized:

(12) -> bar2 (n,a) == if n>0 then foo2 (n-1,n+a) else a
                                    Type: Void
(13) -> foo2 (n,a) == if n>0 then bar2 (n-1,n+a) else a
                                    Type: Void
 (14) -> foo2(1,0)
   Compiling function bar2 with type (Integer,Integer) -> Integer
   Compiling function foo2 with type (Integer,Integer) -> Integer

   (14)  1
                              Type: PositiveInteger
(15) -> foo2(100,0)

   (15)  5050
                              Type: PositiveInteger
(16) -> foo2(10000,0)

   (16)  50005000
                              Type: PositiveInteger
(17) -> foo2(1000000,0)

   >> System error:
   Value stack overflow.

--------

So I think your caution about tail recursion elimination not being
guaranteed is well taken.

I wonder when should expect a "Value stack overflow" instead of
an "Invocation history stack overflow"?

Thanks for your comments.

The following Aldor construct does not yet work in Axiom.

I just tried another example, which is in fact the reason why
I would love to have Aldor working. I did not expect it to work,
and it does not, but it works *almost*. The code is as follows:

\begin{aldor}
#include "axiom"

Test: with { f: (n: PositiveInteger) -> PrimeField(n) } 
   == add { f(n: PositiveInteger): PrimeField(n) == 
              10::Integer::PrimeField(n) }
\end{aldor}

Note that such a construction -- the resulting domain depending on
the function parameter -- is currently illegal in Axiom. In Aldor
it is fine.

I compiled it with Aldor as usual, and then loaded it into Axiom.
As signature I got the slightly unusual:
\begin{axiom}
)di op f
\end{axiom}

and trying it out I obtained:
\begin{axiom}
f(5)$Test
\end{axiom}

which is roughly what I expected. However, to my great surprise,
if you turn on the debugger (beforehand. You always have to start
a fresh axiom because of the error I told you about in my previous
message) with::

  )lisp (setq |$monitorNewWorld| t)

and thus trace::

  (1) -> f(1783)$Test

the final bit reads::

  protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)..IntegerMod 1783 wants

  goget stuffing slot 10 of PrimeField n

which clearly tells you, that the calculation is done alright, only the
signature interferes with success.

But, on the other hand, I think we should really track down the cause of the
frequent failures when working without )se fu co on

I suspect that this could lead to some insights about how the interpreter
differs from the compiler, and it should be a priority goal to make the
semantics of both the same.

I'm unable to do this, I'd like to stick to the algebra part of Axiom. But who

Thanks for the clarification. Quite true. So the goal really should read

"to make the semantics of all the same."

I'm aware of the fact that there are fundamental differences between 
interpreter / SPAD / Aldor which are not bugs. But I think, in order to make
Axiom interesting for more people, SPAD should go away (not #pile as an
alternative *syntax* though!) and the semantics of the interpreter should be as
close as possible to the semantics of the compiler.

First step: document interpreter and compiler.

Second step might be to incorporate the "extend" keyword of Aldor, and the
possibility to have dependent types usable (not yet definable, maybe) in Axiom.

Would it be a fitting *challenge* for comp.lang.lisp to devise a *simple*
compiler for the Aldor language as described in the Aldor User Guide? Maybe
with a price of 500$?

Agreed.

Be careful here not to confuse the reference to 'compile' in
')set function compile on' with the )compile command. In the first
case we are talking about the lisp compiler (i.e. compile lisp to
machine code). In the second case it refers to either the SPAD or
Aldor compilers, both of which compile high level library code to
lisp code and then automatically invoke the lisp compiler to
produce machine code.

For extraordinary debugging situations I believe that it is possible
to run Axiom without compiling the library code to machine code and
to let lisp interpret the generated lisp code directly. (Is that
right Tim?) But normally all library code is compiled twice, once
from SPAD/Aldor to lisp and then a second time from lisp to machine
code.

When ')set function compile off' is in effect, the interpreter
does not call the lisp compiler. Instead it allows lisp to simply
interpret the lisp code that it generates for function definitions.

In the case of the interpreter, in principle there should be no
differences in the semantics between compiling the lisp code or
not. Any difference would constitute a programming error either in
Axiom or in the lisp interpreter/compiler (GCL).

Of course in the case of the )compile command, there *are* significant
differences between the high level language accepted by the interpreter
and the language accepted by the library compiler (SPAD or Aldor). I
suspect that when you say: "make the semantics of both the same" you
have in mind this latter case?

??? Why would you want a compiler written in lisp for the Aldor
language when there already is an Aldor compiler written in C? I do
not see how it can possibly be "simple".

If you can find anyone willing to write another compiler for a
language like Aldor for $500 then I have a lot of other jobs
I would like them to do first! :)

Seriously. I don't understand your point of view here. Could you

There are (at least) two reasons:

* it is not too unlikely that Aldor will not become free software

* it is always a good thing to have several implementations of the *same*
  language. Mind that I'm not talking about dialects, it is important that the
  implementations strive to satisfy the *same* semantics. A good example is the
  variety of Ansi Common Lisp implementations around.

I suspect that it is *relatively* easy to write a *simple* compiler (i.e., no
optimizations etc.) for Aldor in Lisp.

Don't know what to say about this offhand.

But I do recommend that the )set functions compile on feature
automatically proclaim the function signature before compiling, i.e.
running the following in this case:

(proclaim '(ftype (function (t) t) foo))
(proclaim '(ftype (function (t) t) bar))

or even

(proclaim '(ftype (function (integer) integer) foo))
(proclaim '(ftype (function (integer) integer) bar))

Yes, currently we do not eliminate mutual tail recursive calls -- we
can only do this with special support from the C compiler such as
gcc.  When we do implement eventually, somehow axiom would have to
group these two functions into the same C file or otherwise instruct
GCL to do so, as this is a requirement of the GCC mutual tail
recursion elimination support.

If the calls pass arguments and return types via the list stack, such
as is the case when the functions are not proclaimed, or when running
in debugging mode, or (at present) when the function returns mutiple
values for example, one fills up the value stack as well as the
invocation history stack and it is undetermined which will fill first.
If all argument passing is done via the C stack, such as is the case
for proclaimed functions of simple argument and return types which are
compiled and debugging is off, then one will  either overrun the C
stack with a segfault or proceed forevever depending on whether GCL
has eliminated the recursion.  One can see explicitly what is going on
by examining the compiler notes.  I think Tim may be patching the GCL
source to eliminate these completely, but in 2.6.7 and later, there is
a simple switch:

compiler::*suppress-compiler-notes*

which can be set to achieve the same thing and give the user the
option to see them if needed.  Defaults to nil on 2.6.7 and t in 2.7.0
and higher.

Just wanted to confirm the basic gist of this thread -- GCL will
implement tail recursion when:

1) the call is to the function itself
2) the function is compiled
3) the argument list and return types are known and not variable
   (i.e. proclaimed)
4) one is not running in degugging mode (si::use-fast-links nil)

One thing I'd like to do is to extend this to optional arguments, and
perhaps multiple value returns.

As far as mutual recursion goes, this cannot be done in C without
special non-standard support from the C compiler.  Thankfully, GCL
prvides this.  I have a patch, not yet committed, which gets mutual
tail recursion elimination when

1) the above is satisfied
2) the two calls are in the same file
3) the two functions have exactly the same argument and return types.

As for the old example from SICP, it is true that lisp is not required
to eliminate this, but that's not really relevenat for GCL as we do
want to do tail recursion where possible.  On looking at it again, I
don't see why it is tail recursive at all, even if one grants mutual
tail recursion.  I'm probably just overlooking something.

Description:

 This type represents formal fractions - that is, pairs displayed as
 fractions with no simplification.

 If the elements of the pair have a type X which is an integral
 domain, a FFRAC X can be coerced to a FRAC X, provided that this
 is a valid type.  A FRAC X can always be coerced to a FFRAC X.
 If the type of the elements is a Field, a FFRAC X can be coerced
 to X.

 Formal fractions are used to return results from numerical methods
 which determine numerator and denominator separately, to enable
 users to inspect these components and recognise, for example,
 ratios of very small numbers as potentially indeterminate.

\begin{aldor}
#include "axiom.as"

FFRAC ==> FormalFraction ;
 
OF    ==> OutputForm ;
SC    ==> SetCategory ;
FRAC  ==> Fraction ;
ID    ==> IntegralDomain ;

FormalFraction(X : SC) : SC with {

-- Could generalise further to allow numerator and denominator to be of
-- different types, X and Y, both SCs.  "Left as an exercise."

  / : (X,X) -> % ;
++ / forms the formal quotient of two items.

  numer : % -> X ;
++ numer returns the numerator of a FormalFraction.

  denom : % -> X ;
++ denom returns the denominator of a FormalFraction.

  if X has ID then {
  
    coerce : % -> FRAC(X pretend ID) ;
++ coerce x converts a FormalFraction over an IntegralDomain to a
++ Fraction over that IntegralDomain.

    coerce : FRAC(X pretend ID) -> % ;
++ coerce converts a Fraction to a FormalFraction.

  }

  if X has Field then coerce : % -> (X pretend Field) ;

} == add {

  import from Record(num : X, den : X) ;
  
  Rep == Record(num : X, den : X) ; -- representation

  ((x : %) = (y : %)) : Boolean ==
    ((rep(x).num = rep(y).num) and (rep(x).den = rep(y).den)) ;

  ((n : X)/(d : X)) : % == per(record(n,d)) ;

  coerce(r : %) : OF == (rep(r).num :: OF) / (rep(r).den :: OF) ;

  numer(r : %) : X == rep(r).num ;

  denom(r : %) : X == rep(r).den ;

  if X has ID then {
 
    coerce(r : %) : FRAC(X pretend ID)
      == ((rep(r).num)/(rep(r).den)) @ (FRAC(X pretend ID)) ;

    coerce(x : FRAC(X pretend ID)) : % == x pretend % ;

Subject: [UI] Plot Support

Hi!

I have just uploaded a new version of AxiomUI to my homepage at
kaikaminski.gmxhome.de. It now supports two-dimensional plots. Some
options do not work, but there are a few examples in the README to
demonstrate what is possible.

I should mention that at the moment quite a bit of debugging output is
printed, which makes everything a lot slower than it usually is. Also
keep in mind that when you first plot something, all the necessary
libraries have to be loaded, which also takes some time.

To compile an Aldor function, for example this non-recursive method
to compute a factorial, in MathAction the Aldor code appears
between !\begin{aldor}![fact] ... \end{aldor} tags on the edit page.

The optional ![name] parameter is used to name the compiled library
file which can be used later on another page in a ')library' command.
