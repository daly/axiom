Tim,

Can you give me a quick "how to check in files" for dummies?
I found the documentation on Savannah and elsewere oddly
obscure.

On my system I have a copy of the original files at

  /home/wspage/projects/axiom

I also have a copy of the whole set of files at

  /home/wspage/project/axiom2

I made changes to files in axiom2 including overwriting the
src/share/algebra/* files. And then I built the new axiom
there.

Now:

  step 1 ??
  step 2 ??
  ...

Thanks.

Bill,

CVS is painful to figure out which is one reason why I haven't been
using it. However, I've taken the plunge. Here's the whole of what
I've learned:

I maintain a directory where I work (call this WORK)
  /home/axiomgnu/new
and a directory for CVS (call this GOLD)
  /axiom

When I want to export a set of changes I do the following steps:

0) MAKE SURE THE ~/.ssh/config FILE IS CORRECT:

    (you should only need to do this once. 
     you need to change the User= field)

Host *.gnu.org
  Protocol=1
  Compression=yes
  CompressionLevel=3
  User=axiom
  StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  PreferredAuthentications=publickey,password
  NumberOfPasswordPrompts=2


1) MAKE SURE THE SHELL VARIABLES ARE OK: 

    (normally set in .bashrc)

export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSROOT=:pserver:axiom@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/axiom
                        ^^^^^
                        change this to your id

2) MAKE SURE YOU'RE LOGGED IN:

    (i keep a session open all the time but it doesn't seem to care
     if you login again. i'm not sure what login does, actually)

cvs login

3) IF YOU WANT A FRESH COPY FOR THE FIRST TIME OR AT ANY TIME:

   (you only need to do this the first time but you can erase
    your whole axiom subtree and refresh it again doing this.
 
    note that i work as root so i can update /.  Most rational
    people are smarter than me and work as a regular user so
    you have to change the instructions for cd. But you knew that)

cd /
cvs co axiom


4) MAKE SURE THAT GOLD,	MY LOCAL CVS COPY, IS UP TO DATE:

    (i maintain an exact copy of the CVS repository and only make
     changes to it when i want to export the changes. that way i
     won't export my working tree by accident. my working tree is
     normally badly broken.

     The update command makes sure that you have all of the changes
     other people might have made and checked in. you have to merge
     your changes carefully so you don't step on other people's work.
     So be sure to run update BEFORE you copy files to GOLD)     

cd /axiom
cvs update

5) COPY THE CHANGED FILES FROM THE WORK TREE TO THE GOLD TREE:

    (This is an example for updating the *.daase files.
     You basically are changing your GOLD tree to reflect the
     way you want CVS to look once you check in all of the files.
     Since you want to check in your new daase files this will do it)

cp /home/axiomgnu/new/src/share/algebra/*.daase /axiom/src/share/algebra

6) IF A FILE IS NEW (e.g. src/interp/foo.lisp.pamphlet) THEN:

    (If you create a file you need to "put it under CVS control"
     CVS only cares about files you explicitly add or delete.
     If you make a new file and copy it to GOLD you need to do this.

     Don't do the "cvs add" in your WORK directory. The cvs add
     command updates the files in the CVS directory and you won't
     have them in your WORK directory. 

     Notice that you do the "cvs add" in the directory where the
     file was added (hence, the cd commands).

cd /axiom/src/interp
cvs add -m"some pithy comment" foo.lisp.pamphlet
cd /axiom

7) IF A FILE IS DELETED (e.g. src/interp/foo.lisp.pamphlet) THEN:

   (you have to delete the file from the GOLD directory BEFORE you
    do a "cvs remove". The "cvs remove" will update the files in
    the CVS directory

     Notice that you do the "cvs remove" in the directory where the
     file was deleted (hence, the cd commands).

cd /axiom/src/interp
rm foo.lisp.pamphlet
cvs remove foo.lisp.pamphlet
cd /axiom

8) IF A DIRECTORY IS NEW (e.g. foodir) THEN:

    (this will put "foodir" under CVS control. It will also create
     foodir/CVS as a directory with a bunch of control files in the
     foodir/CVS directory. Don't mess with the control files.

    (there are a bunch of special rules about directories.
     empty directories are not downloaded by update.)

    (NOTE: THERE IS NO WAY TO DELETE A DIRECTORY)

cd /axiom/src
mkdir foodir
cvs add -m "pithy comment" foodir
cd /axiom

9) edit CHANGELOG:

   (The CHANGELOG is there so we have some clue what changed.
    CVS also keeps track of this but I haven't figured out the
    details yet so the CHANGELOG is a manual file for the moment

    CHANGELOG is already under CVS control so it will get uploaded
    when you do the checkin.)

cd /axiom
emacs -nw CHANGELOG
 (add a date, initials, and pithy comment, save it, and exit)

9) CHECK IN THE CHANGES

   (This will actually change the savannah CVS repository.

    The "cvs ci" command will recurse thru all of the lower
    subdirectories and look for changed files. It will change
    the host versions of those files to agree with your copy.
    If somebody else has changed a file while you were busy
    screwing around then the checkin MAY complain (if it can't
    merge the changes)

cd /axiom
cvs ci -m"pithy comment"

Congrats. You've now done your first real damage to the production
image. Please be very careful as this is a world-readable copy and
we don't want to ship nonsense. Test EVERYTHING, no matter how trivial
the change, BEFORE you upload. But I didn't need to tell you that :-)

I think the only interesting Aldor files apart from interval.as are for
producing Open Inventor geometry files, and whether you need them or not
depends on what your plans for graphics are.

Not necessarily because the Aldor compiler generates Lisp code which is
then incorporated into a running Axiom in the usual way.  The
alternative would be to use dynamic linking to link an Aldor shared
library into a running Axiom, which might well give the kind of
improvements that you suggest.  However to do this efficiently you might
need to tweak the two garbage collectors (Axiom's and Aldor's) to work
together, so that you could handle e.g. an Aldor list of Axiom objects.
There is some work being done on this at ORCCA, except that the "host
system" is Maple not Axiom.

The new Aldor libraries aren't really drop-in replacaments for the Axiom
ones, and are designed with particular purposes in mind (namely
Polynomial arithmetic and ODE solving).  There is a fundamental
difference between Aldor and Axiom which is that the former allows for
post-facto extensions of constructors, and that effects the design of
the libraries.  In Axiom you have to try to design the final version of
anything because once implemented it is set in stone, while in Aldor you
can always add new exports as required.  So I suspect that you might
find that the existing Aldor libraries are missing things which Axiom
re;ies on.

Its possible but non-trivial.  We had a long-term goal of re-writing
parts of Axiom so that it could act as an interactive front-end to Aldor
libraries.  It turned out that to build an empty Axiom interpreter was
quite hard since there were lots of hidden dependencies on algebra code.
However I don't think any of the problems would have been
insurmountable.

This is all my fault since I wrote that code :-)  We had a long-standing
bug that Axiom couldn't integrate expressions with floating point
coefficients and this code fixed that.

*,

The databases are built from the .KAF files in the .NRLIB directories.
(.KAF files are random access files).

INTERP.EXPOSED is a file that names all of the CDPs (Category, Domain,
and Packages) and classifies them. Only some CDPs are exposed because
most are used to implement algebra and are not intended to be user level
functions. Exposing all of the functions causes much ambiguity.

There is a function called libcheck (see src/interp/util.lisp.pamphlet)
that will check NRLIBs vs INTERP.EXPOSED. This is only partially 
functional as I see that changes were made to the system which broke
this function.

The libcheck function requires an absolute pathname to the int directory
so call it thus:

--> )lisp (libcheck "/axiom/int/algebra")

The main reason this function is broken is that the system now gets
exposure information from src/algebra/exposed.lsp.pamphlet. It appears
that INTERP.EXPOSED.pamphlet is no longer used (although I made sure
that both files have the same information). I'm going to modify libcheck
to use exposed.lsp in the future and eliminate all references in the
system to INTERP.EXPOSED.

For the moment, however, the libcheck function is quite useful.
It used to be run during system build because I frequently ran into
database problems and this function would alert me to that fact.
I'll add it back into the Makefile once I elide INTERP.EXPOSED.

DHMATRIX is the domain I've chosen to use as my pamphlet example.
I'll be making most of the experimental changes in that domain.
I thought it built properly. I'll check into the problem.

No, I think it will probably build ok.=20
It does not have lines like
<<package DHMATRIX ...>>=3D
so my script to extract dependency information
does not work.

Tim,

Yes, I understand about "tagging" and versions in CVS (I think).
The reason I uploaded the this as a patch was because your earlier
email implied that you might not want to eliminate those files
because you use/used? them for testing. So I thought if someone
really wanted it, they could download it and apply it to
algebra/Makefile.pamphlet themselves.

But after uploading the file to the patches section on Savannah
(were originally I also saw several other initial patches dating
back several months), I received a message from Babar saying
that he had "closed" (what does that mean?) the patch because
it did not seem to be related to Savannah. But I thought I was
submitting it for Axiom, not the Savannah system itself. (See
attached email below.) So I tried again this morning to upload
it to the right place.

-----

Thank you very much for the CVS tutorial. Do you know that I
could not find any documentation about "checkin" anywhere
in the CVS help files. I saw ci but it was in the context of
"importing" which didn't sound right. I can't believe how
bad the documentation of CVS really is... Your notes were
very clear. I think we should make them available for
download on the Axiom developer web page and we should
expand it as we learn and use more features of CVS.

-----

About uploading and managing files in the "files section.
The basic information is at

https://savannah.gnu.org/faq/?group_id=11&question=How_do_I_add_files_in_the_download_area.txt

but there is an error in the example. It says:

  For example, using rsync:
  cd /opt/myproject/download
  scp -1 myfile developername@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/myproject

but the example is using scp not rsync! It is possible to use scp
but I found it rather awkward and furthermore you can't use scp
to delete files. rsyn is much better.

rsync is rather like a simplified CVS. What it does is to keep
two directories, usually one remote and one local, in "sync" i.e.
it copies files from the "source" directory to the "target"
directory (and sub-directories if you say so) in an attempt to
make them the same with a mimimum amount of data transfer.

rsync access to Savannah uses the same secure ssh protocol as
developer access to the CVS. You cat add

  export RSYNC_RSH=ssh

to .bashrc or you can specify --rsh=ssh on the command line.

I setup a directory called uploads to hold the things I want
to upload (or download) from the Savannah files section.
Then

1) rsync --rsh=ssh --recursive
billpage1@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom ~/uploads

will copy all the files from Savannah to your uploads directory.
Of course use your own user name instead of billpage1.

2) rsync --rsh=ssh --recursive ~/uploads
billpage1@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom

will transfer from your uploads directory to the axiom files
directory on Savannah.

The naming of the directories and files in the upload directory
is very important because Savannah expects a particular naming
scheme to make things appear on the file list. For example, the
file that I uploaded has the following name

  ~/uploads/axiom/algebra_depends.pkg/1.0.0/algebra_depends-1.0.0.tar.gz

On the Savannah file list it appears with the heading

  algebra_depends

and sub-heading

  1.0.0

(Don't forget the .pkg in the first subdirectory!) If you don't use
this naming convention, the files are still uploaded but they may
not appear in the list.

To delete files:

3) First make sure you have an up to date copy of all the
files in the Axiom file section in your *local* uploads
directory, including the file(s) you want to delete. If
necessary use step 1) above

4) Then delete selected files (and/or directorys) from your
local uploads directory.

5) Finally use a command like step 2) except include the
--delete option

   rsync --rsh=ssh --recursive --delete ~/uploads
billpage1@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom

rsync has lots of options. Some you might want to use are

  -z  to tell rsync to use compression (saves time on a slow
      network link)
  -v  verbose mode for more information about what is going
      on

------

If the above instructions work for you, then maybe they should
also be added to the Axiom developer main page (or elsewhere)

I hope this helps.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Tim,

I have inserted a few notes below about my experiences with
CVS so far.

This format of config file didn't work for me. I have
been using just

  Protocol 1

And this seems to work provided I specify any other
necessary options on the command line. I suppose this
sort of format might be necessary if you use different
protocols for different machines etc. Should there be
tabs before each indented line?

It does not seem to be necessary for me to log in when I
am using the ssh protocol. Am I missing something?

IMPORTANT

  Check-in seems to take a VERY long time on a slow network
link. (Lots to transfer I suppose.) I am using the command

  cvs ci -m "comments" src/share/algebra

so that (presumably) only what I want to upload will be
transferred.

Well, not so important, I guess since cvs only transfers
things that have changed...

  src/share/algebra

contains about 16 Mb. of stuff (which is about 4 Mbytes
compressed) That will take a while on a 28.8 modem. I have
very slow upload but pretty fast download (via satellite)...

It is taking so long that I wonder if the compress option in
the .ssh/config file really does compression? I will try
again with the cvs -z option.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Bill,

I got the *.daase files. Thanks.

re: cvs for developers

There is a pamphlet I started called src/doc/DeveloperNotes which
is intended to keep track of the various things a developer might
find useful. It is just a collection of emails that I've sent about
various random subjects. I'll add the CVS information there.

re: compression

the cvs command will accept -z3 (right after the "cvs" and before 
the command thus: (also works on ci, etc).

cvs -z3 update

This specifies "level 3" compression, a balance between time and bandwidth.

re: checkin

checkin is painfully slow. it took me 15 hours to checkin the original axiom
sources so I feel your pain :-) I presume checkin has to do "transactions"
so it needs to do a lot of back-and-forth traffic. I'm not sure why they
don't use rdiff under the covers but it is always easier to criticize
than to implement :-)

I used just -z on the check-in and it seemed to speed it up
considerably. Apparently the default gzip compression level
these days is -6 (the highest) since cpu is now so much cheaper
than network bandwidth. I was actually surprized that it was
faster since already CompressionLevel=3 in the .ssh/config
file is supposed to apply at least level -3 gzip compression
anyway and the -z in the cvs command would seem to implie a
double compression (usually not a good idea).

----

Running rsync at Savannah I noticed a directory in upload/axiom
called stable containing a file called axiom...tgz. but because
of the time my cvs transaction was taking I interrupted the
download. Is this work in progress? Did you notice my "warning"
about the Savannah file list naming conventions in my previous
message? It took me a while to get things straight when I first
added something to the file section and on reading the
Savannah forum messages I found that this was a very common
question.

BTW, I am glad you did not ask me to upload my current mnt
version of Axiom from here at home (due to my apparent
upload limitations) but I coult do so from my office at work
where there is a T3 connection when or if you ever want.

-----

Finally, what are you plans for including the last 29 as
yet uncompiled modules?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Bill,

I'll move to -z6. 

don't know about the axiom...tgz file. I tried to upload a compressed tar
of the sources but the connection died. That's probably why.

I plan to build a new version with the *.daase files (probably tomorrow)
and then upload a tgz of the mnt directory. The mnt directory should
never come under CVS control. Camm and I need to coordinate building 
an apt and an rpm package. 

Give me a tutorial on how you got files into the file download area.

Tim,

Ok, I have got rid of the stable/axiom ... tgz directory and
file. The file was about 44 Mbytes in size. How large is the
actual tgz for Axiom mnt? And I also uploaded another file
in my "depends" set of Perl scripts to produce an input file
for vcg.

About uploading and managing files. This is from a message that
I sent earlier today but which seems to have gone off into the
blue. I have made a couple insertions to give you exactly the
rsync commands that I just tested online. As I said,getting the
naming just right can be a little tricky so it is best to have
examples that actually worked.

The command above is slightly wrong. It results in uploading
duplicate files into a sub-directory called 'axiom' into
savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom. Not good!

Actually the correct command is

$ cd ~/uploads/axiom
$ rsync -z -v --rsh=ssh --recursive . billpage1@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom

Notice the cd command to the source directory and the use of
. (dot) as the source name.

This transfers and/or updates all of the files and sub-directories
in the local ~/uploads/axiom to the right place on savannah.

Again I made a little mistake in the naming. The right
command is

$ cd ~/uploads/axiom
$ rsync -z -v --rsh=ssh --recursive --delete . billpage1@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom

Gentlemen,

Firstly let me say that you are doing a great job.

I downloaded the alpha version from Savannah and tried to install it on
my laptop. (I'm running windows XP. I use Vmware to run a redhat client.
Don't ask why :-))

My first error was to root everything at /SPAD. There are a number of
places in the code (and makefiles) where the file names are downshifted.
Thus the compile could not find "/spad/...". The cure was to make sure
the full pathname for the root directory did not contain upshifted
characters. E.g. /axiom or /home/kah/axiom. I think the one that got me
was in lsp/ccl/src/boot/Makefile  
           "DEPS = (load (string-downcase (quote ${IN}/npextras.lisp))".
OK it's part of GCL but it still burnt me.

My second error was to download the files to the windows host. I had
problems with a number of input files where there are files with the
same name (one upshifted and the other downshifted). EXPR.input.pamphlet
and expr.input.pamphlet for example. This will be a problem when you try
to compile on windows.

My last comment is that I tried compiling as root. And crashed linux. 

Installing as myself was successful. It took nearly 4 hours - but it
worked.
Congratulations.

Hello,

The "[bug #4546] Certain spad files fail to compile" seems to work in
current CVS:

)clear all
)cd int/algebra
)co xpoly )con XPR

works properly.

Shall I consider the bug Closed?

Hello,

The ")lisp *yearweek*" command produces the following output:

Value = "Tuesday September 2, 2003 at 19:15:55 "

Is quite different from the expected output in the bug report:

 YYYYMMDDxxx where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day and
 xxx is a unique number identifying a build.

So I consider this bug still Open, right?

Yours,
d.

Hello,

The "[bug #4547] polynomials are parsed improperly" seems to have been
fixed:

)clear all
x+x*x

gives the proper result:
         2
   (1)  x  + x
                                                     Type: Polynomial Integer

Shall I consider the bug Closed?

Yours,
d.

Hello,

For "[bug #4565] log10 in GCL returns a bad value for log10(1000)", the
expression "[1000]" returns the correct result:
(6) -> [1000]

   (6)  [1000]
                                                   Type: List PositiveInteger

However, ")lisp (log10 1000)" still returns:
Value = 2.9999999999999996

Should we consider the Axiom bug Closed? I think so.

In case this is a gcl bug, we should report it to Camm & co.

Yours,
d.

I have compiled it and it seems to run (not tested it a lot however).

My system:
 GNU/Linux Debian Woody 3.0 - i686 (celeron)


Yours,

Hey, at least you're trying for purity :-)

Actually, I have Windows XP running at my elbow. It is one of the

Yeah, that code exists because DOS (remember DOS?) couldn't handle
dual case files. It's been a long time since I had it running on DOS.
I don't remember all of the places this affects but I'll find them.
I'll put this on the list as a bug and get it fixed. I thought I 
wrote it up in the docs but I guess not.

Ah. right. I'll fix that one also. Some systems CAN handle DuAl CaSe.
I was aware (but not paying attention to the fact ) that Windows
couldn't. Send M$ a bug report and maybe they'll fix it :-)
Except for the input files (which I haven't really spent much time
on except to box them up as pamphlets there shouldn't be any case 
issues. The input files will eventually be replaced by CATS (Computer
Algebra Test Suite).

Boffo job, mate! How did you manage to do that? I always work as root
and have only crashed systems where I did something deliberately wrong
(of which compiling Axiom doesn't qualify). Working as root raises
your purity level +5, strength +3, handsomeness +7, and likelihood
of getting flamed +15. I haven't actually crashed a system in years.

Great. Feedback is most welcome. Bitch loudly about what needs to
be fixed. No error is too small. We maintain high standards here.
We appreciate the effort you made to get it to run.

Once I figure out how to upload files to the file download area I'm
going to post a full executable version. I'm in the process of testing
it on various platforms. So far it appears to run on RedHat Linux 9,
Debian, and the vanilla Mandrake 9.1 install (but not compile due to a
missing XFree library. I have to find and add the rpm). I'm
downloading FreeBSD at the moment. When I'm done Axiom should run (and
build) on all the unixy systems.

I'm looking for contacts at all of the Linux distributions so we
can ship Axiom as part of Linux. That way everyone has the option
of having it on their desktop. That should save you hours of compiles.

It's a footrace (depending on what task ends first) whether the 0th
version of the CATS, the graphics, or the windows port is the next
major event.

Yes, it is a bug that they don't match.
I'd lean toward the "Tuesday ..." form but leave the
decision up to you.

Mac OS X has the same problem with file names (it treats all filenames case
insensitively), even though it keeps the case. In the same subdirectory, OS X
will overwrite say makefile with Makefile. One way to keep the case correctly is
to use tar. I used Virtual PC on the Mac, so the problem is similar to Keith's
running VMWare on Windows XP. By downloading a tar (or compressed tar) version
in the host OS, it can be imported (or mounted after tar -x) to the guest OS
with no loss of information.

One way to resolve this would be to separate the lower case and upper case files
in separate subdirectories in distribution. I noticed the same problem with
hyperdoc files in the NAG distribution.

With all the sources under cvs control we should consider
using cvs revision numbers for version management. Nevertheless
it is not clear, if using cvs revisions is sufficient.

Ok, so the documentation should be updated. I've updated the bug report
accordingly.

Hello,

Tim:

> download on the Axiom developer web page and we should
> expand it as we learn and use more features of CVS.

About the web site: Tim, do you plan to change the current Home Page on
CVS? For example, we could user docs, developer docs (like Bill's CVS
tutorial), screenshots, etc. It would be needed to put your current TODO
list in a sub-part of this web site.

I can add a sub-project on savannah with corresponding Tasks to remember
to do such things.

Yours,
d.

Hello,

I tried to reporduce [bug #4549] default extensions on )read is broken
but it Works For Me(tm).

What I have tried:

david@oops:~$ cat /tmp/to-load.input
)lisp (pprint "running to-load.input")

david@oops:~$ interpsys
[...]
(1) -> )cd /tmp
The current AXIOM default directory is /tmp/
(1) -> )read to-load
)lisp (pprint "running to-load.input")


"running to-load.input"
Value = NIL


So the "to-load.input" file seems to load correctly. Tim, do you still
see this bug? Have you a failing test case?

Yours,
d.

Just to keep a trace, I submited your issue as bug #5059:

I could add that we have also been bitten buy this bug with a friend on

Suggestions are essentially volunteering :-)

Clearly you see a good reason why we should change the website.
Change it any way you see fit (I believe you have permissions already).
Do a quality job.

Work has coughed up an iMac and I'm downloading the developer software.
(I can't believe they ship OSX without gcc). So we'll eventually have
a mac port of Axiom also. Looks like GCL is going to get some free porting
work :-)

In that case we'll just keep the case-insensitive form and
warn people not to use upper case names in the path. The
code within Axiom already deals with the case issue properly.

I guess we could enable or disable case based on platform.
I'll have to think about it.

Juergen,

CVS revision numbers are not sufficient. I've seen the version number
issue attacked a dozen ways. Perhaps we could use the Godel number 
generated by consing all of the sources into one number :-) The 
strongest scheme I ever saw was to tag ALL of the sources with every
change. Of course this generated tags at a furious rate. One whimsical
idea was to use "colored" fonts (each character extended with a 32 bit
color RRGGBBTT) and increment the color of changed code at each change.

I've leaned toward the *yearweek* scheme because it clearly gives a
"cutoff" date for sources and gives some meaningful idea of when and
if a change might be introduced. Plus it seems less arbitrary than
3.1.4.1.5.9 as a version number. 

In any case, it's just a number, albeit a case-sensitive one :-)

Hello Tim,

I have several issues with email currently. It appears that my french
ISP Wanadoo takes several hours or days to transfer emails. :(

To respond to several posts you have made on axiom-developer:

 - website: I wanted to know if you agree to change the website. I
   cannot guarantee to change it soon but I'll have a look at it as time
   permits

 - MacOS X porting: there has been a lot of improvments on GCL side for
   MacOS X recently. Look at gcl-devel mailing-list archive. Latest GCL
   on CVS (2.5.4 and later) should have improved MacOS X support.

 - ok for the cutoff date (*yearweek*). But I still believe that the
   date should depend on the _sources_ and not the compilation time. I
   have not checked in current CVS however I haven't any patch to
   propose.

 - regarding dependencies on Xlib.h: I think you should _not_ include in
   CVS the .rpm (or .deb or whatever) package. Or then you will fill
   savannah with Mandrake, SuSE, RedHat, Slackware, ... packages. The
   right fix is to tell in the doc the dependency on Xlib.h (this is
   already the case in the FAQ) and, for more easier compilation, tell
   needed packages on a given distribution (this is already the case for
   Debian in the FAQ).

 - we need to add a README in top level directory


I swear, next time, I'll be more constructive. :)


Yours,
d.

Greetings all!

Just a quick note to say that I've put together a preliminary
axiom.deb and uploaded it last night into unstable.  It will likely
take a few days before being approved, but after that point the
autobuilders should let us know how portable we are!  Doubtless many
changes will be needed to the package that now exists, so comments
most appreciated.

A few notes:

1) I made several changes to GCL.  At a users request, GCL is now
   following the linux release naming conventions -- x.y.z where y is
   *even* denotes stable releases, and y odd refers to development/cvs
   snapshot releases.  So the latest stable GCL we're working on is
   2.6.1, which can be obtained via CVS with the flag -r
   Version_2_6_1.  ftp.gnu.org is *still* down, so this isn't an
   "official" release.  Nevertheless, I've uploaded a 2.6.1 gcl deb to
   the unstable Debian distribution last night to see where we stand.
   So the sources/binary can also be retrieved from
   incoming.debian.org.

   Among the changes were modifications designed to enable axiom to be
   built with gcl installed externally.  This now works, at least for
   me, with the following two minor patches to the axiom source
   (currently in the Debian .diff:)

        More on (compiler::link ...) below.

2)  The current axiom .deb, also available at incoming.debian.org,
    basically consists of the mnt/linux and obj/linux trees copied
    wholesale (with a few minor exceptions), and a shell script
    wrapper called 'axiom' to set the path and execute interpsys.  I
    added a placeholder manpage to conform to Debian policy, but this
    brought to my attention the question of (user) documentation -- is
    there any?

3)  Unfortunately, there are still 5 Debian platforms on which GCL can
    not natively relocate objects (mips(el), alpha, ia64, hppa).  On
    these boxes, one must use (compiler::link...) to build images.
    This can also be used on the other platforms, but save-system is
    easier to use, and we hope to make it available everywhere in the
    future. 

    So if we want axiom on these machines, we need to add a little
    code following the example in the patch above at the image dumping
    point, i.e. bootsys, depsys, and interpsys.  The arguments to link
    are:
        a list of compiled lisp object file pathnames, preferably
            complete. 
        a pathname for the output image
        (optional) a string of lisp code to be run at the end of the
            normal lisp initialization.
        (optional) a string of non-lisp objects and libraries to be
            placed on the command line
        (optional) a flag indicating if the user module initialization
            code should be run (defaults to 't)

    Lisp modules used in this call must be compiled with the :system-p
    flag to compile file set to 't.  This is most easily done with
    (setq compiler::*default-system-p* t) before compiling.

    I can look into making some patches, but as these should be arch
    specific, I wanted to consult how this could best be done in
    axiom's build system.  I.e. axiom has no 'configure' script.

Take care,

Camm,

Axiom has a bunch of patches to GCL (documented in Makefile.pamphlet).
Are any of these addressed in 2.6.1?
Does the GCL CVS contain 2.6.1? I can download it and try a new build.

I'll bite. What does compiler::link do? What does :system-p mean?
Does this change the packages of the loaded files (which will create
havoc)?

The .deb package should ONLY contain mnt, NOT obj. The interpsys
image gets copied into mnt/linux/bin/axiom. This step is not yet
performed by the makefile but will be shortly. The whole design
of the Axiom src/int/obj/mnt partition is to ensure that only mnt
gets shipped. int and obj are pure caches and should never see the
light of day. Their only purpose is to minimize rebuild times.

Funny you should ask about documentation. I'm in the process of
rewriting the Axiom textbook. There is work to be done but I'll
release an alpha version as soon as I can.

I have a copy of Debian but have not yet installed it.
Let me know what needs to be fixed.

Good job on the debian package.

Tim

I believe all, or equivalent.  In any case, axiom cvs will build
against *externally* installed gcl-2.6.1 with the two axiom patches I
posted.

It does.  But if you want to stay away from CVS head, you can do

cvs co -r Version_2_6_1 -d gcl-2.6.1 gcl

> I'll bite. What does compiler::link do? What does :system-p mean?

(compiler::link...) uses the system linker, i.e. ld or gcc -o, to link
the lisp compiled .o files into the main executable, as opposed to
'fasloading' them.  :system-p indicates that the code is to be
considered part of the 'system', which basically means linkable in the
above manner.  The init routine is renamed uniquely from init_code to
init_<filename>, and cmpinclude.h is #included instead of being added
directly to the C source.  This should not affect any package
structure.  All that is really needed is a list of .o files in load
order that go into each ???sys image.

OK, will change.

Great!

Of course I highly recommend it!

Typically once this gets accepted we will see a flurry of bug reports
:-).  A good user base is very valuable.

Take care,

Camm,

I've already patched the output system to round (log10 1000).
The issue is still open because I need to remember to search
the sources for any other use of log10. I doubt we use it elsewhere
but I might as well do a quality job, yaknow?

p.s. it's unfair to call in the (language) lawyer :-)

Greetings!

Our lisp spec expert tells me that routines returning floating point
values like (log10...) are not required to return exact integers in
cases like these.  

What you want is something like this:

(defun logi (x y &aux i r) 
        (declare (longfloat x y r)) 
        (declare (fixnum i)) 
        (multiple-value-bind (i r) (round (log x y)) 
                i))

Camm,

Last night during the rebuild I noticed that GCL appears to have
some native support for sockets. At least one of the Axiom extensions
is to add socket support to GCL. Does GCL have sockets?

Great!  Aurelien has been making good progress, with a working maxima
build.  Discussion has been archived on the gcl devel list.

Take care,

Greg,

I'll check it out. Axiom is supposed to be pure ansi common lisp.
We'll get there someday if they stop changing the standard :-)

Actually gcl will not compile on FreeBSD. The FreeBSD support is much
too old (only a.out or coff support, not elf -- FreeBSD moved to elf
maybe
5 years ago). Mostly copying the linux setup should work, but I did
not succeed in getting a working system 'til know. So I stayed with
cmu cl (with the advantage of faster compiles).

Camm,

Yes, the comments are incorrect in two items: they use uppercase
in the path (which won't work) and it should reference Axiom
rather than interpsys. I'll work to change the makefile tonight.

What is the current status of the graphics?  Can we get it from

Greetings!  Yep -- an example can be found in the gcl source in the
gcl-tk subdir in the file tkl.lisp.  Check out tkconnect and
open-named-socket.  

Take care,

OK, I looked into making this change, but interpsys itself is in
obj/linux/bin.  Didn't you say in your release email:

=============================================================================
The executable is (currently) found by doing:

export PATH=/SPAD/obj/linux/bin:/SPAD/mnt/linux/bin:$PATH
interpsys

The build takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes on a 2Ghz/1Gb machine.
=============================================================================

Other items which might go into the Debian package at some point are
possible elisp files for emacs support if any, regression tests if
any, or a window manager menu entry if that makes sense.  

Can axiom be used with texmacs?  If so we could 'suggest' texmacs in
the axiom package.  

Some source packages of this size split the output tree into several
binary .deb packages.  For maxima, for example, there is maxima,
maxima-doc, maxima-emacs, maxima-share, maxima-src, maxima-test, and
xmaxima.  Don't know if that is appropriate here.  The only policy
item specified by the LSB is that arch specific stuff goes under
/usr/lib, while arch independent stuff goes under /usr/share.

Take care,

I've integrated your answer in the bug system.

Thank you for the report and explanation.

Juergen,

One reason I haven't tried CMUCL is that I don't know the equivalent
save-system command. Do you have a shell script or Makefile you can

Hello,

As well as bug #4554 (also on DAASE), I think "[bug #4555] export
DAASE=/home/axiomgnu/new/share; This needs to default to mnt/sys in
interpreter" is also fixed. Am I correct?

Bug details:

Email has been wierd lately. Axiom-developer posts show up 2 days late.
Or maybe I'm just a slow reader.

You have my permission to change the website as you see fit. We need
you to do a quality job and I'm sure the group will give you feedback
about what "quality" means.

I sent a note to Aurelien Chanudet <ralubrik@yahoo.fr> who is the
person doing the port to see where I should start.

I'm open to discussion about this. Do you know any method of getting
the current source release information (assuming we update the sources
at least once a day)? Can we do this automatically?

I agree. I'm working on the Mandrake port and have at least 8 packages
that need to be installed. I'll update the docs to explain this and
remove the rpm from Savannah.

Sigh. Yeah, I suppose we do. :-) I'll write something and put it
up on Savannah.

Criticism is constructive. Personal attacks are not.
So far everything I've heard from everyone is constructive.
Except for the moronic idiot leading this project you've
all done a great job :-)

Hello,

It seems to me that bugs "4557 LODO1 fails to bootstrap" and "4558 LODO2
fails to bootstrap" are now fixed. Right?

Greping int/algebra/, I hace seen that LODO1 is defined in lodo.spad
which is compiled correctly.

It seems also that LODO2 is used (so compiled?) correctly.

Shall I Close both bugs?

Yours,
d.

CVS proposes the $Date$ Keyword[1] that can be incorporated into a file
and that will be updated automatically on each commit of the file.

So we could have code like (excuse my common lisp):

-- In file yearweek.lsp.pamphlet --
(setq *yearweek* "$Date$")
-- eof --

The main issue is that the $Date$ Keyword is attached to the _file_ and
not the _whole source tree_. So if we modify for example a typo in
Makefile.pamphlet and commit the change, the *yearweek* variable would
not be changed.


Another solution would be to use CVS capabilities to execute scripts on
CVS commands[2]. We would thus attach a script to 'cvs commit' that
would put the commit date into the *yearweek* variable or check that a
mandatory policy is done (like updating the ChangeLog). I can't
elaborate more on this without digging first into CVS documentation. The
main issue with this approach is that we need to edit some files on
CVSROOT and put executable scripts on server; and I'm not sure if this
is possible on savannah.


Yours,
d.

Unfortunately it's not only the save system command=20
(extension::save-lisp file :init-function #'fn). There are
a few minor problems (cmu cl is a bit more picky about=20
functional arguments, pathname-type on direcories is nil
and some gcl specific functions do not exist. Integer
and characters are not type equivalent). I have addressed
these issues, but those changes are not separate from
other changes I made (comment out unused functions,
delete unused code paths). I can try to have a look
at the changes and separate the cmu cl ones from the
others.=20

Hi,

You might want to try the following steps to build GCL on Mac OS X. 
Note that this port is premature and that I haven't tested it with 
Axiom. Stratified garbage collection is not yet fully supported (need 
to retrieve the page fault address).

Please, keep me posted on how this goes !

1- Get the latest CVS release (2.7.0).

2- Assuming bash, configure your shell as follows :

ulimit -n 512

if [ -z "$LIBRARY_PATH" ]; then
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib
else
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/sw/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
fi
export LIBRARY_PATH

if [ -z "$C_INCLUDE_PATH" ]; then
     C_INCLUDE_PATH=/sw/include
else
     C_INCLUDE_PATH=/sw/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
fi
export C_INCLUDE_PATH

export CPPFLAGS="-no-cpp-precomp"

The /sw tricks are used to enable readline support (/sw is Fink's root).

3- Apply the following patches :

Hello,

Judging from my Axiom compilation log, I think "[bug #4554] export
DAASE=/home/axiomgnu/new/share" is fixed.

The DAASE global variable exists during build and points to the default
copy of the various .daase files which describe the algebra.

Right?

d.

I'm not sure which message you're replying to (since you neither keep
the Reply-To headers in your messages nor have you quoted sufficient
context) but the current behaviour is clearly wrong: it works on neither
case-sensitive nor case-insensitive platforms.  On case-sensitive
platforms, some paths are gratuitously downcased.  On case-insensitive
platforms, there are filename conflicts.  What reason is there ever to
downcase filenames?

Peace,

Camm,

The latest CVS change will create axiom in the mnt/linux/bin directory
instead of interpsys. There should be now be no reason why obj or int
are needed.

Dylan,

The graphics isn't uploaded anywhere. It is a C program that runs
as a process and communicates thru sockets. It requires another
process to manage the starting and stopping of the graphics.

I can try to partition it out and send you the files if you're
interested in hacking on it.

*,

I have a very long equation that I need to break up. I can't seem to get
LaTex to break a line in math mode. Clearly this is possible but every attempt
so far has failed. The equation reads:

\begin{displaymath}
\left(
{-{2 \  {b \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\log 
\left(
{{{{\root {3} \of {a}} \  {{\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}} \sp 2}}+{{{\root 
{3} \of {a}} \sp 2} \  {\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}}}+a}} 
\right)}}+
{4 \  {b \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\log 
\left(
{{{{{\root {3} \of {a}} \sp 2} \  {\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}}} -a}} 
\right)}}+{{12}
\  {b \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\arctan 
\left(
{{{{2 \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {{\root {3} \of {a}} \sp 2} \  {\root {3} \of {{{b \  
x}+a}}}}+{a \  {\sqrt {3}}}} \over {3 \  a}}} 
\right)}}+{{\left(
{{12} \  b \  x} -{9 \  a} 
\right)}
\  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\root {3} \of {a}} \  {{\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}} \sp 
2}}}
\right)
\over {{18} \  {a \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\root {3} \of 
{a}}} 
\end{displaymath}

Suggestions are welcome.

1. Cmu cl has native socket support as well.

2. Actually I think I had a version of scratchpad
on akcl a long time ago, where the additional objectfiles were
dynamically loaded into the lisp system. I am not sure, but
I think it was possible to save a lisp image which=20
contained the loaded object files. Using such a technique
would allow us to use a stock gcl distribution.

This is exactly what the makefile does. Axiom needs sockets to
communicate with the hypertex and graphics subsystems. The socket
code is compiled and added to the underlying lisp. However I noticed
that GCL appears to have socket code which was clearly added after
AKCL.

Thanks Tim!  Am rebuilding now, and will upload a new .deb if OK.

Tim,

An eqnarray or eqnarrry* environment is what you want (Lamport, 
_LaTeX_, 2d ed. p. 48.).
Use & to separate items in a line and \\ to break lines.

Andrey,

I tried re-arranging the equation by hand but clearly my skills
are lacking. I was not expecting automated equation breaking as
I know that's an unsolved problem.

The equation is automatically TeX formatted by Axiom.

Mea Culpa. I copied the wrong version of the final Makefile.pamphlet.
I broke the build. I'll fix it when I get home from work.
CVS doesn't seem to work from here.

Yes, I'm considering removing the sockio-c.o code in the future.
Most Common Lisps support sockets now although the support is
not standardized.

I think akcl and gcl has the ability to load and dynamically
link object files into a lisp image and save that later to
a file.

But as far as I understand, the AXIOM makefiles generate the
initial lisp executable with for example sockio-c.o linked in from all=20
the object files of the gcl system using the normal system linker.
That is, we have to compile gcl in the context of AXIOM and cannot=20
use a gcl package which is independent of AXIOM.

I think AXIOM should not change the case of filenames. The
filenames in the distribution should be choosen in a way,
that we do not get conflicts on platforms which do not
distinguish case. If needed (I doubt it) there should be
a function to compare filenames for equality which
obeys to the convention of the operating system. Maybe
there is even a function in the common lisp standard
doing that.

Right now the filenames are downcased in the=20
build process (build-interpsys), because the makefile
gives a lisp list of filenames to the lisp system
as SYMBOLS, not as STRINGS. Here case is lost. This=20
should be fixed. Just use $(patsubst %, "%", $(FILELIST))
in gnu make.

This is actually not the case given GCL's (compiler::link ...)
function.  Non-lisp compiled objects can be linked into a saved image
using the system linker (ld).  An example is given in the small patch
I posted, which enables axiom to be built with external GCL (>=2.6.1).

Take care,

To add to Gregory comment, you'll find additional tips for long
equations on following web page:

 http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hildebr/tex/displays.html

# How to break up long formulas. Breaking up overlong lines in displays
  can be very tricky, and requires a good knowledge of the underlying
  mathematics as well as a feel for good mathematical typesetting. For
  that reason, TeX doesn't break formulas, as it does with ordinary
  text. However, there are some general guidelines. Here are possible
  breaking points, in decreasing order of desirability:

    * Right before an equal sign or equivalent (e.g., a "less than"
      sign). In this case, place the alignment symbol (ampersand) placed
      before the equal sign, i.e., ... + x \\ &= . The equal signs (or
      equivalent) should be aligned.

    * Before a plus or minus sign. In that case, the continuation line
      should be shifted to the right by a \qquad. If the continuation
      line is very short, two \qquad's might be better.

    * Between two large "chunks" that are multiplied. The chunks could
      be large parenthesized expression, sums or integrals. This should
      be used only as a last resort, and in that case the preceding line
      should end with an explicit multiplication symbol (\times), the
      continuation line should begin with \times symbol and be shifted
      as far to the right (by preceding it with a few \qquad's after the
      alignment symbol).


Yours,
d.

Tim,

This problem sounds like a nice task for a student who wants to
learn dynamic programming. Find all off the legal line breaks in an
equation (after the obvious preprocessing, like converting x/y to 1/x * 
{y})
then combine them into bigger lines with a cost function that goes up 
with
the number of lines but down when the lines are balanced, i.e., almost 
the
same length.

IIRC, there are some related example (written in Haskell) in Bird's
_Algebra of Programming_.

Best Wishes,
Greg

The file has been corrected (and tested).
Sorry about that.
You should now be able to build the system using on mnt.

This is the Jenks-Sutor book, correct?  Will this also be released
under a free license?  How substantially has the language changed?  Is
it worth picking up a copy of the old version?

Peace,

to produce, say, PostScript files for graphics?

Peace,

Attached you find patch to get gcl-2.5.3 compiled on FreeBSD 5.1. With
this gcl image, I was able to compile the AXIOM sources.

Configure options are --enable-custreloc --disable-statsysbfd
--enable-machine=3DFreeBSD

I was not successful with the other link options.
I was able to compile the gcl with BFD or DLOPEN and generate
a saved_gcl, but I could not load cmpnew/collectfn.o. Maybe I
made a mistake.

Tim:
  
If you are not concerned with the general line break algorithm in TeX output in
Axiom, there are a number of ways to typeset the expression you gave, on several
lines.  One such is given below.

However, it in unreasonable to expect any TeX output (from Axiom or otherwise)
to include a line breaking algorithm. Even though I believe Axiom uses such an
algorithm in its text mode display of long expressions (as do Maple, and
Mathematica), this is made possible (and desirable) only because the programs
have the information on font metric and screen display dimensions. So in
principle, when the TeX expression is generated, the difficulty is not the
algorithm, but rather the parameters needed to run the algorithm because font
metric and display space or page dimensions are not available at the time.

So the logical place to use the algorithm is at TeX compile time. But LaTeX does
not perform line break analysis in math mode as far as I know -- or at best it
performs minimal analysis so that when not in display mode, it breaks an in-line
expression at places such as the equal sign of an equation expression, or the
comma within a list. In Lamport's user's guide, p. 50, he explicitly
states:"Breaking a single formula across lines in this way is visual formatting,
and I wish LaTeX could do it for you. However, doing it well requires more
intelligence than LaTeX has, and doing it poorly can make the formula hard to
understand, so you must do it yourself."

Unfortunately, manually editing these output is very problematical because of
the superfluous parentheses and extra/lack of spacings. Moreover, in order to
break the line, many left parentheses will be left dangling before the line
break, causing the TeX compiler to stop if the quiet flag is not set. In the
following, quiet (or batch mode) should be used. This is not a problem if the
goal is just some hardcopy or screen viewing, but may be a problem in some
automated systems.

\begin{eqnarray*}
&\displaystyle{{1
\over {{18} \  {a \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\sqrt {3}} \
{\root {3} \of {a}} }} \cdot
\biggl(
{-{2 \  {b \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\log
\left(
{{{{\root {3} \of {a}} \  {{\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}} \sp
2}}+{{{\root
{3} \of {a}} \sp 2} \  {\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}}}+a}}
\right)}}+&\\
&{4 \  {b \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\log
\left(
{{{{{\root {3} \of {a}} \sp 2} \  {\root {3} \of {{{b \  x}+a}}}} -a}}
\right)}}+&\\&{{12}
\  {b \sp 2} \  {x \sp 2} \  {\arctan
\left(
{{{{2 \  {\sqrt {3}} \  {{\root {3} \of {a}} \sp 2} \  {\root {3} \of
{{{b \
x}+a}}}}+{a \  {\sqrt {3}}}} \over {3 \  a}}}
\right)}}+&\\&{{\left(
{{12} \  b \  x} -{9 \  a}
\right)}
\  {\sqrt {3}} \  {\root {3} \of {a}} \  {{\root {3} \of {{{b \
x}+a}}} \sp
2}}}
\biggr)&}
\end{eqnarray*}

The Jenks-Sutor book is selling for about $20 on Amazon (used).
Give me a mailing address and I'll send you one. I have several.

Hi Tim,

Since the formula came from Axiom you could always try using Bob Sutor's
texbreak program (written to make sure that all the formulae in the
Axiom book fitted onto a page).  Its probably not as good as breaking
the expression by hand but a lot less work :-)  You should find it in
the src/htex directory.

Cheers, Mike.

Dylan,

All the sources for the Jenks & Sutor book are part of the original
tarball I sent to Tim, and are thus available under the BSD license.

Most of the book is still relevent although there we released some
errata to deal with minor language changes when 2.0 came out.  The list
of categories, domains etc. in the appendices will be quite out of date
by now as well.  

Cheers, Mike.

Hello,

There is also the package breqn.sty, whose aim is "automatic line breaking=
 
of displayed equations". It is still tagged as experimental.  It can be 
useful in some (many?) cases, and is used for example by imaxima.el of J. 
Harder, to display outputs of Maxima as images included in Emacs.

It would be interesting to test with your formula, maybe?

Best wishes,
Michel

Michel,

Actually I rebuilt Sutor's code and it works as advertised. 
If I get the time and still remember to do so I'll add it as
a function in the algebra so anyone can use it on the Axiom
TeX output. Axiom's TeX output uses a very old style of TeX.

Ah excellent ! If it works, that would be the best way, of course. Just by=
 
curiosity : is it optimized in the sense described by Gregory Wright, or 
does it only check that all formulas fit on a page of a given size (as 
explained by Mike Dewar), without worrying whether the number of lines is 
minimal ?

Best wishes,
Michel

It doesn't optimize anything as far as I can see. Sutor's quite
good at TeX stuff. Essentially it works by inserting \begin{array}
which is the hack I needed. You can try it on an example by:

1) start axiom
2) type: )set output tex on
3) type: integrate(1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)
4) cut the tex output starting with $$ and ending with $$
5) paste it into a buffer
6) replace the opening $$ with \[
7) replace the closing $$ with \]
8) save it into file foo
9) run texbreak <foo >foo.tex

The texbreak code is attached. It appears to be quite Axiom specific
and Axiom uses very old TeX syntax.

=========================================================================
/* Released under the Modified BSD license attached to Axiom sources.
 * TeX Display Math Mode Line Breaking Program
 *
 * Author: Robert S. Sutor
 *
 * Date:   1991
 *
 * Change History:
 *
 * 01/19/92   RSS   Change to use \[ \] instead of $$ $$
 *
 * 09/01/92   RSS   Format and fix =-.
 *
 * Operation:
 *
 * This program reads standard input and writes to standard output. Display math
 * mode starts with \[ at the beginning of a line and ends with \]. All lines
 * not in display math mode are simply printed on standard output.  The
 * expressions in display math mode are broken so that they fit on a page
 * better (line breaking).
 *
 * The array stuff is being converted to use the array node type.
 *
 * Restrictions:
 *
 * 1.  Assume \[ and \] start in column 1 and are the only things on the lines.
 *
 * 2.  Comments in display math mode are not preserved.
 *
 * 3. This is meant to deal with output from the AXIOM computer algebra system.
 * Unpredictable results may occur if used with hand-generated TeX code or
 * TeX code generated by other programs.

Greetings!  This is great to hear!  While I'm sure modifications are
required, a preliminary version if available and with the appropriate
disclaimers would be a great addition to the .deb package.  What form
is the doc in?

Take care,

Camm,

The new version of the book is in pamphlet format. I'm sure that comes
as a surprise :-). I'm working thru about a chapter a day. I've finished
the first 6 chapters and am continuing on pace. I've been rewriting 
sections that have changed material and have new material to add (but
I'll probably post a version before I work on the added material).
The whole thing should be available reasonably soon.

I'd be nice to get a contact at some place like O'Reilly to see if
we can get a paper version made. Does anybody know someone there?
Failing that perhaps a contact at Dover since they're known for 
publishing affordable books.

Thank you very much for the code. I misunderstood, I thought TeX 
linebreaks were generated by Axiom from its internal knowledge of the tree=
 
of the formula, not from an external program. I suppose Texbreak is an 
ancestor of Techexplorer? As far as I remember, Techexplorer was able to 
reformat formulas viewed in a web browser when changing the width of the 
window. So, some kind of optimization of linebreaks in TeX formulas seems 
to have been implemented in Techexplorer. Maybe Bob Sutor could provide a 
newer, optimized version of Texbreak for Axiom, extracted from 
Techexplorer perhaps ?

Best wishes,
Michel

Techexplorer was written after Axiom was sent to NAG. We were not
allowed to work on Axiom after it left the building and basically were
told to wander in circles around our chairs until we came up with some
other task.  Sutor eventually got into Windows development and wrote
something that was completely unrelated to Axiom, namely
Techexplorer. I believe that it was intended to be a plugin for
browsers. Of course, Techexplorer handles math and it is only natural
that one should choose a commercial math product such as, say, Axiom
for testing.  It is unlikely that he will provide a new algorithm
because (a) he's in management and (b) Techexplorer was spun off to
another company. I've never seen it run so I can't comment on what it does.

Jenks and Dooley did interactive books (a math book, natch), etc. 
I set off to invent rewriteable paper.

Greetings!  Just a heads up that the .deb file has just been accepted
into the Debian distribution.  Still have a bit or work to do on the
portability, but more on that later.  Axiom will likely ship with the
'sarge' release currently slated for December of this year.  Congrats! 

I also added a pointer in the manpage to the Jenks-Sutor book at
amazon.

Take care,

Hello Tim,

root <daly@idsi.net> writes:

> we can get a paper version made. 

If you publish it, it would be nice (and useful for Axiom fame) if you
can negotiate some kind of "Free Publication", i.e. anybody would be
able to reprint the book or modify it. From the previous email of Mike
Dewar, there is apparently no issue from the original authors (great!).
I know that O'Reilly has done that is the past (for a Linux book). I
don't know if they are still open to such idea.

Otherwise, we could envision to publish the book ourselves, by an Axiom
Fondation for example. It could provide some cash to sustain further
Axiom development, conference, dedicated web site, or journal. However I
don't know the risk or cost of such an option. 

Personally, I would be ready to pay some dollars or euros to have a
printed version.

You could ask to the ACL2 people, they are selling two ACL2 books (25$
each) that were previously sold by a classical editor.

Yours,
d.

Dr Paule,

I'm Tim Daly, lead developer of Axiom. Axiom has become available
as open source and I'm looking at future directions of algorithm
development. I understand from the article at:
www.ercim.org/publication/Ercim_News/enw50/paule.html
that Dr Schneider has a Ph.D. thesis on the subject. I'm interested
in making these algorithms available in Axiom. Can you give me a
recent email address for Dr. Schneider? Is his thesis available online?

Many thanks,
Tim Daly

Congratulations, and thank you for preparing the Debian package. The

Hi Guys,

The statement that "there is apparently no issue from the original
authors" is true but slightly misleading.  NAG owns the copyright on the
book, not the original authors (principally Dick Jenks and Bob Sutor
along with about a dozen other contributors including Tim and I), so the
original authors don't formally have any say in the matter.  Personally
I would hope that any revision would still be Jenks & Sutor (& Daly or
whoever) but I'm not sure whether that is morally or legally acceptable
without consulting them.  If there are plans to substantially revise the
book, whether as an electronic or print edition, I hope that somebody
will give this question some thought.

Cheers, Mike.

Hello,

For info, free Axiom has been seen on a french news site specialized on
free software :

 http://linuxfr.org/2003/09/13/13923.html
 Axiom outrag, Axiom martyris mais Axiom libr ! 

For those who wonder, the french title of the article is a parody of a
very well known (in france) sentence pronounced by Charles de Gaulle, an
also very well known french president.

The article speaks about the size of Axiom, both for libraries and
documentation. The author is also asking for a TeXmacs interface. The
soon to be realeased Axiom book would also help. I'll do another post on
linuxfr.org site at that time. :)

Yours,
d.

PS : Tim, we have a micro-community. What do you think about finishing
     your work on Axiom book (BTW, I'll try to give a strong look at
     it. I'm still a newbie in Spad) and then focusing our work to have
     a usable version (2.90 or whatever). With a first release
     (.tar.gz), we could build a wider community.

Greetings, and thanks!  I think this has been resolved in the latest
upload, -5.

I've discussed briefly before the compiler::link image building
option in GCL.  It is a hopefully temporary means to get GCL images
with compiled objects included on ia64, mips(el), hppa, and alpha.
Anyway, in the latest deb package release, I've included the following
mechanism to apply small patches against the Makefile.pamphlets to get
things to work.

Hopefully this can be made more transparent n the GCL end.  But I've
tested the compiler::link options on i386 and it works just fine
apparently.  I have one question -- the si::*system-directory* is
reset by the interpsys building process (somewhere in makeint.lsp I
think) -- is this necessary?  When setting the system-p compile flag
(required for compiler::link usage), the compiler needs to be able to
find the system include file cmpinclude.h in the h/ directory, which
is done conventially via reference to the si::*system-directory*
path.  The patch below sets it back to its original value.  Can this
pose a problem?

Lastly, it would be nice to turn off compiler::*default-system-p* in
the final image.  It is needed in the intermediary interpsys for
algebra compilation/linking purposes.  Don't know exactly where to put
(setq compiler::*default-system-p* nil).

Take care,

Mike,

As I undertand the book & authors issue it appears that the words
from the text have been released under the Modified BSD license
which allows anyone to use and modify them at will. However, as a
point of courtesy each of the dozen or so authors should be told.
I only have contact with a few of them as the rest seem to have 
fled into the woodwork. Did you maintain reasonably current email
addresses? I have no idea how to find some of these people.

Tim

It appears that you have not set the AXIOM variable to the correct

My reason for reporting the problem was that a packaged version of
Axiom should not rely on the user to set environment variables simply
in order for the software to run from its default installation
location.

Camm's latest package circumvents the problem by installing a shell
script (/usr/bin/axiom) which sets up the PATH and AXIOM environment
variables before calling the axiom executable.

An alternative, cleaner solution would be to enable the correct path
to be stored in the axiom executable during the build process.

The existing shell script could be improved slightly, for example by
setting the variables as follows:

export AXIOM=/usr/lib/axiom-0.0.0cvs/mnt/linux
export PATH=${AXIOM}/bin:$PATH

Hello,

I am in France (Paris) this week. [Oh how I hate what the keyboard
at this Internet Cafe does to my touch typing!!!!]

Anyway, there is already a Texmacs interface for Axiom that works
quite well - all that is needed is one small change to the C
program which is included with the standard Texmacs distribution
due to a difference in how the current open version of Axiom
starts up. The Texmacs program looks for two input prompts but
Axiom only provides one. I have a working version at home which
I can upload to Savannah when I get back (10 days).

How should this modification be distributed: by Axiom or by Texmacs?
Or should we plan to change Axiom so it works like the previous
commercial version? Tim said earlier that the difference had
something to do with "frames". Viv l'difference?? Tim, perhaps
you can explain?

Cheers,
Bill Page

Bill,

France, eh? Beware the heat. I was unable to send email from france
due to the keyboard, windows, and lack of emacs.  I spent the weekend
getting my ADSL up and running. I had to use a Windows XP box to do
the initial registration but it now runs under Linux just fine. (It
was really amusing because the windows box got a worm hit within 1
minute of coming online and I had to reinstall windows to recover). I
should be able to use CVS much more effectively now.

Axiom normally runs as a subprocess of "sman" (aka superman). The
axiom command actually starts sman which forks off clef (command line
editor facility (our version of GNU readline)), interpsys, hypertex,
graphics, etc. When that happens "Axiom" puts up a second prompt using
a new frame (frames are axiom namespaces). The dual prompt is actually
a bug that was never fixed and hardened into the final code.

TeXmacs is the proper place to put any fixes for running Axim as a 
subprocess. You might ask Joris if he agrees. If not we can "host"
the TeXmacs C code.

by Texmacs. Eventually, in the interim, we can keep a patch against
Texmacs somewhere (for example on the mailing list archive if the patch
is small enough).

We should change Axiom to suit our needs. And propose necessary changes
to other software if necessary. I don't see why Joris would not accept
such change in Texmacs.

Tim, what say ye?



1) 

When attempting to evaluate an expression such as "0.0 + sqrt(pi)",
Axiom loads a number of packages, then aborts with

I am using libc6 version 2.3.2-7 on an x86 running Linux kernel 2.5.60.

2)

Package: axiom
Version: 0.0.0cvs-4
Severity: wishlist

When programming in Axiom it is extremely useful to be able to access
at any time the sources of the mathematical libraries (and the
implementation of domains and categories). Therefore the axiom package
should install or at least recommend the installation of these library
sources.

Take care,
Frederic

It appears that COMBF (from combfunc.spad) is missing. It's a bug.
I'll figure it out and fix the CVS.

I don't have an address for Eric Marsden and Frederic has no
last name attached. Please send me email addresses for them.

As to the issue of having sources I believe they were part of the
package. They can get the .spad sources for COMBF and family by
typing:

cd (yourpath)/src/algebra
notangle combfunc.spad.pamphlet >combfunc.spad
axiom
-> )co combfunc.spad

Of course, this will not put the COMBF.o file in the right place
but should allow them to continue for the moment.

Dear all,

> I don't have an address for Eric Marsden and Frederic has no

  Frdric is Frdric Lehobey (me). The bug report is only about the
Debian axiom package (thanks Camm for your great job!) that does not
include by default the  .spad  files. Maybe should they find their
way (in the same time as the output of pamphlet files) into some
Debian axiom-doc package or could be related to some specific use of
the axiom-src package. All this is related to the Debian packaging.

  This could not yet work with the axiom_0.0.0cvs-4 Debian (only!)
package.

Thanks for all your successful work,

Greetings!  Gerhard, axiom has recently been released (preliminary
CVS), and a Debian package uploaded to unstable.  GCL is used to
compile the source for Debian.  As you may remember, you've helped me
in the past with getting mprotect working on s390 in order to enable
efficient garbage collection in gcl-compiled programs on this
platform.  And now, GCL compiles itself, maxima, and acl2 with full
optimization on s390 passing all tests.

With axiom, however, there is a gcc 3.3 bug which causes the build to
fail unless -O0 is used.  I've tried isolating it, but to no avail
thus far.  I'd hate to remove optimization across the board for GCL,
maxima and acl2 to work around this bug for axiom, but it may be worth
it if nothing else can be done.  Axiom is a very sophisticated
computer algebra system.  

Do you or others have interest in axiom for s390?  If so, would you or
one of your colleagues be willing to help me spot the gcc optimization
bug?  I have all the necessary files currently on trex.

Take care,

Greetings!  Does this ring a bell with anyone?  Is there a work
around (short of not stripping the binaries)?  

Take care,

BTW, you can follow shout you desire Debian bug reports on axiom at 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=axiom

Their addresses are
emarsden@laas.fr and frederic.lehobey@free.fr

(The latter as already posted here.)

Please forgive my original terse presentation.  Right now, the package
just clips off mnt/linux and installs a shell script wrapper
(basically).  Do you have a suggestion about which directories or
files might belong in a package wishing to install source of interest
to the typical user?

I'm not a mathematician as Frdric but I would say "int/algrebra/*.spad".

Great!  Please let me know if you need me to explain anything.  

Briefly, you can go into my gcl-2.6.1 tree, change the CFLAGS, O3FLAGS
and O2FLAGS, do a 'make clean' in the o lsp cmpnew and unixport dirs,
then do make in the base dir.  
export PATH=/home/camm/gcl-2.6.1/bin:$PATH, 
go into the axiom tree, fakeroot debian/rules clean and debian/rules
build.

You should see the failures with anything above -O0 shortly after
'depsys' is created.  The O3FLAGS and O2FLAGS govern the optimization
of GCL compiled lisp modules -- I did verify that simply setting these
to -O0 (as opposed to the GCL opt flags themselves) does not fix the
problem. 

Take care,

Tim,

I think the main thing is to inform Bob and Dick (the latter might be
difficult I suppose).  Of the others, I am still in touch with
Bronstein, Giani, Grabmeier, Trager, Watt and Williamson (and Daly of
course :-)).

Mike.

*,

MIT has a lot of courses online. In particular, it has a fair number
of math and science courses online. (http://ocw.mit.edu)

The discussion at work today (I'm at City College of NY) is a proposal
to develop a common-format targeted front-end to Axiom which would
match and support the MIT math and science online courses. Of course
we don't have the man-power or expertise to develop such a large range
of courses in-house. Nevertheless, I think the idea has a lot of merit
for the education community and, in particular, the Axiom community.

Clearly the MIT math courses are reasonable for implementation in
Axiom (for example, Strang's Linear Algebra). And the Linear Algebra
course is clearly the basis for the Mechanical Engineering
course. Both of these are probably well addressed by the 3 Ms
(Mathematica, Maple, Matlab).  I don't believe, however, that there is
a coordinated body of code for the range of available courses in any
of these systems although pieces exist for some of them.  Axiom is in
a "come from behind" position at the moment.

I believe that Axiom's new open source nature gives it a major
advantage over the 3Ms since both professors and students can read,
modify, and create new algebra which could be freely shared worldwide.
Since we're trying to get Axiom shipped with all of the available
operating systems (Linux, Windows, Macs, etc.) it will be available on
all university and student desktops worldwide. This will give Axiom a
common foothold in the education market.  A common front-end approach
would lower the learning curve for students so less class time would
be spent teaching students to use a computer algebra system.  A
connection to the online courseware would make it very useful.  And it
would give widely available tutorials for Axiom so everyone benefits.

Is it reasonable for an amorphous, worldwide community to try to do
coordinated development of software around a single MIT target? Would it
be reasonable to convince, or hope to convince, MIT to host the same
courses in multiple languages? Could we figure out a way to develop a
grant/subgrant structure that would attract developers for particular
courses? Is it possible that any granting organization would fund
developers worldwide? Is it politically possible within Universities
to expect that MIT's presentation of Linear Algebra would supercede
locally developed courses? If not, is it reasonable to design the
software to allow selective order of topic introduction? Can we design
courseware that would handle, say, the top 10 selling Linear Algebra
books? Will professors allow students to use Axiom on tests (my math
professors would not let us bring calculators to class, including my
Advanced Calculus class :-) ). Can we arrange the issues and try to
address each of them in some coordinated fashion?

It is clear that free and open source development can have as large
an impact on education as Linux has had on the operating system area
if we can build a community around the effort. One of the major issues
is that building software gets little or no academic credit and even
less grant funding. Perhaps a coordinated effort can change both of
these mindsets.

If you have a few minutes I'd like some feedback on this idea.
Please reply on the axiom-math@nongnu.org mailing list.

	Dear Axiom developpers,

  I think there is an issue for the future life of Axiom, which involves
  researchers in computer algebra. From some email exchanges with
  friends, I do not feel that the revival of Axiom as free software will
  motivate them to go back to Axiom.

  In the French commnunauty, which I know a bit, because I was involved
  during my PHD thesis, 10 years ago, many people got very involved with
  Axiom. Many wrote domains, packages etc... for implementing the
  algorithms they were introducing in their research work.

  But at his time, Axiom was a very closed software, and the French
  communauty was on its own, for documentation, help, contacting gurus,
  etc... Axiom also had its load of defaults~: a cumbersome system of
  categories, poor speed of code, compiler and interpreter bizareness,
  no way to use Unix pipes and redirection etc. Furthermore NAG did not
  show any clear sign about the future of Axiom. Even more, there was
  the promising A#/axiomxl/aldor project, with Basicmath, but it was
  immature, so the choice between Axiom and aldor was unclear.

  As a consequence many were confused and discouraged, and switched to
  other computer algebra systems, for instance Magma, which offers a
  large library and is very fast (although it does not offer the rich
  mechanism of Axiom for contructing domains and categories).

  Consequently, I think there must be a thinking about the state of
  Axiom, and clear signs concerning its future, beyond the point of
  making it publicly available. Will the compiler will be fixed ? Will
  it be documented ? Will compiled code be faster ? Will researchers in
  computer algebra be able to incorporate easily their software ? Will
  they be able to redesign the system of categories ? Will it be
  possible to link against efficient C code ? etc, etc...

  May be the benefits of the free software will show up, but, after
  discussion with friends, it will not be enough for switching back to
  Axiom.

  Kind regards, and felicitations for the work done. I have been able to
  download and compile all Axiom, and I am very glad for that.

Subject: Axiom and the scientific commnunauty]
Reply-to: daly@idsi.net
--text follows this line--
------- Start of forwarded message -------
Daniel,

Thanks for your note.

I have had both face-to-face and direct email discussions that the
issues you raise are real and need to be addressed. I'll try to give
you my current thinking on the subject.

>	Dear Axiom developpers,
>

I don't expect that Axiom will gain a great deal of use simply because
it is free. I have collected about 100 free "computer algebra" systems
which I distribute on my Rosetta CD collection. Free CA systems are
"a dime a dozen" quite literally. Indeed many of these systems were
built by researchers as part of their research work.

My experience shows that most of these free systems start with the insight
that math "types" and programming "types" are similar. Starting with this
idea it becomes clear that you can build a nice, clean system from scratch.
It takes about a semester to build up a full, general purpose, polynomial
manipulation library in C++ and, indeed, you find that the math and computer
types interact very well. Then the insight occurs that the library isn't
useful to anyone but the researcher so the second semester of work involves
writing a front-end interpreter on the library. Subsequent effort involves
trying to convince others that this could be a very useful system given
sufficient effort.

This is very seductive since it looks like great progress. It has several 
problems. 

First, a local problem is that the research work that is "reduced to 
practice" using a newly implemented system cannot be effectively used by
others (e.g. library systems rarely do simplification and almost never
document their algorithms).

Second, a local problem is that reduction to practice, that is, "programming"
is generally not "valorized". The research is recognized but the year or
two spent building a working system is either ignored or considered to
be of little worth during tenure discussions.

Third, a global problem is that the algorithmic work, while free, is
generally useless to others. Either the system is so specialized that
it only does one thing well which makes it into a single-purpose, once-only
use tool or it tries to be general purpose and has such a limited range of
algorithms that it quickly reaches a point of frustration for the user.
Thus the one great algorithm at the center of the system is buried and lost.

Fourth is the "rule of 3". It takes 1 unit of work to get something for
yourself. It takes 3x1 units of work to make is so your office neighbor
can use it. It takes 3x3x1 units of work so you can use it "in the 
department" and in courses. It takes 3x3x3x1 units of work to give it
to the world for free without support. It takes 3x3x3x3x1 units of work 
to make it into a commercial product with support, a hotline, lawyers, etc.
Most "computer algebra" systems stop at the 3x1 level as there is no
interesting new research work beyond the first unit and the 3x1 units
are expended as a matter of trying to get the work out to the world.

Building your research on top of Axiom or the 3Ms (Mathematica, Maple, 
Matlab) immediately gives you the benefit of the 81 units of work already 
done.

Systems like the 3Ms get purchased because they are general purpose
enough to do virtually anything and hold out the hope that research
done with these systems will be picked up and made useful to others.
However you tend to lose control of your work. If it is badly implemented
in the 3M world and has your name attached to it you have little choice
but to suffer the hit on your reputation. In a free system like Axiom
your reputation is yours to make or break.

Detailed discussions with researchers highlights another subtle fact.
The 3Ms are built on weak theory ground. Practically speaking this has
the effect of "limits of scale". You'll find that the more complex the
package you build the more difficult these systems become, for reasons
not related to your package. The difficulty is compounded if you need
to use other "non-core" packages. In some sense, these systems are like
Perl which is easy to use, fast to write, hard to scale to large projects,
and impossible to maintain (yes, I know this is a religious debate).

Axiom started out like any other home-grown system, called Scratchpad. 
However it was started at a time that major funding was available 
(computer algebra was considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence). 
It was heavily funded by both the U.S. government and IBM Research for about 
23 years. Many researchers came to visit, many people worked on the system, 
many algorithms were created in a broad range of areas. This is the
"dream realized" for the authors of the many free "library" systems.
Fortunately Axiom started out as a "theory" system and not a "library".
(See the footnote).

IBM ran into financial trouble and sold Scratchpad (as Axiom) to raise cash.
As a business decision this made sense but as a global decisions it was
pointless. Scratchpad is a great system for doing research work and had
the support and attention of about 400 researchers worldwide. If you're
going to do real math research Scratchpad was definitely the place to work.
It required at least a master's degree to learn but was easy to extend if
you understood the underlying math. Your work could be integrated and used
by the research community. As a "product" (Axiom) it had a very limited 
market with cash-poor clients who could not support Axiom as a commercial 
product. Axiom could never generate sufficient cash flow to cover the cost
of a development team in the commercial, closed source world. And open-source
generates no cash. So Axiom is the best place to do research and the worst
place to make money.

Scratchpad was "open source" before the term existed. People who asked me
(while I was at IBM) could get a free copy of the source code. Axiom
when it was released followed the standard commercial path of closed
source software. This depends on a staff of people to maintain, which
depends on a good cash flow, and clearly Axiom couldn't generate the
cash flow. So Axiom was cut off from the customers who made it useful
and could never survive in a closed source model.

Scratchpad was ported onto AKCL, a compiled, hand-optimized version of
common lisp specifically developed under contract. I worked closely
with Bill Schelter on several detailed features like second-compile
optimization of function calling, tail recursive optimizations, memory
management, etc. to make Scratchpad perform well. When Axiom became a
commercial product it was ported to run on CCL, a byte-code interpreted
partial common lisp. This solved the portability problem (AKCL was 
very hard to port as it compiles to optimized machine code) but 
basically broke Scratchpad. Function calling and garbage collection
optimizations disappeared. Axiom is now back to running on GCL, the
open-source version of AKCL. Camm, the GCL lead developer, is on the
Axiom maintainer list.

As to contacting gurus we on the scratchpad team were told to "circle
our chairs" until we came up with something other than computer algebra
to work on (they even brought in an industrial psych. to "reprogram" us
which I found to be a very painful experience both professionally and
emotionally). NAG was in a very difficult situation guru-wise as they
lost the help of the guys who wrote it.

Aldor has great promise but people insist on trying to build the world
"from scratch". It may be several years and several failed experiments
before it becomes clear that the "library" approach is flawed. In the
mean time Axiom and Aldor have committed to supporting cross-compiled
compatibility.

As to the other issues like "cumbersome categories", hey, it's now
open-source and I'm open to ways of improving it. Scratchpad/Axiom
evolved to the system it is now because hundreds of people worked on
it and improved it. Someone needs to "unify" the Axiom type tree with
the mathematics in a much more systematic way. This is about a whole
Ph.D-thesis level of effort. The benefits of such thesis work would
be enormous as it would clarify how to correctly build these systems.
Axiom's types grew with knowledge of the theory but without benefit
of the detailed analysis.

Now Axiom is back as open source. That is a necessary condition but not
sufficient. We need two things to survive. We need a community and we
need a funding model.

For signs about its future visit savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom and
click on the "homepage" link. There are long range plans to unify with
theorem proving (ACL2 or MetaPRL), group theory (GAP and Magnus), 
numerical work (Octave, etc). These are evolving as discussions proceed
and the webpage has not kept pace. In addition there is the CATS (computer
algebra test suite) effort to unify the test cases from the many systems
and put them on a better mathematical footing.

The documentation is in process. Virtually all of Axiom is now written
in a literate programming style and examples of literate programs which
combine a Ph.D thesis (Richard Paul's Robotics work) with a domain
(DHMATRIX) exist in the distribution. More work needs to be done both
on this domain and on recovering the research papers behind the other 
domains. I've contacted several researchers and gotten their permission
to use their research papers and integrate them into the documentation.
This work continues but it is tedious because I need to find the research
and secure the permissions.

In addition I'm rewriting the Axiom book as we speak. The current work
is rebuilding the book but the later steps involve much rewriting
as well as exploiting the power of Active DVI. The online book will
likely be the "next announcement" so documentation is being given a
priority.

Community can only occur if people feel there efforts will bring reward.
In most cases, especially open source, this involves recognition. This
is a particularly thorny problem as computer algebra systems tend to be
the child of mathematicians. Math departments seems to feel that the
reduction to practice of math theory is uninteresting. Until the cross
breeding of the Computer Science and the Mathematics department yields
a "Computational Mathematics" department I suspect the problem will
continue. In the long run, of course, this has to occur as some of the
mathematics can no longer be done without a computer and some of the
mathematics only exists BECAUSE computers exist.

Beyond University issues Axiom needs to build a wider community of
users who are not researchers. This involves reaching out to the teaching
community. It involves finding ways to make Axiom easier to use and reducing
the learning curve. It involves developing a focusing agenda for coordinating
and developing teaching materials for the sciences (see footnote2). The MIT
suggestion is motivated by the question of who is the Axiom community and
how to reach/motivate/support it.

As to the funding issue I believe that this will also be a struggle. I've
been mulling the idea of creating an Axiom company which would be chartered
to work with schools to construct grant requests and administer grants for
researchers. This is an outgrowth of the way Scratchpad worked during the
IBM days. Researchers would come and spend time on site writing new domains,
learning Axiom, and returning back to their schools. Unfortunately I'm not
sufficiently skilled at grant writing to figure out how to make this work.
The Axiom company wouldn't own anything and would only be a paper agency
with a grant number and financial tracking.

An alternative approach is to "side-effect" the grants. That is, encourage
and support researchers who are applying for grants that involve Axiom
(such as classroom development of courses) in their efforts. This is much
harder as the researcher has to decide to make it part of the grant.

Clearly I have no creative new ideas about how to get money. However
if you take the "30 year view" of computer algebra it is clear that
we need to build on the current systems rather than start from scratch.
For one thing there is already 30 years of funding investment in Axiom
which shows just how expensive it can be to develop a "real" system.
For another it is clear that no-one is going to support another 30
years of funding just to achieve the same level as Axiom has reached.

So either we expend a great deal of energy creating small, special purpose
library systems or we contribute to the larger systems like the 3Ms and
Axiom. I would argue that Axiom is better designed to scale to higher
mathematics and also better able to support the amplification of the
teaching and research work because of the "open source" effect (that is,
freely downloadable packages widely available with multiple authors 
as with Linux).

I don't expect people to switch back to Axiom because it is free. I 
hope they will switch back because it is better, both technically and
socially, than the alternatives.

In addition I believe that "Computational Mathematics" will eventually
arrive as a discipline in its own right just as the Computer Science
departments eventually arose. As an undergrad 35 years ago I had to 
convince my math profs to create courses in "computer science" as it
was "just a fad". We need to begin to collect the widespread
research (enshrined in libraries and journals) and use it to document
the algorithms. There needs to be a whole tower of computer algebra
theory that can be taught as a field of research combining work in 
math, computer science, complexity, types, simplification, etc.
There needs to be support work for the sciences that need computer algebra.

Switching to Axiom isn't really the point (pretend I never said that)
but Axiom provides a kernel for the field of developing theory. In 30 years
this will be perfectly obvious. Computer algebra both stimulates fields
of research and provides answers that can't be arrived at by any non-computer
means.

Anyway, that's my current thinking on the subject.
There is more to come as work on Axiom continues.

Footnote: My survey of the computer algebra field shows that systems can
be classified in one of three ways.

"Library systems" start out with the realization that math types and
computer types are similar. A C++ (usually but not always) library
gets created. An interpreter is grafted on top of the library. The
focus of these systems is "speed". 

"Engineering systems", like Mathematica, Maple, and Matlab, are systems
that try to get "an answer". They seem to ignore math types and sometimes
specialize in one general purpose programming type (e.g. lists). You can
recognize these systems because operations like subtracting two equal
matricies will yield the zero integer. They are general purpose, easy to
use, and hard to scale (i.e. build on the work of other non-core packages).

"Theory systems" like Axiom or Docon. These systems start with the math
types and build up a language based on them. The programming representations
are flexible. Subtracting two matricies yields the zero matrix. They are
general purpose, hard to learn, but scale very cleanly.


Footnote2: There is a game called Pontifex which simulates bridge building.
It includes a construction set. Bridges are built and simulated loads (such
as trains) are applied to the bridges. Learning occurs. See 
(http://www.bridgebuilder-game.com)

Axiom could be very useful when packaged with games of this type in a
classroom setting. Consider a mechanical engineering course where you
have software that can compute virtual work loads on beam members (which
are basically delta-displacements). You could explain the theory, show
how to compute loads of 2 and 3 dimensional lattices, how to apply them
to bridges, how to predict bridge successes and failures, and use the
game to build the simulated bridges. Game playing and mathematics in the
same course. 

You could do the same in other sciences such as biology. If you look
at the forces involved in protein folding you could create models
using Axiom, define the forces, and compute results. The challenge
would be to create a game that accurately simulates the models. Perhaps 
in chemistry you could model glue-binding forces for various types of 
glues (like post-it notes) and construct things with glue. Game playing 
is a fast growing (and profitable) field. We should bring games into the 
classroom along with the theory.

A correction on the footnote in the last reply...
I used the example of matrix subtraction and made the claim that
engineering systems would give an integer zero as the result.
This is not correct. The point of the incorrect example was 
that type information is not carried in these system.
Please ignore the example.

Hello

I was looking at axiom foolowing a news in a french linux news site, and
I first saw the "Dec 2, 2002" and was a litle bit scary that it was a
lost project.

I checkout the cvs try to build it( fail while building gcl but I have a
working version on my box so I will try to drop it instead), and then
see the mailing list who seem to be much more alive.

I have a lot of interest in this project as a student in computer
science, and I think to create a comunity its very important to have a
descent up-to-date web site, has its the main image and first source of
information.

IMHO wiki will be very well suited to such a project a least in the
first time because they are easy to use, easy to keep up-to-date and a
good cooperating medium.

You can have look at project like : http://twiki.org/ very powerfull,
the big gun http://tikiwiki.org/ and in php
http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/ but there are many more have a
look at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines

I will be glade to help if needed.

Antoine,

The Axiom project is very much alive and growing.  I'm not sure if we
can run a wiki from the free software foundation site.  And, yes, the
homepage is WAY out of date. David Mentre has web access to the
current page. He's copied on this note.

David,

Can you and Antoine cooperate on updating the webpage?

 In the 3M's, the difference of two equal matrices is the zero matrix. However,
a brief investigation seems to indicate that type information in Maple or
Mathematica is carried only to a limited extent, and not as formally or robustly
as in Axiom. Matlab has types (classes), apparently based on C++ or Java
constructs.

In Mathematica: Head[ ] does not always give types; and there are only a few
specific routines to test types.

In[1]:=
a := x^2 + 1

In[2]:=
b := x^2

In[3]:=
c := a - b

In[4]:=
PolynomialQ[c]

Out[4]=
True

In[5]:=
IntegerQ[c]

Out[5]=
True

In[6]:=
Head[c]

Out[6]=
Integer

Maple has a type function with two arguments to test the type of a variable, but
only if you already know what type to test against. Similar to Mathematica, the
difference of two similarly typed objects may have multiple other types and need
not have the type of the operands.

> a:=x^2+1;

                                   2
                             a := x  + 1

> b:=x^2;

                                     2
                               b := x

> c:=a-b;

                                  1

> type(c,integer);

                                 true

> type(c,polynom);

                                 true

> a:=1/2;
                               a := 1/2

> type(a,fraction);

                                 true

> b:=1/2;

                               b := 1/2

> c:=a-b;

                                c := 0

> type(c,fraction);

                                false

> type(c,integer);

                                 true




In Matlab, the type is called class and seems to be retained.
>> sym x
 
ans =
 
x
 
>> a = x^2 + 1
 
a =
 
x^2+1
 
>> b = x^2+1

 
b =
 
x^2
 
>> c = a-b
 
c =
 
1
 
>> class(c)

ans =

sym

Hello Daniel,

While Tim has sent a lengthy reply, I would like to add a few words.


Daniel AUGOT <Daniel.Augot@inria.fr> writes:

The (Aldor, A#, ...) compiler has never been released as free software.

> Will it be documented ?

Short answer: yes.

Long answer: Tim (and other people like me) believe that the long term
viability of Axiom relies on its internal documentation. So all Axiom
source code is available in a pamphlet form, which is essentially latex
+ source code. Currently, only the build process is documented.

For internal documentation, look for .dvi files in a compiled Axiom
tree.

For long term design, see for example:
http://mail.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-08/msg00071.html 

> Will compiled code be faster ?

I can't say. Right now, Axiom speed relies on GCL (Gnu Common Lisp)
speed. If you are thinking of a native Axiom compiler, i.e. from Spad to
assembly, it needs to be designed and implemented from scratch.

> Will researchers in computer algebra be able to incorporate easily
> their software ?

This is a goal. Tim wants people to be able to do a drag&drop of new
Axiom packages, with automatic dependency handling, automatic internal
and user documentation generation, etc.

> Will they be able to redesign the system of categories ?

I can't say.

> Will it be possible to link against efficient C code ?

Why not? Axiom's Spad compiles to common lisp which compiles to C. It
should be possible to insert some proper linking at the right stage with
foreign C code. Of course, obvious issues like interaction with lisp's
garbage collector should be handled correctly.

If this is a requirement, please fill a bug report as "feature request"
in Bug group on savannah web site, with the maximum information you can
provide: expected user interface, expected behavior, example of syntax,
expected interaction with Axiom typing, etc.

http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=addbug&group=axiom

<religious>
Contrary to what Tim thinks, I personally think that free software in
itself is enough to switch to Axiom (or any free CAS). Because the
future of any free software is in the hands of its users. If you want a
feature, do not wait for it, just design and implement it. You have the
right to do it. Axiom is a bit old on certain aspects but it has some
well designed grounds. 

The future of Axiom is in _your_ hands. If you want a certain feature,
code it or find a another colleague, friend, student, ... to do it. 

Free software is much more viable in the long term that any commercialy
supported and closed software. Of course, it remains to us to show that
Axiom will be there in 30 years. There's no such thing as a simple
job. ;) 
</religious>

Yours,
d.

Hello Antoine,

Antoine Hersen <antoine.hersen@aiesec.net> writes:

> I will be glade to help if needed.

And, as Tim said, we are glad to accept your help. :)

I have put a new basic web page on savannah. It should be online in less
than 6 hours (the delay is not mine but savannah).

 http://www.nongnu.org/axiom/

My english is very poor, so if you or anybody else see typos or other
missing part, just tell me.


This page provides you basic content so you won't start from scratch.
I'm sure you'll be able to put a much more fancy web site that the job I
have done.

The first thing that could be helpful would be a kind of menu. 



Regarding tools, as far as I know we can only put static web pages on
Savannah. So you are free to use any tool, as long at it is free
software and can generate static web pages. Of course, a standard tool,
easy to install and easy to use would be a plus. Defining what is
"standard" is left as an exercise to the reader. :)

I would consider it a big plus to follow W3C standard.


Regarding Wiki, I'm not very fond of it and, moreover, we can't put it
on savannah. But if you want to start a Axiom Wiki elsewhere, please
feel free. We will had a link to it.


If you have any question, please to not hesitate to ask, in english on
the mailing list or in french directly to me.

Yours,
david

I completly agree with that. Document, document, document. Eventually
this will atract people who may become gurus with the
interpreter/compiler, and who will improve it. 

I see that hyperdoc is missing. Wouldn't it be possible to ship it with
axiom. This kind of hypertex browser is ideal to cope with the huge
axiom mathematical library.

Ok I have notably found the DeveloperNotes.dvi, which seems quite
valubale.

Afterthoughts after my message. In fact I am big axiom fan, and the
first time I sat in front of a computer, it was for learning Scratchpad
II in front of a VM/CMS computer. My previous mail was to reflect the
septicism of some french researchers, after the failure of axiom from
NAG. This septicism is a bit mine, althought I heartly hope that axiom
will at last gain the communauty it merits. Thus the need for
documentation.

Daniel,

The hyperdoc section of Axiom is coming. Hyperdoc was written before
browsers existed and thus is lacking some of the more modern features.
In particular it does not support .dvi file formats which appears to
be the likely Axiom documentation format. Active DVI (ADVI) supports
several interesting features including animated gifs (which will allow
the graphics to move in a .dvi file) and inline command prompts (which
will allow the user to type live Axiom commands into a document). It
probably supports hyperlinks also but I haven't checked into it yet.
I have Active DVI in my local source tree but have not yet got it
integrated properly.

Pamphlet files are intended as the primary document format. They are
little more than TeX files with a few additional tags, namely:

A code chunk definition for "any string" looks like:
<<any string>>=
... define code here ...
@

A code chunk reference to the "any string" definition looks like:
<<any string>>

The "default" code definition block is:
<<*>>
... default block ...
@

You can extract the documentation from a pamphlet file by typing:
noweave foo.pamphlet >foo.tex

You can extract the code from a pamphlet file by typing:
notangle foo.pamphlet >foo.lang

You can extract a particular code chunk from a pamphlet file by typing:
notangle -R"any string" foo.pamphlet >foo.lang

And you have an inline quoting mechanism to skip TeX format
[[ $foo\crufty!filename.nonsense ]]

(The literate programming package we use is by Norman Ramsey called noweb
with changes by me).

Everything else is TeX. Which produces .dvi files. Which needs 
hyperlinks. Which needs a .dvi browser. Which is coming.

Virtually every source file (including Makefiles) is now a pamphlet.
Look at src/algebra/dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet which is a first attempt
at documenting the algebra. All of these documents are based on the
primary research papers. The algebra documentation will eventually
show up where the DeveloperNotes.dvi file lives.

The Makefile.pamphlet files are where the most documentation exists
so far. We've been documenting the build process as we write it so
other people can understand and modify it.

Now we're trying to bring the book back to life. We've added one
chapter by Martin Dunstan for programmers and I'm writing a second 
new chapter with a tutorial on how to use the compiler.

VM/CMS! Wow, a blast from the past. I started at IBM working as a
VM systems programmer. Gerry Bozman and I wrote the free storage
mechanism that VM uses. VM was a beautiful operating system. The
complete definition of its behavior was contained in the hardware
reference manual which made it really easy to understand exactly
what it should do.

If you understand an area of math try finding the research papers
that support the Axiom algorithms. Hunt down the authors and get
permission to use their research paper. Rewrite it into the pamphlet
files that use the results and upload it to the CVS. You learn. The
research lives. Axiom get documented. We all benefit.

Or find a recent paper that contains research that Axiom needs. 
There is some beautiful work on symbolic summation that Axiom needs.
Not only would this be new documentation but also new algebra.
Carstan Schneider and Burkhard Zimmerman at RISC-LINZ appear to
have done very interesting work in this area.

Hello,

While preparing screenshots for Axiom web page, I tried Tim's
integral-longer-than-the-screen but it failed on my home compiled Axiom:

(1) -> integrate(1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)
 
   >> System error:
   Cannot open the file /home/david/pub/axiom-libre/axiom-dm/axiom-i386/mnt/linux/algebra/SIGNEF.o.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

However, it seems to work for a more simpler integral:


(1) -> integrate(1/(x**2),x)

          1
   (1)  - -
          x
                                          Type: Union(Expression Integer,...)

Or even more complicated one:

(1) -> integrate(x**(1/3),x)

          3+-+
        3x\|x
   (1)  ------
           4
                                          Type: Union(Expression Integer,...)
(2) -> integrate(1/(x**(1/3)),x)

         3+-+2
        3\|x
   (2)  ------
           2
                                          Type: Union(Expression Integer,...)


Is the failure only in my version or is it a new axiom bug?

Yours,
d.

Hello,

What is the current status of TeXmacs related to Axiom?

Bill, you said previously[1] that you had a patch for TeXmacs to use the
latest version of Axiom prompt? Could you send it to me. I would like to
make some fancy screen shots for the new Axiom web site.

If I remember correctly, you get back from your trip today. :)

Yours,
d.

David,

The issue is that TeXmacs expects 2 prompts (the NAG version gives 2
prompts at startup) and the current version give one. It should be 
a simple change in the startup script somewhere. Given that the NAG
version has been off the market for 2 years come Oct 1 I suppose it
is time to drop it from TeXmacs.

Tim

It was not so simple to understand the code but I found the issue. Here
is the patch.

The prompt patch is a one liner:
-    else if (code==PROMPT) { if ((++prompts)==2) break; }
+    else if (code==PROMPT) break;
but I have taken the liberty to fix warning issued by gcc when compiling
with -Wall.

One remaining warning is left. 
tm_axiom.c: In function `session':
tm_axiom.c:231: warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'
I have not touched it. To late for me, I would risk introducing new bugs.

> Given that the NAG version has been off the market for 2 years come

Yes, sure. I take care of forwarding this patch to the TeXmacs
developers.

Yours,
d.

I have found a simpler error case:

(1) -> integrate(1/x,x)

David,

In the src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet there is a section called 
"Broken Files" which did not compile. I've been working on making
these compile. SIGNEF is one of them.

I have a patch so that the spad sources show up under mnt also.
I have not uploaded it yet as I need to test it from scratch.

I've been meaning to reply to your email of last week but I was
involved in a local conference on group theory and have been busy
with hosting duties all week. This is the first time I've been able
to touch Axiom again. Sorry for the delay.

Also of interest: I appear to have a contact at Red Flag linux
who is considering what it would take to ship it with that system.
This would make 2 distributions that include Axiom: Debian (thanks
to Camm) and Red Flag. I'm still searching for contacts at the 
other distributions.

I have a bunch of things to say, but haven't typed everything up yet, 
so let me start with what I have:

First of all, congratulations on getting the Axiom project up and 
running. Clearly the design philosophy that Tim is proposing for Axiom 
is do the Right Thing even if it takes time. A very rare perspective 
indeed, these days. I appreciate that much. At the moment I'm compiling 
Axiom on an x86 Linux box downstairs from me. Seeing how things are 
going, it seems I should soon be able to run it on my own Mac and/or 
DEC.

- Mac OS X, case issues: this goes wrong right when I get the CVS. When 
I check out the files, it just refuses to check out both 
FOO.input.pamphlet and foo.input.pamphlet. It seems that the 
.input.pamphlet files are the only files that cause this problem. Is it 
possible to just rename these file, like foo.* and big-foo.* or so? Or 
stick them in a different directory?

- Mac OS X, build issues: as the only build instructions in README 
involved /spad/mnt/linux, I just literally copied them to see what 
would happen. I know GCL hasn't been ported yet, but I thought I'd see 
how far I'd get.

[japie:/spad] weel% sudo bash
Password:
bash-2.05b# export AXIOM=/spad/mnt/linux
bash-2.05b# export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
bash-2.05b# make

/spad/int/lib/fnct_key.c: In function `handle_function_key':
/spad/int/lib/fnct_key.c:308: `SIGCLD' undeclared (first use in this 
function)
/spad/int/lib/fnct_key.c:308: (Each undeclared identifier is reported 
only once
/spad/int/lib/fnct_key.c:308: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [/spad/obj/linux/lib/fnct_key.o] Error 1

In BSD-based systems such as OS X, SIGCLD is called SIGCHLD. I would 
gladly start patching the code to deal with this kind of stuff, but I'd 
like to know if there is any policy about conditionalizing code. Can I 
just use a couple of #ifdef c.q. #+'s?

- Common Lisp implementation. There was concern from the French side 
about the speed of the underlying Lisp. The fastest free Lisps are 
probably CMUCL/SBCL. I am specifically mentioning SBCL here. It is very 
similar to CMUCL, but it is easier to port. This is because CMUCL needs 
CMUCL to build, whereas SBCL will build with another base lisp -- 
thanks to Christophe Rhode-- such as dreadfully slow but hyper-portable 
CLISP. There is, among others, a port to OS X. I just installed the 
binary and it's blazing (almost 2x OpenMCL on a simple test case).

For benchmarks, see http://lispm.dyndns.org:8000/ , 
http://www.cliki.net/Performance%20Benchmarks , 
http://www.cliki.net/Performance%20Benchmarks , 
http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/craps.shtml .

I like the idea of compiling against more than one lisp. Various 
implementations each have their advantages, that the advanced Axiom 
user should be able to choose from. Also, it will eliminate non-ANSI 
code, as has been seen already with ONEP. More about ONEP later. At any 
rate, I think SBCL may be a little cleaner and more portable to use 
than CMUCL.

ONEP is a common predicate in some older Lisps, but not in Common Lisp. 
It appears in McCarthy's Lisp 1.5 
(http://green.iis.nsk.su/~vp/doc/lisp1.5/mccarthy.html). It's supposed 
to test if it's argument is equal to 1. Problem is that in the Lisp 
world, there are various interpretations of "equal" and "1". Let the 
show begin.

McCarthy in the mentioned reference writes:

	onep[x] is true if |x-1| <= 3*10^6

So far so good.

 From simp.lisp in the Maxima sources, which probably reflects Maclisp:
";; The following definitions of ONEP and ONEP1 are bummed for speed, 
and should
;; be moved to a special place for implementation dependent code.
;; ONEP is the same as (EQUAL A 1), but does the check inline rather 
than
;; calling EQUAL (uses more instructions, so this isn't done by 
default).  ONEP
;; seems to be used very rarely, so it seems hardly worth the effort.  
On the
;; Lisp Machine, this is probably more efficient as simply (EQUAL A 1).

#+(and cl (not cmu))
(defmacro onep (a) `(eql ,a 1))

#+cl
(DEFMFUN ONEP1 (A) (OR (and (numberp a) (= A 1)) (EQUAL A BIGFLOATONE)))

#-cl
(progn 'compile
(DEFMFUN ONEP (A)
   #-NIL (AND (EQ (ml-typep A) 'fixnum) (= A 1))
   #+NIL (eql a 1))

#-(or Franz cl)
(DEFMFUN ONEP1 (A) (OR (EQUAL A 1) (EQUAL A 1.0) (EQUAL A 
BIGFLOATONE)))"

However, in the Standard Lisp Report (an early standardization effort):

"
ONEP(U:any):boolean eval, spread.
	Returns T if U is a number and has the value 1 or 1.0. Returns NIL
	otherwise.

	EXPR PROCEDURE ONEP(U);
	OR(EQN(U, 1), EQN(U, 1.0));

[The definition in the published report is incorrect as it does not 
return T for U of 1.0.]
"

There's clearly a lot of confusion about what ONEP should do. I think, 
however, that you can easily check experimentally in a GCL interpreter 
which interpretation GCL uses. I don't have a GCL here, but it 
shouldn't be hard. Keep in mind the difference between the functions =, 
eq, eql, and equal. For that, see sections 6.3 and 12.3 in CLtL2 
(Common Lisp the Language 2, available online).

With SBCL:

* (= 1 1.0)
T
* (eq 1 1.0)
NIL
* (eql 1 1.0)
NIL
* (equal 1 1.0)
NIL
* (= 1 1)
T
* (eq 1 1)
T
* (eql 1 1)
T
* (equal 1 1)
T

At any rate, it seems likely that either of the following is the right 
thing:

(defun onep (x) (= x 1))
(defun onep (x) (eq x 1))

I don't think McCarthy's definition is relevant.

Jaap,

re: congrats. 
Thanks. Many people have worked hard to make it happen.

re: Mac OS X and Case
I'll rename or delete the uppercase files. The whole input file
scheme is going to change and the upper case files aren't necessary
anyway.

re: build issues
I borrowed a Mac running OS X and found somebody who had a gcc for it.
If you know how to port it to the Mac go for it. I ran into the fnct_key
issue also last week. Unfortunately I've been helping to host a group
theory conference and haven't touched it all week. Use #ifdef and #+
whenever you make a porting change. The general philosophy is that
Axiom should run everywhere on everything. You might want to check
with Camm about the Mac OS X GCL port.

re: common lisp
I have CMUCL, CLISP, and GCL running here but haven't had the chance
to look at ports. Axiom used to run on all of these as well as symbolics,
golden common, IBUKI, Franz, Lucid, CCL, and VMLISP. It should be the
case that Axiom is pure common lisp but you'll find idioms from all of
these other lisps laying around (e.g. KAF file format is the internal
file format for VMLISP). Each one has their special contribution.
CMUCL has a great (disassemble) function that I used heavily to 
optimize function calling.

David,

I am sorry that I was so slow in replying - jet lag ...

Your patch below is nearly the same as the changes I made
in my version of texmacs.

You will probably also have noticed that there is a bug
that sometimes causes Axiom ouput to be improperly formatted.
For example, if you start a new TeXmacs session and then
select Text/Session/Axiom from the menu and enter

  integrate(sin(x),x)

The ouput appears as

... UNISEG.o for domain UniversalSegment -cos(x)

with the result appended to the loading messages. But
subsequent commands work properly. The autoload message
is getting confused with the LaTex code that is generated
for the result. Issuing the command

  )set message autoload off

eliminates the problem by eliminating the Loading messages.

Maybe the patch to tm_axiom.c should also include this
command in the startup phase

--------
   /* force-feeding */
+  fputs(")set messages autoload off\n",axin); fflush(axin);
+#ifdef LOG
+  fputs("SENT )set messages autoload off\n",log); fflush(log);
+#endif
   fputs(")set messages prompt plain\n",axin); fflush(axin);
--------

Looking more closely, it seems that Axiom sometimes embeds
the autoload messages in the output stream in what seems a
strange order.

--------
)set output tex
integrate(sin(x),x)

   Loading ...

$$
   Loading /home/wspage/projects/axiom2/mnt/linux/algebra/UNISEG.o for
      domain UniversalSegment
-{\cos
\left(
{x}
\right)}
\leqno(1)
$$
--------

It is not yet clear to me at this time how to get TeXmacs to handle
such messages properly in all cases (look for "Loading ..." embedded
in the tex?), or whether perhaps a change can be /should be made to
axiom to avoid generating these messages inside the tex $$ ... $$
section.

Maybe the Loading ... messages should be sent to stderr rather
than stdout?
 
Cheers,
Bill Page.

Hello,

Thanks to the hard work made by Antoine Hersen, the redesigned Axiom web
site will be available in less 6 hours from the date of this email.

Web design is always subjective by I like a lot Antoine's work. I hope I
won't be alone.

I have put my email address as Webmaster hyperlink for the interim. In
the long term, we will probably need to setup a sort of email
aliase. Should we use a private savannah mailing list (axiom-website,
open to anybody)?

Antoine, I have made few modifications to the file you sent to me:
 - replacement of script.sh by a Makefile

 - menu update

 - rewrote the README

 - some other details I have probably forgotten.

All source .pre files and generated .html files are now in the CVS. 


Let me know if you see issues, typos, information to add, ...


Yours,
d.

I tried this but it does not work. The Axiom prompt never appears in
TeXmacs. By putting the ")set messages autoload off" later (after ")set
output algebra off"), it partially works. One need to type two <return>
to obtain Axiom result.

> Looking more closely, it seems that Axiom sometimes embeds

Would it be possible to delay the autoload message before or after the
output stream?

I think it would be the best solution: outside $$ ... $$.

I've not look at Axiom internals but maybe is it possible to use two
buffers to prepare Axiom output?

This approach would raise other issues. It would complicate the build
process if you want all messages output by Axiom. 

Moreover, it might be necessary to have autoload messages (and other
information messages) under TeXmacs if it becomes the default Axiom user
interface. The more I think about it, the more I think we should keep
Axiom output as much unaltered as possible: keep all Axiom prompt, just
remove prompt number and typeset mathematical output.


By the way, I also noticed that there is some display glitches in
TeXmacs with following command:

  integrate(x**(1/3),x)

I have asked on texmacs-dev on the best way to fix this issue.


Yours,
d.

Oops. My fault. I should have checked that. Thanks for the remainder.

Cool. It will fix the debian bug.

Just an idea: it might be useful to implement in TeXmacs facilities to
lookup into spad files and display relevant part. Or maybe Emacs is just
better for this.

No issue. It is just that the axiom-developer mailing list was so quite
recently... :)

I'll try to see what I can do locally.

Hello Jaap,

Thank you for the pointer on Lisp performances. I have an iBook lying
around (under Linux), so I should probably have a look to SBCL.

Same results with GCL 2.5.2:

As tim said, GCL is now ported on MacOS X. Just grab latest GCL stable
release (should be 2.6.1).

No need to be root to compile axiom. :)

Hello,

The redesigned web site is now online. You'll notice that the
mathematics used in the screenshots section is not very difficult. :)
  http://www.nongnu.org/axiom/screenshots.html

I would gladly accept any axiom input that would either show some pretty
formula or some nice Axiom capabilities, especially compared to Axiom
proprietary "competitors".


Otherwise, I have a question related to Axiom birthday. Tim, on savannah
web page you say that Axiom development started in 1973. However, in
Makefile.dvi, it is said that Scratchpad started in 1971. What is Axiom
birthdate? 1971 or 1973?

Yours,
d.

Good job, guys. Congrats.

David, the mailing lists are rather permanent objects. Since I expect
that the volume of mail for the website will be rather low I'd prefer
to use the developer list at the moment. If the volume becomes an
issue we can certainly fork off a new list. 

On the "mailing list page" (axiom/community.html) the phrase
"All right reserved" appears. Perhaps we should remove that.

Can you make the mailing list names on the mailing list page
links to the list archives?

The pages all have the word "about" in the top right corner.

On the download.html page we should have a link to 
http://axiom.tenkan.org
Better yet, if somebody can figure out how to upload files to the
download area we should move the whole tenkan file and page to the
Axiom savannah site. I think Bill Page figured out how to do this.

re: Axiom birthday. Nobody knows. The project traces back to a 
prior project called MODLISP which gradually morphed into Scratchpad,
which morphed into Scratchpad II, which officially became Axiom.
MODLISP was a late 60s project (around 1967 I believe). I chose
1971 because "30 years" is a good time frame and I started the
campaign to release Axiom in August of 2001.

Tim

re: TeXmacs and Axiom sources. Certainly whatever tool we use 
should know a bit about the structure of algebra files. The
pamphlet files have \sections for each domain. We need to 
generate a bibtex file that gives references for each domain
to its source file. That will allow both TeXmacs and an Active
DVI based browser to find the sources for a domain. Axiom knows
which file contains the sources and you can do:

asq -so Integer

and it will tell you the source file that contains it. 

re: quiet list
yeah, I'm rewriting the book and it is a lot harder than it would seem.
Bill has been off wasting his time travelling. You've been working on
another project (gasp!). Never fear. Progress is happening.

Ah, so I don't have to port GCL to Mac OS X. Great news. I'll download
the 2.6.1 release and also do a linux build on it.

I don't understand this objection.  The build process for what?

I agree that autoload messages should be made available to the user.
Can't TeXmacs grap the stderr output as well?  They could go in another
buffer, for instance.

The intended use of stderr is for adminstrative messages like this.
It's easy to either (a) combine the two streams or (b) do something
special with the stderr output.

Peace,

David,

I am sorry that I did not take the time last night to
provide a complete working patch, I just keyed those
commands from memory. But there is a little more that
needs to be done to synchronize axiom's output with the
texmacs interface. I have attached a full patch file
from diff -Naur which includes both your and my changes
to the tm_axiom.c file. This sets the default for the
autoload messages to off just as it was for the older
"commercial" version of Axiom. It also fixes the -Wall
warnings.

I don't see any problem (in principle) with sending
Loading ... messages to stderr. These are essentially
"debugging" messages. It is common practice that they
should go to stderr. I think it might help to "tidy-up"
the output of the Axiom build output if stderr output
were not included unless some option was specified. But
this is not so important.

In the commercial version of Axiom these messages were
not displayed by default. But in this "developer" version
of Axiom, maybe it makes sense that the default should be
to display them. In any case the display can be control
by the )set messages command.

If I get time, I will see if I can understand Axiom's tex
output generation code enough to change it so that all
Loading... messages preceed any tex output. I agree that
this would probably be the best option. And as you note,
there may be other things we may want to change to bring
the generated tex up to modern "standards".

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Ok. I'm not sure to have express my issue very clearly. At the bottom of
each page, there is an hyperlink Webmaster that currently points to my
email address. The pointed Webmaster email needs to be open to
anybody. In other words, it can't be the current mailing lists (like
axiom-developer) that need subscription, confirmation, etc. That's why I
was looking for an alternative, like using a non-public mailing-list
open to anybody.

Of course, I can put anybody else as webmaster, I don't mind.

I have added an Archive link for each mailing list. Moreover, the
mailing list name points to the corresponding subscription web page.

Antoine. I don't know what was his intent.

I was wondering if it is very useful to put this version of Axiom (the
tenkan one) to be downloadable. If people use this version (that, if I
remember correctly, contains free code but was built with a non-free
Axiom), they won't find issues in the CVS version. The behavior of Axiom
might also be different. In other words, two code base to maintain.

Yours,
d.

Hello Dylan,

[ about redirecting error messages to stderr & build process ]

I was thinking of logging the compilation of Axiom in a file to then do
analysis on what might have failed during compilation. But as Tim
pointed out earlier, compiling Axiom in an Emacs shell solve this
issue. So I withdraw my objection.

I don't know. I'll ask to TeXmacs people.

Your right. It's just I'm too lazy to use shell facilities to redirect
shell outputs.

Yours,
d.

Ok, thanks. I'll forward this version to texmacs people.

Unfortunatly, there is another bug: Frdric Lehobey and myself noticed
yesterday that the )show command blocks the interaction between TeXmacs
and Axiom. Try for example ')show Integer' under TeXmacs.

As I previously answered to Dylan, you are both right. So we need to
have a look at Axiom output to redirect error messages to stderr.

Yours,

What are the strongest reasons for not making
)set message autoload off
the default? I am sure there must be good reasons, otherwise it would
have been done.

A more generalized solution would be to allow for a system-wide
configuration file as well as a local .axiom.inputs file under each
user's home directory, with the local configuration overriding
settings in the system-wide file (e.g., /etc/axiom.input) under Unix;
suitable locations under other operating systems.

With apologies in advance if this has all been discussed and settled
long ago, or if there is a relevant feature of the software that I am
missing.

Axiom has system defaults built in. These can be set in the code
so there is no need for a system-wide default file.

User defaults exist in .axiom.input in the user's home directory.

*,

Redirecting messages to stderr can be done by changes to the messaging code.
Since a few options need to be changed for TeXmacs perhaps we should consider
a new command line option like:

)set interface texmacs

so we can collect all of the changes in one place.

Comments?

David,

re: tenkan version.

I agree that we probably should not copy it. A better strategy would be to
have each of us responsible for a different distribution and upload our
builds. I have been trying to get Axiom to build on Mandrake 9.1, Suse 6.4, 
BSD 4.8, Debiab 30R1, Mac OS X 10.1 and Windows XP, so far with little
success due mostly to the socket libraries (these are the distribs I have
laying around or tried in the past). Clearly we need a #define cleanup
effort in the C code. 

I do think we need binary distribs as not everyone will have the time and
patience to build Axiom from scratch. I use binary distribs for large
projects like Mozilla (the source is about 40M!).

Tim

Oh, it reminds me that I asked our local Mandrake packaging guru if he
could package Axiom. He told me that the
directory-path-should-not-be-uppercase bug is a show stopper: the
default build directory for Mandrake packages is RPMS (or something like
that).


> I do think we need binary distribs as not everyone will have the time and

Of course. The question is: at which step do we do our binary releases?

If you judge that the current CVS version should have a binary release,
then I'll upload to savannah my own build with instructions to setup
$AXIOM and launch it.

Yours,
d.

So evident I wonder why we haven't think of it before.

> Comments?

Have you an idea of where is the "messaging" code? I have tried some
greps in src/interp/ directory but failed to find it. In the
src/interp/i-* files?

By the way, it reminds me that we also need a kind of map to navigate
into the code. The very first step would be an index where it is say
what is the purpose of each file, or at least to what sub-system it
pertains.

Here is a small perl script that creates an index of all Boot function

This script can be used in a 'M-x grep' of Emacs.

It is possible to redirect stderr to a special TeXmacs buffer according
to Joris. He pointed me to:

Hello,

I have uploaded a binary version of Axiom for linux/i386 into savannah
download zone:
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=axiom

Tim, is it ok like this? If yes, I'll announced it on savannah news and
axiom-mail.


For future version, I'll probably rename axiom-i386-cvs-(release).tar.gz
into axiom-linux-i386-cvs-(release).tar.gz so that we could upload
version for *BSD systems.


Yours,
d.

And I forgotten: many thanks to Bill for his detailed explanations on
uploading, they were very very useful.

David,

Emacs has a "tags" facility which can select out function names. I haven't used
it in years. It is called "etags" (run man etags). You might find it more useful
and general than building Perl scripts.

Tim

Oh yes, good idea. Do you know if TAGS file format is documented
somewhere? It does not seem very complicated but I would prefer not
reverse engineered it.

I see I'm going to have to be system specific with that issue.
The top level makefile builds a custom makefile for each target platform.
I'll add a CASE= tag so we can pass the information into the build.

David,

The upload is fine but you need to tag it with the linux version you used
to build it, or at least a statement about which systems it runs. I have
found thru the Rosetta effort that a RedHat 9 linux build will not run on
all other linux distributions. If you tag it with your distribution and
others have different versions (for instance I have both Redhat 9 and 7.3
running here) we all can add to the tags.

Other than that item,... great work.

Tim

Hmmm. I don't like the idea of being system specific. Is it really
necessary?

If I remember correctly:

 - any Unix system (linux, *bsd, solaris, MacOS X with UFS,...): case
   sensitive path and filename

 - MacOS X with HFS: no distinction between lower/uppercase, case
    sensitive path
    => no distinct file with filenames different only on lower/upper
       case 

 - Windows: no distinction between lower/uppercase, case insensitive
    path 
    => as previous MacOS X case



So for me, we have the following requirements:

 1. each source file should have a distinct filename if converted to
    lowercase;

 2. the build process should not modify lower/uppercase of paths.


With those requirements, I think we could build Axiom on any current
system. You opinion?

Yours,
d.

More exactly, the requirements are:

 1. each source file should have a distinct path and filename filename
    if path and filename are converted to lowercase;

 2. the build process should not modify lower/uppercase of paths.

David,

The issue is more complex than that. There is an interaction with common lisp
which is not, by default, case sensitive. Some of the filenames are passed as
strings and some are passed as symbols (for historic reasons as some of the
old lisps required symbols and ignored case). We can't set the common lisp to
be case sensitive as Axiom uses both upper and lower case functions of the 
same name (due to the use of Boot, which IS case sensitive).

There is no such thing as a simple job.

Tim

I'll put case on the list of bugs to fix.

I'll also upload the update for the current input filenames which are dual-case.

David,

Could you also update the Axiom webpages to show the systems where Axiom is 
known to build?

As I already wrote in a previous mail, the axiom system should
preserve case. The case mangling is done, because the makefile
hands a list of lisp symbols and not a list of lisp strings
to the build-interpsys function. This is easily solvable=20
with gnu make as indicated in my mail.

Yes. With that little change to the makefile and the elimination
of the case folding, things should work out.

Hello,

Here is a remark of Joris about the TeXmacs interface:

  "This does not withhold that you really should make the interface
   backward compatible. As Andrey Grozin remarked to me this weekend,
   there are still quite a few people around with the old version of
   Axiom."


I haven't the willing neither the possibility to support this.

Yours,
d.

Sure. I have uploaded following information I know of (in the FAQ page):

    <dt>On which system is known to run Axiom?</dt>
    <dd> 

        People have compiled and run Axiom on:
        <ul>
           <li>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 and sid, on i386, Sparc64 and PowerPC</li>
           <li>RedHat Linux 7.3 and 9.0 on i386</li>
        </ul>

    </dd>

Let me know for other systems (*bsd, MacOS X, ...).

Yours,
d.

I don't know how for Tim has got on Mac OS X, but I thought I'd just 
mention what I had so no-one has to repeat it all. If you got much 
further, please just ignore this.

Added Makefile.mac section to Makefile.pamphlet:
"

Added
"
/** On some systems, such as the Mac, SIGCLD is called SIGCHLD **/
#if defined(MACplatform)
#define SIGCLD SIGCHLD
#endif
"
to src/lib/fnct_key.c.pamphlet

Added /usr/X11R6/include to INC path in src/lib/Makefile.pamphlet

Question: is this necessary? Without this, the C preprocessor fails to 
find X11/Xlib.h, but how on earth does it find it on Linux?

Made scripts in src/scripts executable

Question: is this necessary? Without this, make barfs, but how on earth 
does it do this on Linux?

awk and gawk:
noweb, in its current configuration, explicitly calls gawk. Macs ship 
with awk. If I symlink gawk --> awk on my system, it gets rid off the 
errors. I see some mechanism in noweb to deal with this, but don't 
quite understand it. Any thoughts?

Ah, another simple job, eh? :-)

Clearly we don't have the ability to support NAG's version of Axiom because
we don't have the whole distribution. I'd be willing to but can't because
of licensing reasons (Mike, could I become a "support licensee" of NAG?
Can you sublicense support?). 

(Barry, your question is related to the support sublicense issue)

I don't see why texmacs doesn't just let both prompts show up just like
they do in the normal console. 

Joris, does letting both prompts show up cause an issue for TeXmacs (not
the NAG users, just TeXmacs)?

Are there reasons why people with the old version would not be able to 
upgrade? NAG numerical stuff, maybe?

> I haven't the willing neither the possibility to support this.
Well, it seems that TeXmacs wants specific control characters, right? 
And that means you patched Axiom to have a TeXmacs mode where it emits 
those, right? So without patching the source, you can't really do this, 
right? It seems like an iffy business, and I would tend to agree it's 
not worth the trouble.

Jaap,

The NAG version has a pretty user interface which we need to replace,
the graphics which is coming, the hyperdoc which is coming, the NAG libraries
which will be supported (I believe you only have to have the license to use 
them and they are a separate package) but will be available using open source
replacements. The NAG version also runs on a few more platforms but work is
underway to fix this also.

I believe the TeXmacs interface is of very recent origin so backward 
compatibility is probably a non-issue.

Tim

Tim,

The problem is with the synchronization of the
input/output between Axiom and TeXmacs. There is
a small "filter" program called tm_axiom which fits
between Axiom and TeXmacs. The filter needs to know
when it can send a buffer originating from TeXmacs
to Axiom. It does this by waiting for the Axiom
prompt -> to be output by Axiom. The original version
of tm_axiom expected two such prompts before it
would begin to send the TeXmacs buffer to Axiom.
The change that David and I have made to tm_axiom
causes it to wait for only one Axiom prompt.

I am not sure, but I suspect that this change will
not break the interface between the older versions
of Axiom which do generate two prompts. The result of
our change is that tm_axiom will send the buffer
immediately after receiving the first prompt. Axiom
should simply issue one more prompt and then read the
buffer from it's input anyway. Unfortunately, I am
not able to test this since I do not have access to
any earlier versions of Axiom.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

It does for the glue between Axiom and TeXmacs.

No, the change definitely breaks the old interface.
Would it be very incomfortable for you guys to stick
to the old prompt for a while? That would definitely
solve the problem...

Joris,

The old prompt is actually issued by a separate process.
The key difference is the first prompt has a (1) line number
whereas the second prompt has a gensym that represents the
namespace of the current session.

Who is axiom@texmacs.org?

Tim

I see two solutions to this prompt problem:

  * [Best] check the version of the axiom system and
    do something specific for each version.

  * [Hack] let axiom behave as before for TeXmacs as
    far as the prompt is concerned.

Me, Andrey, god, and a few others.
You want to be there too?

Bill,

There are four paths that seem possible for republishing the book:

(1) O'Reilly press, which is very open source friendly. 

  You might try contacting them to see if they might publish a new
  volume (changed from the current version, lacking color plates, 
  adding a CD). 

(2) Dover, which republishes old books cheaply.

  We really can't afford to have the book be expensive anymore.

(3) Self-publish

  I believe it is possible to get a run of about 1000 books published
  by a regular publisher for a flat fee. That is an optimistic estimate
  of the number of axiom books sold or given away in the next 30 years.
  (I twice tried to write textbooks and was told that >3k is a bestseller)
  I'm not sure what the minimum number would be. It would be helpful to know.

(4) Pamphlet form
  
  If we carefully structure the book properly you may be able to print
  the book locally, hole punch it, and ring-binder it yourself. This
  would allow for incremental updates. I've played with this a little
  bit with the current version but am ambivalent about it. This would
  allow us to issue chapter updates and give a "standard" for pamphlet
  and booklet files.

The key issue is that we want the book to continue to be modified BSD
rather than copyright anybody. I have heard rumors that O'Reilly has
done such a thing. Dover might but I don't know. I'd like the CD to
accompany the book to contain the source text of the book and various
other useful things including Axiom sources.

The new version of the book is going to end up significantly different
from the NAG version. It is starting out with the source text (well,
the hyperdoc language version) but I'm adding and deleting chapters,
rewriting and adding examples, rewriting paragraphs, fixing problems,
etc.  I've formatted the book into pamphlet form, rewritten the tags,
regenerated the pictures, etc.  In spirit they will be similar but in
practice the book is a complete rewrite.  I'm trying to maintain the
"look and feel". Shortly it will fracture into booklet form but I have
to debug some of the machinery I'm trying to use first.

How do we generate pictures?  (I know the GUI is not here yet, but I'd
love to be able to generate a picture by hand.)

David,

The following patch to src/algebra/tex.spad.pamphlet
generates \sqrt[n]{x} instead of \root{n} \of {x}.
This form is converted properly by texmacs and corrects
the problem with the display of

  integrate(x**(1/3),x)

that you mentioned in a previous email. Since TEX is
in layer15 of the algebra Makefile, re-building Axiom
doesn't take very long and you can simply patch
tex.spad.pamphlet and re-run make from your AXIOM root
directory.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Bill,

Another possible distribution path for the book is to construct a KNOPPIX CD
rather than a paper book. This would be bootable without disturbing someones
opsys. Of course, I don't know how to go about making an Axiom-Knoppix CD but
it is almost certainly possible.

Tim

Bill,

These are not equivalent. Put the following lines in t.tex:

$\sqrt[n]{x}$

$\root{n} \of {x}$

\bye

Then type: 

tex t.tex
xdvi t.dvi

The results are nowhere near the same. The \root... form generates the correct
result. The problem must reside on the TeXmacs side.

David,

I do not have any problem with the )show Integer command
with my version of TeXmacs (most recent stable version
1.0.2) under RedHat 9.0. See attached PDF file.

The PDF file shows the problem with TeXmacs incorrect
interpretation of

  \root{3} \of {x}

Although this notation might be somewhat deprecated,
vis.

  \sqrt[3]{x}

I think it is acceptible to most current LaTex
implementations, so in my opinion this is best seen
as a limitation of TeXmacs.

If we do invent a new interface option such as Tim
suggested

  )set interface texmacs

then maybe rather than using the existing Tex
generation in Axiom, we should go to TeXmacs'
"scheme" notation which in some respects is more
general that LaTeX. Maybe this is too ambitious?

Also, you can see the error message generated by
AXIOM when it starts up

  "AXIOM Sockets The AXIOM server number is undefined"

I think we should try to get rid of this. Also, I think
we should review the text that Axiom outputs at startup:

-------------------------------------------------------
Issue )copyright to view copyright notices.
Issue )summary for a summary of useful system commands.
Issue )quit to leave AXIOM and return to shell.
Sunday August 31,2003 at 7:30:21=20
-------------------------------------------------------

This is not very relevant to users who access Axiom
from TeXmacs and boring to the experienced Axiom users
Maybe it would be better just to display a standard
banner with version information.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Bill,

The mechanism for generating tex code (via )set output tex on) is the same
mechanism for generating fortran code (via )set output fortran on). We could,
in a very general way, implement scheme code (via )set output texmacs on).
You can't change the meaning of the generated tex code as the previous 
interface relied on it and we may yet get a chance to use it again.
(It appears that the Techexplorer code has been sold to another company).
Look at the algebra files and you'll see how this works. Making a scheme
code generator is basically just cloning the methods for Tex generation and
generating your own scheme code.

The AXIOM Sockets message is generated because sman is not running. 
sman (superman) is the process that is really supposed to start when you
type axiom. It runs interpsys as a subprocess (as well as graphics, hypertex,
clef, etc). I have to get sman running to get the rest of it to run.

The code for this is coming but I need an alpha version of the book first
as the documentation is more important. 

We can easily get rid of all the headers. We could even create a 
)set headers off command that could be either the default or put in 
your .axiom.input file. I'll put this on the TODO list.

Tim

Tim,

TeX does not understand \sqrt[n]{} but LaTex does. Try

------- t.tex ---

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
$$
\sqrt[n]{x}
$$
$$
\root{n} \of {x}
$$
\end{document}

----------------

latex t.tex
xdvi t.dvi

Texmacs seems to prefer LaTex style input not the old
TeX style.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Tim,

Ok, Cloning tex.spad to texmacs.spad (or latex.spad) seems
fairly easy to me. But how do you implement a new command
like

  )set output texmacs on

??

Also, I am quite interested in this line-breaker program.
Texmacs does not seem to apply any line-break algorithm
to what Axiom generates <frown> so the output can look
quite unreasonable. For example I tried the first example
in the book:

  integrate(1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)

and the result is not much like the output as shown in
the book. It is all on one line.

I recall that the line break program was in C. Perhaps
it wouldn't be too hard to incorporate it into the
tm_axiom filter program.

This also brings to mind another option here. I could
modify the tm_axiom program to convert \root{n} \of {x}
to the LaTex form before passing it to TeXmacs. That way
we could continue to use Axiom's tex output.

Could you send me the line-break program? Then I will
give this a try.


Cheers,
Bill Page.

Yes, I understand that TeXmacs wants LaTex.
Axiom doesn't generate LaTex anywhere.
The TeX code is used in various places (including generating the book)
and tools depend on it (e.g. the line-breaker used to generate the book).
We can't change Axiom's TeX generation.

We could implement a TeXmacs code generator in parallel. (You'll get that
message in a few seconds. The net is rather fast tonight :-) )

Tim,

Try the last example on page 2

  )set output tex on
  radix(10**100,32)

That doesn't look like proper TeX or LaTex to me...

Cheers,
Bill.

I seem to be missing the header file

Could you please send it also?

The TeX generation depends on each domain to figure out the proper way
to format the output from that domain. (In Java terms each class has to
know how to Tex format its output). 

One of the hassles of creating the book is that various domains need work.
I could stop and fix them or I can continue work on the book. In this 
particular case it is prettier to generate \verbatim tags around the
original output rather than $$ .. $$ tags. However, the result is technically
correct as this IS math output. TeX doesn't usually deal in base 32 and any
author wouldn't normally rely on TeX to properly format strange base numbers.

The \leqno tag puts the equation number at the left. The $$ specifies a math
out-of-line format. The number is a proper base32 number. If I clip it and
tex it I get proper (albeit slanty) output.

Tim,

You wrote:

>From the stuff I clipped from the output of Axiom:

[wspage@asus wspage]$ cat t2.tex
$4#\I9#\L#\K#\I#\P9#\G#\R#\S#\T#\C5#\I#\F164#\P#\O5#\V72#\M#\E827226#\J#\S#\L#\A#\P462585#\Q7#\H00000000000000000000$
 
\bye

I get:

[wspage@asus wspage]$ tex t2.tex
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.3.1)
(t2.tex
! You can't use `macro parameter character #' in horizontal mode.
l.1 4#
     
\I9#\L#\K#\I#\P9#\G#\R#\S#\T#\C5#\I#\F164#\P#\O5#\V72#\M#\E827226#\J#\...
 
? 

----------

What am I doing wrong? The use of # seems incorrect to me.
But then I have never really used pure TeX.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Re: cloning. you need to look at the algebra code also. The tex is 
generated as a result of the algebra code output calls.

The file src/interp/setq.lisp.pamphlet contains the top level command list.
Search for the logic using the $systemCommands variable and you'll see how
these get processed. See src/interp/spad.lisp.pamphlet and follow the 
$texFormat variable and you'll see how TeX gets generated. 
In src/interp/setvars.boot.pamphlet you'll see the )set output tex command.
(beware that setvars.boot is a bootstrap file so you have to regen and reinsert
the generated .clisp file)

In the src/algebra/tex.spad.pamphlet file you'll find the domain that implements
TeX at the algebra level (TexFormat aka TEX). You could copy this domain and
make a TeXmacs domain which would implement the same interface. That way the
Tex and TeXmacs domains can be freely interchanged.

The source for the linebreak code is appended. This tool knows the form of
Axiom's TeX output code. To try it do:

(1) compile it
(2) start Axiom
(3) )set output tex on
(4) clip the tex output
(5) change the $$ ... $$ to \[ .. \]
(6) run this program
(7) tex the output

 * This program reads standard input and writes to standard output. Display math

Bill,

Where are you getting all of the #\ characters? I get:

What version are you running?

David,

Perhaps you might look in the latest Makefile.pamphlet file and extract
the list of people who worked on Axiom and post it on the website.

David,

It is probably sufficient to leave your userid as the webmaster.
If you don't want to use your userid send the webmaster mail to 
axiom@tenkan.org and I'll see that website changes get sent to you.

Hi,

The reason that the autoload messages were originally on by default is
historical - the AKCL version of Axiom was painfully slow at loading
code and this provided users with reassurance that something was
actually happening.  When we moved to CCL the loading speed was
significantly increased and we could also pre-load frequently used code
with minimal impact on the image size, so we switched the messages off
by default.

There is a system-wide configuration file: src/inputs/axiom.input which
behaves as you suggest.  The argument against having it in /etc is that
users might have AXIOM on an NFS mounted filesystem so its better to
keep everything together.  This is also why we created the share
directory to avoid having duplicate versions of things.

Cheers, Mike.

If you are using a TeX-based interface then you might want to consider
wiring in some of the code that exists for the TechExplorer interface
under Windows.  In particular we had a TeX-based browser interface which
you could wire in in place of )show, )what etc.  

The code for this lived in the file br-saturn.boot ("saturn" was the
codename for TechExplorer before IBM released it) and was not included
by default in the Unix build.  It modified the Lisp commands kSearch,
cSearch, dSearch etc. to produce TeX output with embeded hyperlinks.

We also had code to untangle the various message/output streams but
that was probably part of the code we were unable to release (since it
was modified TechExplorer sources).  

Cheers, Mike.

Mike, 

Perhaps you misunderstood my intent. I was not suggesting distributing 
NAG Axiom under a support license. I was suggesting setting up some 
sort of support for the current users (perhaps telneting into NAG hardware).
I hate to abandon users and would rather give them support until the full
version of Axiom lives again.

Tim

Hi Jaap,

Axiom expects the definition of onep to be "=" rather than eq.

Hi Tim,

We don't officially support Axiom any more, although from time to time I
help people out with minor problems.  Unfortunately we can't give out
parts of the code without IBM's agreement, which isn't going to happen.  

I know there are people using Axiom 2.3 still but I've no idea if they
use TeXmacs.  Also, if you get sman running aren't you going to revert
to the old behaviour?

Mike.

Greetings, all!  Just saw the wonderful work on the new website, and
am still digesting....

As there is a section on supported systems, I just wanted to report
that axiom is currently compiled on the following Debian GNU/Linux
platforms: 

mipsel, ia64, i386, ppc, alpha, and sparc

At the current moment, the remaining 6 are expected straightforwardly,
as GCL already carries maxima and acl2 to all these machines, and the
absence of these builds thus far is apparently due to an autobuilder
backlog.

You can follow the progress at 

http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=axiom

Another nice page to check is

http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/axiom.html

One note in case anyone wants to use axiom on the Itanium -- there is
a known and unique function calling issue on ia64 due to its
dynamically generated function descriptors.  What this means is that
upgrading the dynamic libraries on which axiom depends requires a
rebuild of axiom at present.  We may have a work around shortly, but
it seems there is not much demand for this fix.

Take care,

Hi Tim,

I understood what you meant but this still involves giving you access to
the IBM code which we aren't allowed to do.

Sorry, Mike.

Done (on the Community page).

David,

I am sorry that I was so slow in replying - jet lag ...

Your patch below is nearly the same as the changes I made
in my version of texmacs.

You will probably also have noticed that there is a bug
that sometimes causes Axiom ouput to be improperly formatted.
For example, if you start a new TeXmacs session and then
select Text/Session/Axiom from the menu and enter

  integrate(sin(x),x)

The ouput appears as

... UNISEG.o for domain UniversalSegment -cos(x)

with the result appended to the loading messages. But
subsequent commands work properly. The autoload message
is getting confused with the LaTex code that is generated
for the result. Issuing the command

  )set message autoload off

eliminates the problem by eliminating the Loading messages.

Maybe the patch to tm_axiom.c should also include this
command in the startup phase

--------
   /* force-feeding */
+  fputs(")set messages autoload off\n",axin); fflush(axin);
+#ifdef LOG
+  fputs("SENT )set messages autoload off\n",log); fflush(log);
+#endif
   fputs(")set messages prompt plain\n",axin); fflush(axin);
--------

Looking more closely, it seems that Axiom sometimes embeds
the autoload messages in the output stream in what seems a
strange order.

--------
)set output tex
integrate(sin(x),x)

   Loading ...

$$
   Loading /home/wspage/projects/axiom2/mnt/linux/algebra/UNISEG.o for
      domain UniversalSegment
-{\cos
\left(
{x}
\right)}
\leqno(1)
$$
--------

It is not yet clear to me at this time how to get TeXmacs to handle
such messages properly in all cases (look for "Loading ..." embedded
in the tex?), or whether perhaps a change can be /should be made to
axiom to avoid generating these messages inside the tex $$ ... $$
section.

Maybe the Loading ... messages should be sent to stderr rather
than stdout?
 
Cheers,
Bill Page.

I don't understand. I've just recompiled TeXmacs 1.0.2 and I can't get
the Axiom prompt after a ")show Integer".

Could you send me your tm_axiom.c? Maybe I have missed something there.

Hello Tim,

Is the Axiom book available (even partially) on CVS? Maybe people can
start reading the first chapters while you finish it?

Yours,

Tim,

I have been playing with the line-breaker program
that you sent me last night. My goal is to incorporate
it into the tm_axiom program so that TeXmacs will
display Axiom output nicely.

By "nicely" I was expecting essientially what I see in
the Jenks & Sutor "axiom" book. So my first experiment
was with the example on page 1

  )set output tex on
  integrate(1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)

I clipped the output between $$ $$ from Axiom into a file
named t1.tex. I added the \[  \] tokens and the other
usual LaTex decorations. Then I ran t1.tex through
line-breaker to get t2.tex. On stderr I got messages
like:

  Can split product: FALSE
  Can split (+,-,=, )-expression: FALSE

In fact everything came out false.

And as a result t2 looks almost like t1 except for some
spaces removed/added. When I LaTex it, the dvi does not
look anything like what I see on page 1 of the book.

Am I doing something wrong?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I'm currently working on a FreeBSD build of Axiom, using GCL. I've
done the hard stuff, and I'm now waiting for the compile to finish.

I've taken a machete to the build; the FreeBSD ports system already
has noweb and GCL, so I diked those out of the build. Also, I've
replaced all "  make foo" with "   ${MAKE} foo", as freebsd calls
gnu make "gmake", and gnu make knows to pass this name on. There
are a few other glitches.

I'll contribute diffs when its working :-)

Mark,

There are patches to noweb and GCL which are applied in the build process.
I'll look for the make vs ${MAKE}. Mea Culpa.

I'm happy to hear that it might build on FreeBSD. I have a BSD 4.8 port in
the queue of work to do but that won't happen anytime soon. It'll be great
if you do the "heavy lifting" :-)

David,

I have uploaded two versions of tm_axiom.c to

  http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=axiom

See especially

 
http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/axiom/axiom_texmacs.pkg/1.0.1/tm_axiom.c

Both of these versions work for me. I am running
TeXmacs 1.0.2 under RedHat 9.0 at home and TeXmacs
1.0.1.14 under RedHat 8.0 here at work. Both versions
of TeXmacs together with Axiom as compiled from CVS
as of 13 August, 2003 are able to execute the command

  )show Integer

and then continue to execute additional commands.

tm_axiom.c from Axiom_Texmacs 1.0.1 includes code
to convert \root{n}{x} to \sqrt[n]{x} to fix the
display problem you mentioned in a previous email.

Let me know if you have any problem with these.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Bill,

You probably are not doing anything wrong. I suspect the bug you've
encountered is causing the problem. I'm still chasing it.

Tim

Hmmm....

I'm still working with the line-breaker program. Does
this program actually work for you? For example, I
try to run the following through the program

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\[
{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+16+18}\ {40+41+42+43+44+45+46+47}
\]
\end{document}

It seems to split everything ok, inserting \begin{array}
\end{array}, but then right at the end the program
gives a

   Segmentation fault

I suspect something wrong with the memory allocation
but so far I don't see what it could be.

Please let me know if the above example works for you.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Bill,

Try losing the \documentclass, \begin, and \end lines.
Given this input:

\[
{1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+16+18}\ {40+41+42+43+44+45+46+47}
\]

and the command

./linebreak <t.tex >t.break

I get the output:

Width = 7759 units, Output line = 1.
  Can split product: TRUE
    Can split product: FALSE
    Can split (+,-,=, )-expression: TRUE
    Can split product: FALSE
    Can split (+,-,=, )-expression: TRUE

the t.break file contains:

\[
{
\begin{array}{@{}l}
\displaystyle
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 
\\
\\
\displaystyle
10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 
\\
\\
\displaystyle
16 + 18 
\end{array}
}\ {
\begin{array}{@{}l}
\displaystyle
40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45 + 46 + 
\\
\\
\displaystyle
47 
\end{array}
}
\]

with no segfaults.

Tim

Tim,

Ok, thanks. I've got it. The seg fault problem was
introduced when I clipped the text of the program from
your email. For no good reason that I can think of,
multiple blanks were replaced with single blanks. As
a result the char array 'blanks' which is supposed to
be about 60 blanks or so, was not properly initialized.

Jeez!

It's a kind of a "nice" old fashioned "C" program,
though ain't it?

Now back to what I really wanted to do.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I saw those, and I'm trying to see how far I can get without them. Otherwise,
if they look general purpose enough, I'd rather apply them to the FreeBSD
ports of noweb and GCL. Make sense?

The latest build error is an inability to find vmlisp.o when building
interpsys.

Thanks! No problem.

Mostly done :-) (I hope!)

Bill,

I've cornered the TeX bug but haven't had time to develop a fix.
I suspect that ELTing into a string produces #\A rather than A.
I'll check it later today. As a side-effect I've been writing up
the techniques used for finding this bug as a section in the
DevelopersNotes pamphlet.

Koen,

There is a known problem running the latest version of Axiom under TeXmacs.
There is a posted fix but I was not involved in it and don't know how to 
apply it to TeXmacs.

Joris, David, Bill,
Could you help this person with the details of the TeXmacs fix?

Koen,

The new open source version of Axiom is a little
different than the older commercial (NAG) version.
As a result, you must install an updated version
of the TeXmacs - Axiom interface program. Go to

  http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=axiom

and take a look at

  Axiom_Texmacs 1.0.2

Simple instructions are included in the README.txt
file.

and also the files under

  Axiom_Book

So far, this new interface for TeXmacs has not been
tested very much. Also TeXmacs 1.0.2 is a new version
of TeXmacs. I am beginning to think that this combination
shows a lot of promise, but I would have to say that the
behaviour is still a little "fagile". I was however able
to get through almost all of the computations in the
introduction section of the Axiom book and some initial
formatting of the contents in just a few hours last
night.

If you have any problems, I would be glad to try
to help.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Tim,

Yes, something as simple as

  )set output tex on
  elt("A",1)

shows the problem. I am very interested in your
debugging notes. I took a look again at the
tex.spad.pamphlet code, but I is as clear as "mud"
to me how this thing as a whole actually generates
TeX code! (Though I can of course relate to some
parts of it. <grin> )

So, do you still think that this is a LISP problem
or something else?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Greetings, and good to hear of everyone's work!

May I please suggest that we collectively move toward an axiom build
with an externally installed GCL?  To my knowledge, all of Tim's
patches are in 2.6.1 and higher but two (compiler noise and banner
removal), and I'd like to put in functionality to address these latter
two shortly (separate post forthcoming).  Mark, my intention is to
also merge in your BSD patches as well -- hopefully I'll find time to
get to it today.  I just feel it will be much harder to support GCL
with miscellaneous patches scattered about, not to mention that if the
patch author every should become unavailable, their effective
contribution to GCL may get lost.  Of course, this is lisp, and the
user can and should feel free to redefine/shadow whatever lisp
functions they desire and save local images.  The core files needed to
build GCL from C are my primary concern here.  I feel they should
follow the model which works well in the C world, namely read-only
code accessible through a well defined API.  It would be some world if
people patched gcc for each software project :-).

Mark, you might want to take a look at the way Debian does this as
outlined in the debian/rules file of the Debian package.  You can
likely follow the smaller 'patch.nosave' route if your platforms are
confined to amd64,i386,sparc,s390,arm,m68k,ppc.  Tim, would it be
possible to put in some configure like option to the build which could
select the GCL's alternate image creation mechanism as I've outlined
in an earlier email?  That way the Debian package can dispense with
all patches.

To refresh our memory, here is the patch application code from
debian/rules:

=============================================================================
ARCHT:=$(shell dpkg --print-architecture)
ifeq ($(ARCHT),ia64)
NO_SAVE_SYS:=t
endif
ifeq ($(ARCHT),mips)
NO_SAVE_SYS:=t
endif
ifeq ($(ARCHT),mipsel)
NO_SAVE_SYS:=t
endif
ifeq ($(ARCHT),hppa)
NO_SAVE_SYS:=t
endif
ifeq ($(ARCHT),alpha)
NO_SAVE_SYS:=t
endif

ifeq ($(ARCHT),powerpc)
NO_STRIP:=--exclude=axiom
endif

debian/patches_applied: 
	! [ -e debian/patches_unapplied ] || patch -p0 <debian/patch.all
	! [ -e debian/patches_unapplied ] || [ "$(NO_SAVE_SYS)" = "" ] || patch -p0 <debian/patch.save
	! [ -e debian/patches_unapplied ] || [ "$(NO_SAVE_SYS)" != "" ] || patch -p0 <debian/patch.nosave
	rm -f debian/patches_unapplied
	touch $@

Tim, if you'd like me to propose an axiom configure script, I'd be
happy to do so.

Camm, Mark,

I'm sure the patch issue is clear to both of you but I'm feeling 
a bit lost over what the issues are, what flaws you are trying to
correct, what your suggestions are and what the options you
are suggesting imply. Camm, could you explain it at a more
3rd grade level? (I guess the coffee isn't strong enough this 
morning). I'm not familiar with Debian. I'm not clear how Axiom's
socket code is supposed to get put into GCL without change. I'm
fairly certain (but willing to be convinced) that "configure" is
not going to work with the Axiom build (I read the docs, wrote an
example, and abandoned the approach last year).

Hello,

I think, at least for gcl 2.5.2, you should keep as much patches as
possible:

The following aren't system specific:

gcl-2.5.2.cmpnew.cmpcall.lsp.patch
gcl-2.5.2.cmpnew.cmpflet.lsp.patch
gcl-2.5.2.o.cmpaux.c.patch
gcl-2.5.2.o.main.c.patch
gcl-2.5.2.o.package.d.patch
gcl-2.5.2.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch
gcl-2.5.2.unixport.makefile.patch

Those two are linux specific, you should write the equivalent for
FreeBSD:

gcl-2.5.2.h.linux.defs.patch
gcl-2.5.2.h.linux.h.patch

That's said, GCL 2.6.1 integrates all necessary changes, so it might be
wise to start from this release.

For noweb, the patches are system independent and should be kept.

I hope it helps,
Yours,
d.

Actually, I've been muttering to myself about that.
There is no longer a reason why we need to set the AXIOM variable first.
If you just incanted something like:
make SYS=linux
then the makefile could construct the correct system. I'll test this
as soon as I can and consider making the change.

Hello TeXmacs hackers,

You'll find latest tm_axiom.c at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=axiom  (Axiom_texmacs section).

Latest release (1.0.2) fixes some typing issues. From Readme.txt:

1) Change default )set messages autoload off
2) eliminate the display of the initial output from Axiom up
   to the first prompt. See writing=0 in source. Change
   writing=1 to display Axiom startup messages.
3) TeX to LaTex conversions. Axiom generates TeX, texmacs
   accepts only a limited subset of LaTex. The following
   changes correct errors in texmacs display of Axiom output.
3a) convert \root{n} \of {x} to \sqrt[n]{x}
    e.g.  fixes display of x**(1/3)
3b) Sutor's linebreaker code has been incorporated



Regarding backward compatibility with old proprietary NAG Axiom, I
attempt a summary:

 - some people (like me) are not willing, neither have the access to a
   NAG Axiom, in order to support it

 - other people (like Tim) would like to support it but can't for
   licensing issues

 - other people have suggested that NAG Axiom has already an interface


>From other contributions, it seems that the most simple solution is
probably to duplicate TeXmacs/Axiom interface:

 - keep old, NAG Axiom compatible, tm_axiom.c in a separate directory
   and duplicate necesary launch script (with a menu entry "Session>NAG
   Axiom")

 - use latest tm_axiom.c as default Axiom session.


If you don't agree with this solution, then it seems that only latest,
free, Axiom will be supported in TeXmacs by Axiom people.

Yours,
d.

There are some additional files added ("EXTRAS= ...."). How general
to GCL are those files, or are they AXIOM-only? Could a general GCL
distribution have those files with no untoward side effects?

Does GCL 2.6.1 have the EXTRA= files?

> For noweb, the patches are system independent and should be kept.

I've added the patches to FreeBSD's noweb port, so the AXIOM port
can depend on that rather than carrying its own. Will the noweb
maintainers accept the patches for future releases?

Having a "configure" script does not mean using autoconf and the like.

We could just have a _hand written_ configure.pamphlet that just setup
necessary environment en print a nice message:

"Please type:
  export AXIOM=/.../mnt/linux
and then type:
  make
You can now have a loooong coffee. :)"

That would be excellent, thank you! It would also be nice if there was
a way to tell the build where the final install point of the code was,
so you could do a "make SYS=FreeBSD PREFIX=/usr/local" to get the a build
that is ready for /usr/local/*. Or something :-).

I found that :-).

I already have a working port of GCL-2.5.3 for FreeBSD, and I'm trying
hard to make _that_ do the job, by bringing over patches from AXIOM
as they prove necessary.

I think I'm going to proceed further by making a GCL-CURRENT(2.7.1?)
port, and trying to use that.

I'm being bull-headed; I'm trying to make these packages with as little
"baggage" as possible, so I want GCL to use the existing GMP port,
rather than bringing its own (nearly there), using existing (fixed)
noweb, GCL, binutils etc. The more I get this right, the more I can
unencumber the build, and potentially speed it up for the FreeBSD
ports-building cluster.

Am I making sense? :-)

Mark,

If you go to line 1116 or so in the root Makefile.pamphlet
there is a GCLVERSION variable. In theory you should only
have to set this variable to GCL-2.5.3, put the gcl-2.5.3.tar.gz
file in the zips subdirectory, set the AXIOM variable and type make.

Tim

I'd like to see the situation where the lisp compiler is completely
external to the AXIOM build, so that the AXIOM build does not build
its own lisp, rather it uses one athat is already present. Likewise
for tools such as noweb.

I like the .pamphlet files, in that they give the same sort of flexibility
as a configure script. It would be _great_ if the build system had
a way fo doing some configuring on the command line (or ENVvars, or
whatever).

I'm playing with checked out sources right now from the CVS repo. I'm
assuming that those are 2.7.1?

Mark,

Axiom actually doesn't know anything about its location but I can 
"hardcode" the path in the startup from the makefile. This would
eliminate the AXIOM variable completely. I'll look into it.

Tim

I totally agree with Camm proposal. And keeping the current
configuration would be a nobrainer, just put a gcl-2.6.1.tgz in the
zips/ directory.

The only "issue" I see is that Tim is opposed to any kind of configure
script. We could add a 'make external-gcl' target.

Camm, apparently ftp.gnu.org is back. Could you put a copy of latest
stable GCL there?

Yours,
d.

Would that mean that it could compile anywhere and subequently run
anywhere?

Greetings!

First of all, Tim, none of this pertains to 'flaws' in axiom IMHO, but
rather current weaknesses in GCL, which can nevertheless thankfully be
overcome without too much work.

There are two issues:

1) To use an externally installed GCL:
        a) One has no access to unixport/makefile for the purposes of
           patching the link command line generating raw_gcl and
           adding the EXTRAS of sockio-c.o and cfuns-c.o.  Instead,
           one can make use of GCL's compiler::link function to do the
           same within lisp from an externally installed GCL.  This
           happens at the 'lisp' image creation stage, and the syntax
           is:
                (compiler::link 
                        nil 
                        ;;;
                        ;;; an empty list of compiled lisp module pathnames
                        ;;;
                        "${OUT}/lisp" 
                        ;;;
                        ;;; the output image pathname
                        ;;;
                        "(setq compiler::*default-system-p* t)" 
                        ;;;
                        ;;; init code to run after the lisp modules' init;
                        ;;; *default-system-p* is explained below
                        ;;;
                        "${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/libspad.a")
                        ;;;
                        ;;; extra objects and libs to link in via ld
                        ;;;
  
        b) One wants to be able to save a local image (lisp, bootsys,
        depsys, interpsys) and still be able to access pertinent files 
        in the GCL tree, e.g. collectfn (now renamed to
        gcl_collectfn), and cmpinclude.h if compiling with :system-p
        t, as is required at present on 5 GCL architectures.  GCL now
        keeps a persistent *system-directory* variable to enable
        finding these files.  Hence these two patches, with comments
        interspersed:

2) Currently on ia64, mips(el), alpha, and hppa, GCL cannot save
   system images with loaded compiled lisp object files (.o files).
   On these systems, GCL must use compiler::link to make images
   containing compiled lisp object files.  One can also use this
   method on other systems including i386, but it is not necessary.
   Eventually we hope the necessity for this step will go away.  To
   achieve this will require modifications to the BFD library for
   these platforms, either upstream, or via a GCL patch.

   Luckily the alternate image creation method is almost transparent
   to the user.  In fact, perhaps with your help, it can be made
   completely transparent, and these separate arch-dependent image
   building steps can be avoided.  The idea is that one has a normal
   GCL session, compiling files, processing other input, etc., and
   instead of executing save-system to dump the image, passes a list
   of the compiled lisp object modules to compiler::link together with
   whatever other interpreted initialization code was run in the
   session.  compiler::link will then build a 'raw' image by linking
   the lisp objects to the gcl objects with ld, and then feed this
   image as input the interpreted code already run in the current
   session.  Any invocations of 'load' in this second run
   automatically bypasses the actual load step, and instead merely
   initializes the compiled lisp object which is already linked into
   the running executable.  At the end of this input, the image is
   saved with save-system.

   We made an improvement in this procedure for axiom, and that was
   the si::*collect-binary-modules* setup.  Basically, one sets this
   variable to t at the beginning of a session, and the variable
   si::*binary-modules* will contain a list of all loaded binary
   compiled lisp modules at the session's end, ready to pass as is to
   compiler::link.  If in addition I could figure out a reliable way
   of saving the input stream for rerunning later, then I could simply
   redirect save-system on these troublesome architectures to a call
   to compiler::link and all would be transparent.  

   For compiled lisp object modules to be ld linkable, they must be
   compiled with the :system-p flag set to t.  This can most easily be
   achieved by setting compiler::*default-system-p* to t.

   As it is now, the following is needed on ia64, mips(el), alpha, and 
   hppa, with comments interspersed:

With this setup, axiom can compile with externally installed GCL on
(with a slight bit of anticipation) all 11 Debian architectures and
amd64.   A case can clearly be made that GCL should handle all this
arch specific stuff itself, but this is the reality at present.  I'm
certainly open to suggestions.  I could provide a lisp variable
indicating that the current arch cannot save loaded .o files if
desired -- this would obviate the need for a separate determination of
the architecture in a configure script.   Or, since all your image
generation code is nicely packaged into an external file, I could
write a superset function to save-system and compiler::link for use
in all cases.  The only tricky part in complete transparency is saving
input fed in not from a file, but via a terminal, and presering the
modules list across multiple invocations of load, save, rerun.  Things
can definitely be improved, but so far there has been slight demand,
and the existing per application work-arounds have proved adequate.
And GCL has more pressing ANSI issues to attend to.

Anyway, the more important patches from axiom's point of view are,
IMHO, the 1) issues.  With these applied, axiom no longer need
maintain a subbuild of GCL, at least on i386 and the like. Possibly
going further, the 2) issues could either be applied in all cases,
only the needed cases, or not at all, leaving it up to debian/rules to
do for Debian distros only.  Whatever you feel is best.

Take care,

Camm has come up with a proposal that looks as though it does this

In theory, every FreeBSD build will be a one-time build, as that is the
way the ports system works.

That is fair enough. I can make sure that the FreeBSD GCL is built
properly for AXIOM, etc.

Hmmm.

Hmm. Then it makes sense to check it into your tree and fork it properly,
no?

So you are going to check them into the axiom tree and essentially borg
them, right? :-)

Camm did this :-)

I checked it out of the CVS repo (HEAD).

re: making sense.

Yes and no. 

It would be nice if Axiom ran on any common lisp without changes but
there is no common lisp spec for sockets so every lisp will have to be
rebuilt with socket support.

Furthermore the lisp build is actually just a few minutes of the whole
build so the "overhead" of rebuilding is low. And, in fact, the lisp
will never be rebuilt if you don't change versions so it is a one-time
event.

Still further, having Axiom do a custom build of the lisp ensures that
we have a working version that is known to be correct.  Running on
random lisp images can be problematic since Axiom sets up things like
memory layouts (see the src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet). These are
needed because otherwise Axiom will run inefficiently due to consing.
Other lisps will require similar tuning.

Axiom also runs faster after the "second compile". That is, if you do
a build and then rebuild the src/interp directory Axiom will run
faster. There are .fn files in the INT directory and these contain
type information which GCL can use to "fast path" the system
calls. They are generated at the first compile and used during the
second. It is "in plan" to force a rebuild of src/interp in order to
build the fastest possible image.

The noweb image is changed from the original and is "in plan" to
have much deeper changes to support new pamphlet/booklet features. I
talked to Norman Ramsey, the author of noweb, and he wants to keep his
distribution as simple as possible so changes aren't going to migrate
back to the noweb distribution. It probably won't be named noweb in
the future so we don't collide with Norman's work.

Upcoming but not yet part of the build is a deeper use of other packages
like ADVI. These packages will have modifications that are almost 
certainly not going to get picked up by the general distribution. In
particular, with ADVI, we need to build a "browser-like" hyperlink 
ability and a front-end that can handle table-of-contents and outline
forms. Axiom will have thousands of pamphlet files that are cross-referencing.
ADVI is going to have to know what a pamphlet file is, how to build one, 
how to walk one, and how to move among them. Thus there is an Axiom-ADVI
in the future plan.

It would be great if you could just fire up a common lisp, load Axiom and go.
We could do that now with the current subset if some careful planning and
rewriting were done. But the current system is only about 1/3 the size of
what it will be next year and future plans call for even more complexity.

However, it is good to review the patches and see if they can be back-ported.
I've only patched the lisp as a last resort. Perhaps you can figure out ways
to eliminate the need to patch (e.g. how to add EXTRAS).

I downloaded GCL-2.5.3 last night (the last tar.gz) and I also downloaded
the CVS. Where did you find 2.7.1?

Axiom can be compiled in any directory. Once the compile completes you
copy the mnt subdirectory to (yourpath) and then set AXIOM=(yourpath)/mnt/linux
(or (yourpath)/mnt/freebsd). Everything else can be erased.

The src directory is untouched during the build. The INT directory
contains system-independent, machine-built files (e.g. lisp code), the
OBJ directory contains system-dependent, machine-built files (e.g. the
.o files) and MNT contains the "shipped system"). You can erase int
and obj at any time.  They exist to speed up rebuilding and to hold
optimization information (e.g. the .fn files). After the system build
you can erase everything except MNT anywhere and MNT can move anywhere.

Also You can clip off SRC and ZIPS, reset the Axiom variable, and
build for a new system. You can copy external packages into ZIPS, make
minor mods to the top level Makefile.pamphlet (e.g. the GCLVERSION
variable), type make, and use the new code.

Originally this scheme came about because I built Axiom for about a dozen
different systems. In the first build you set it up as:

    src       int       obj/sys1       mnt/sys1
-------------------------------------------------
|        |         |              |             |
|        |         |              |             |

The make fills in the INT subdirectory (as well as OBJ and MNT for sys1).
For the second and subsequent systems you NFS mount empty file systems over
SRC and INT on sys2 thus:

    NFS       NFS
    src       int       obj/sys2       mnt/sys2
-------------------------------------------------
|        |         |              |             |
|        |         |              |             |

Now you can type make and it will rebuild OBJ and MNT for sys2 using the
system-independent work done for sys1.

Axiom used to take about 3 weeks of continuous build time to build from
scratch (well, not scratch. you needed a running Axiom). INT and OBJ
reduced the cost of making changes down to a couple hours at most.
Even now on a 2Ghz, 1GB system it takes a couple hours. This scheme 
reduces minor rebuilds to a couple minutes. If I had the hardware 
available and NFS running I could significantly reduce build times for
ports.

I agree.  In the case of Gentoo Linux, some special configure options
are needed to build gcl.  So to do an axiom ebuild, it would be
necessary to make changes and maintain them across Axiom releases.

Out of curiosity, what are the objections to a configure/make style
arrangement like Maxima's?  Perhaps something other than autoconf could
be used, a simpler system that just handled checking for the right
tools?  Failing that, a make external-gcl would be very nice.
 
One of these days I'll work on an Axiom ebuild for gentoo, but the
initial build attempt failed when I tried it a while back and my
machine is down now.  Maybe it would work, but IIRC it failed on the
gcl build, which has always been a headache on Gentoo.

Ok, I'm a little confused again. Must be my day for it. Lets see if I
can explain my confusion and then someone can clear it up for me.

It appears that there is a goal to have an "external build" of gcl.
The motivation seems to be that if someone already has gcl installed
then they could use the already installed gcl rather than build a new one.

I don't understand why this is important. After all the point of the gcl
build isn't to have an installed lisp but to build an axiom image. When
the axiom build finishes the lisp image is erased. Axiom will build on
many common lisps.

Axiom uses some functions which are not standard common lisp. The socket
code is custom code for Axiom. Every lisp we use will have to include that
socket code. The code isn't useful to anyone else so it should not be part
of any standard lisp distribution.

Axiom has to know details of each common lisp it is built upon. It is 
important that we study each lisp in detail in order to optimize axiom
for the best performance. This means that makefiles are going to be
sensitive to lisp we build. For instance, in the GCL build we explicitly
set memory parameters to avoid consing. CMUCL, CLISP, Franz, etc are going
to have different issues.

The current design uses a "standard distribution" unpacked from tar.gz
files that are easily replaced and are exact copies distributed by the
external projects. The tar.gz files allow us to ensure that we have a
"verified version" of each lisp. If we use an installed lisp we won't
have any way to guarantee which version of lisp we used. The user could
have strange intermediate versions and the "version number" doesn't 
capture all the necessary information.

I don't understand why it is important to use an already installed
lisp image.  It seems likely to be yet-another-source-of-trouble
like the X library issues. What am I missing?

Tim
