Subject: compiling in Axiom

Hello,

I used AXIOM a number of years ago, and I think at that time I understood 
the difference between a  *.as  and *.spad   file, but have since 
forgotten.

I had written  *.as  files.

Recently I tried to run some of my old code unsuccessfully in the modern 
AXIOM.
I used to use the command line
     axiomxl -laxllib -Fx filename.as
although I understand the this method of producing a standalone executable
is no longer supported (no   axiomxl  command)
So I started the interpreter and typed
     )co filename.as
and got an error message saying
"Only AXIOM source files with file extensions .as, .ao, .al, or .spad
       can be compiled."

My file WAS named  something.as   and although my syntax in the file may 
need modernizing, I got the impression that the compiler didn't look into 
file beyond the name.

Can you tell me what I am doing wrong and what would need to be done to 
get on old  *.as  file to compile in the modern AXIOM ?
Thanks,

>From all the panaxiom flavours (to my knowledge) currently only FriCAS
allows the connection to Aldor, i.e. compilation of .as files and use of
the result inside FriCAS.

For that, you would have to compile libaxiom.al locally on your
computer, it's not in the distribution. But also for FriCAS it is
currently in a "transition state" (I would say). My fricas-aldor-local
branch (https://github.com/hemmecke/fricas/commits/fricas-aldor-local)
should work together with the latest aldor
(https://github.com/pippijn/aldor), but I didn't have time to really
check everything and integrate it back into FriCAS mainline. Aldor is
currently getting a lot of patches and it's a bit hard to keep track.

Anyway, it's not possible to use the aldor compiler and produce stand
alone programs that use the Axiom library.

Hi, Camm --

Should we expect 2.6.8 and 2.6.9 to support ANSI builds (i.e., using
configure option --enable-ansi)?

   Greetings!  The GCL team is happy to announce a pair of stable releases
   at

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/gcl_2.6.8.tar.gz
   and
   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/gcl_2.6.9.tar.gz

   Please also see the homepage and release notes at

   http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl.

   The 2.6.8 release represents several years worth of fixes and
   enhancements, notably a great extension of GCL's native object file
   relocation support.  

   2.6.9 is released concurrently as it contains a number of structural
   improvements which, while passing all our tests, may cause issues for
   some people.  These improvements are chiefly a two word cons, immediate
   fixnum support, word sized fixnums (64bits on 64bit machines), and a
   'dynamic maxpage' implementation, which removes all compile time limits
   to the heap size and auxiliary typing and marking tables.  2.6.9 will
   attempt to manage the heap given the apparent constraints of the running
   system, with the goal of eliminating allocation failures and handling
   out of memory conditions in advance with a modicum of grace.  As this
   involves a runtime startup probe of brk, which has varying degrees of
   significance in different operating systems, one might still experience
   overallocation of memory (notably on hurd).  In such cases, 

   gcl -eval '(si::set-log-maxpage-bound x)'

   will limit the heap to 2^x bytes as a workaround.

   All gcl, maxima, acl2, axiom, and hol88 builds and self tests pass for
   the following platforms, with noted exceptions(*) itemized below:

   debian: amd64 armel armhf hurd-i386 i386 ia64 kfreebsd-amd64
   kfreebsd-i386 mips mipsel powerpc s390 s390x sparc

   debian-ports: alpha hppa m68k powerpcspe ppc64 sh4 sparc64 x32

   macosx, windows

   *exceptions

   1) all systems use native object relocation by default now but ia64 and
   ppc64, which use dlopen.  Thus there is a typical limit of 1024 files
   that can be loaded, and the current acl2 build exceeds this limit.  As
   this bound is runtime configurable with root access, this is not an
   insurmountable obstacle.

   2) kfreebsd-i386 systems do not appear to allow one to brk more than
   500M of memory, and the acl2 certification process needs 1Gb.  A
   solution here is as yet unknown but may be forthcoming shortly.

   3) windows builds have been performed on win95.  There is an as yet
   unidentified runtime error running the 2.6.9 images on win7.  More
   information here will be forthcoming shortly.

   Windows installers can be found at ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl.

   4) macosx builds have been tested on snow leopard.  More recent versions
   appear to have a linker bug which prevents configure from detecting the
   provided profil() routine.  A workaround here should be to 

   echo "#undef NO_PROFILE >>h/config.h" 

   after configure and before make.


   GCL has moved to the git version control system.  The 2.6.8 and 2.6.9
   branches and tags are identical in cvs and git.  Henceforward,
   modifications will be made to git only.  As of the present writing, git
   contains a merge of experimental into master, and a port of most 2.6.x
   improvements into master.  This will form the basis of a 2.7.0 release
   sometime in the future.

   For those unfamiliar with git:

   git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gcl.git
   cd gcl
   git checkout master, or git checkout Version_2_6_9, etc.
   cd gcl
   ./configure && make

   git can of course provide much more.  I'm currently using Egg, an emacs
   interface to git, with increasing success.  Merging, logging, bisecting,
   branching, and uploading appear much simpler.  I recommend this tool to
   would-be gcl contributors.

   Feedback as always most welcome!

Thank you, Don.  If there's a complete list of platforms for which
ANSI builds are expected to work for 2.6.9, and if possible one for
2.6.8 as well, I'd be interested.  In particular, it would be nice to
know whether 2.6.9 ANSI builds on Linux are expected to work.

Thanks.  I'm afraid my question wasn't clear (sorry).  I know about
the --enable-ansi switch (but I appreciate the information about what
has been seen to work with it).  However, in past years, ACL2 failed
badly when build on top of a GCL that had been built with that switch.
The good news is that in recent months I've worked with Camm to iron
out most or all such issues.  What I don't know, though, is whether
fixes for those issues were incorporated into 2.6.8, 2.6.9, both
(which is my guess), or neither (perhaps waiting for 2.7.0 to
incorporate fixes).  Since over the years I have sometimes experienced
GCL errors that are intermittent, I figured I'd just ask rather than
do testing that could be incomplete.

Anyhow, I hope that clarifies.  Thanks to everyone who is contributing
to GCL!  I'm very happy to see the progress.

Regards,
Matt

   On x86_64 linux, I built gcl 2.6.8, and 2.6.9 with

   ./configure --enable-readline --enable-ansi 
   --prefix=/usr/local/gcl-2.6.8 (9)

   and maxima with

   export GCL_ANSI=y
   ./configure --enable-gcl --prefix=/usr/local/maxima-5.31.0-gcl-2.6.8 (9) 
   --with-gcl=/usr/local/bin/gcl-2.6.8 (9)

   Maxima passed all tests, for each of 2.6.8 and 2.6.9

   I'm not sure what the flag does, but the doc says.

     --enable-ansi builds a large gcl aiming for ansi compliance

   I built Maxima with the latest stable versions gcl,ccl,cmucl,clisp,sbcl,ecl,
   and gcl (2.6.8 and 2.6.9 ) is the only one that still fails to load asdf.

On x86_64 linux, I built gcl 2.6.8, and 2.6.9 with

./configure --enable-readline --enable-ansi 
--prefix=/usr/local/gcl-2.6.8 (9)

and maxima with

export GCL_ANSI=y
./configure --enable-gcl --prefix=/usr/local/maxima-5.31.0-gcl-2.6.8 (9) 
--with-gcl=/usr/local/bin/gcl-2.6.8 (9)

Maxima passed all tests, for each of 2.6.8 and 2.6.9

I'm not sure what the flag does, but the doc says.

  --enable-ansi builds a large gcl aiming for ansi compliance

I built Maxima with the latest stable versions gcl,ccl,cmucl,clisp,sbcl,ecl,
and gcl (2.6.8 and 2.6.9 ) is the only one that still fails to load asdf.

Matt, AFAICS, all the acl2/ansi work is in both 2.6.8 and 2.6.9.  These
are (approximately)

symbol exports
:dynamic-extent decls
fast #= support
dispatch macro char fix
with-standard-io-syntax

In addition, one feature requested by Jared is in 2.6.9 only:

-- command line argument support

Please let me know if I've forgotten anything.

Take care,

Just wanted to point out here that the Debian/Ubuntu gcl package
actually ships 4 images:

Cltl1
Cltl1 with gprof support
ANSI
ANSI with gprof support

When the package is installed (gcl ... .deb), these images are toggled
with the environment variables

GCL_ANSI
GCL_PROF

When set, gcl should report what image is running in the startup banner.


If you build your own gcl, you are naturally getting just one image, so
the GCL_ANSI environment variable does nothing.

maxima requires ansi, up until now acl2 required cltl1 (now can use
either).  If I recall axiom can run on either as well.

I suppose I should look at this at some point.  I never really
understood it.  I always wondered why it had to be so complex, and what
was wrong with make.

Hi Tim!  Please excuse the large cc list, but this has come up

We have attempted a remote gdb session, and will continue, but gdb
raw_pre_gcl.exe is not even getting to main, so I suspect something
about the static memory setup.  2.6.9 works on Wine, and I'm taking this
as evidence that my use of wine to emulate windows is only reliable up
through WinXP.  Alas, Don cannot get permission for remote vnc access.

You did very helpfully provide me with vnc access some time ago, and
write now:

Alas, I know nothing of Windows.  Perhaps someone here can help?  Does
anyone else already have vnc access to a win vista/mingw machine or
higher?

I've already tried a stab at this in the release announcement, but just
a note that ANSI works and is available wherever gcl is available in any
flavor.   This includes a very large list of GNU/Linux and BSD
distributions/processor combinations  -- gcl even still supports Motorola
68k processors -- windows and mac.  

Smooth support is very correlated to 24/7 remote access to a development
machine.  This inevitably rises and falls as tastes change over time.
I've taken the perspective that if such a machine cannot be provided,
then the platform either does not want to be supported or is dying.
There is no sense to waste limited human time chasing such situations,
but for the record here are some of the latest developments:

last available hppa machine dropped by the gcc compile farm.
one remaining ia64 machine has no gdb support
solaris available through a kind friend sporadically on request, and at
  considerable personal expense to him.
no access to latest macosx (2?) version(s)
no access to latest 3 windows versions or working emulators.
sporadic access by request to a few of the linux debian-ports targets

UTF8 isn't 'critical', but not having it means that interfacing with
file systems & documents that utilize UTF8 is quite difficult.

   UTF8 isn't 'critical', but not having it means that interfacing with
   file systems & documents that utilize UTF8 is quite difficult.

Henry, I don't know if the following answers your question, but I do
suspect you and Camm have different ideas of what 'handling' utf8
means. It may be that for your purposes, it handles them well enough.

This is from gcl 2.6.9 ansi from the debian testing repo:

>(with-open-file (=CF=87-stream "=CE=B1=CE=B2=CE=B3.txt" :direction :outp=
ut :if-exists :supersede :if-does-not-exist :create) (format =CF=87-strea=
m "=CE=B1=CE=B2=CE=B3"))

NIL

>(with-open-file (=CF=87-stream "=CE=B1=CE=B2=CE=B3.txt" :direction :inpu=
t) (read-line =CF=87-stream nil nil))

"=CE=B1=CE=B2=CE=B3"
T

>(coerce (symbol-name '=CF=87) 'list)

(#\\317 #\\207)

SBCL, by contrast, yields:

* (coerce (symbol-name '=CF=87) 'list)

(#\GREEK_CAPITAL_LETTER_CHI)

In case the mail server or client corrupts the message, gcl is
interning a symbol with a non-ascii char and it is creating a file
with non-ascii chars in its name and successfully writing to and
reading from that file.

I have been using maxima+{gcl,ecl,sbcl,cmucl} plus this hack

https://github.com/leo-butler/utf8-hack

to use utf8 chars in maxima. This works fine in emacs and (sort of) in
xmaxima.  Wxmaxima does not display wide chars correctly and I have
not chased a solution.

* -------------------------------------------- b9c3f3e9 zero firstword in set_type_of macro to handle C stack objects
* ------ origin/Version_2_6_9pre Version_2_6_9 b75be097 fix allocate functions

Primarily this fixes the builds on win7 and higher, and macosx 10.7 and
higher.  There is also a fix to an obscure bug revealed by acl2, as well
as a syntax error blocking fricas trunk.  Heap sizes are also dynamic on
windows and macosx, making available much more memory.

I'd like to release this ASAP.  However, I've been informed by the
fricas people that 2.6.9 is much slower for them than 2.6.8.  I haven't
had the time to look into this, and have not experienced this with other
software.  Nevertheless, if someone might isolate any performance
degradation issues in the next few days, I'll try to get a fix in to
2.6.10.
