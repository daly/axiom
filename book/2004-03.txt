In general Debian strives to change upstream source as little as
possible.  That said, there is no general mechanism (at least known to
me) to dynamically update a users environment/path after a package
install, so packages generally have to cooperate on items like the
name of the executables, and these typically must go in a directory in
the standard PATH.

I'll make sure the link is available for the texmacs maintainer to use
where approrpiate.

Hi Tim!  This stuff is really great!

How does one find a list of all the branches?

Subject: which branches exist

Camm, 

There are two ways to know what branches exist. The mechanical way
is to do the following:

tla my-default-archive axiom@tenkan.org--axiom
tla get axiom--release--1
cd axiom--release--1--patch-7
tla branches

which will tell you what branches exist. The second way is to ask me.
The current branches are:

axiom--acl2              the Axiom-ACL2 merge effort
axiom--book              the axiom book and other documentation efforts
axiom--cats              the computer algebra test suite (CATS)
axiom--crystal           the crystal assistant software
axiom--graphics          the graphics code for axiom
axiom--release           the "official" main trunk (mirrored to savannah)

There will be other branches as I continue to decouple my local 
development swamp. I did a bit of work on the book, the acl2, and the
crystal branches this weekend. 

I have several other efforts underway in my local swamp to be exported.
Planned (but not yet created) near-term branches are:

axiom--advi              active documentation with embedded axiom
axiom--aldor             recovery of aldor support
axiom--algebra           a set of algebra developments with others
axiom--beowulf           parallel algorithm support on beowulf
axiom--booklet           meta-organization of axiom's pamphlet structure
axiom--cmucl             the next common lisp port
axiom--coerce            Nic's phd work on exact coercions
axiom--fortran           recovery of the fortran library support
axiom--hypertex          recovery of hypertex functionality
axiom--proviso           pervasive proviso support, including indefinites
axiom--lattice           tools to make the axiom math structure visisble
axiom--literate          new literate programming tools
axiom--magnus            infinite group theory work
axiom--openmath          recovery of the openmath interface
axiom--science           science support (eg Poincare groups for Field Theory)
axiom--simplify          simplification research
axiom--web               possible grid-web interface with Paul Wang's group 
axiom--zlc               a zero-learning curve interface

If I work on things like the book locally no-one else can help with
the efforts. Making the branches public allows others to contribute.
CVS on savannah would be too hard to manage so I set up a GNU-Arch
server (which is currently mirrored by David Mentre).

David,

Check out a copy of the book, see if you can extract it, and see
if it TeXs properly in your environment. From there it would be
useful to either proofread the first 4 chapters vs the book or
pick a later chapter and try to fix up the tex.

I would really like to look into some particular chapters, but havn't
managed to install tla on my SuSE 8.0 linux due to libc incompatibilities.
I would like to have a try on the symmetric function chapter, hope to be

Bertfried,

tla should compile on SUSE.
If you get the latest update from savannah there is a tla tar gzip
file in the zips directory called tla-1.1.tar.gz

If you do:

tar -zxf tla-1.1.tar.gz
cd tla-1.1
mkdir =build
cd =build
../confiure --prefix /usr/local/tla
make
make install

you should have a runnable version. Let me know if this fails
and I'll send a note to the GNU-Arch mailing list (please save
your console so I can report the bug).

Still not working I'm afraid. Starting from scratch again with no

% tla my-default-archive axiom@tenkan.org--axiom
% tla get axiom--book--1

I've tried reading http://regexps.srparish.net/tutorial-tla/arch.html but

Either you use tla with following command (I suppose you have a mirror
or registered Tim's archive on your local tla setting): 

  tla abrowse -A axiom@tenkan.org--axiom

that gives you:

axiom@tenkan.org--axiom
  axiom
    axiom--acl2
      axiom--acl2--1
        base-0 .. patch-2
 
    axiom--book

        base-0 .. patch-2
 
    axiom--release
      axiom--release--1
        base-0 .. patch-7

Or either you use a web browser and get:

  http://axiom.tenkan.org/current/axiom/.listing

that gives you:
axiom--acl2
axiom--book
axiom--cats
axiom--crystal
axiom--graphics
axiom--release


Tla 1.1 is available as a debian package named tla.

OK, this worked out. It gave a warning "no root <<*>> defined" or such but
actually TeXed the book.
	"> make" did even produce an AXIOM, just for curiosity I tried it
and it came up with build date March 2 2004, so its new. It computes, but
I don't know what is broken. It compiled for several hours (PIII 700MHz)
without problems, but I had to leave at 11pm the institute, which is
required for security reasons (@#$%#$#!!), so I cannot tell when it failed.

Q1:	If I would like to make changes to the book, how to proceed,
change it locally and send you a diff or writing a file which explains
what to change (work for you, most likely bad)
Q2:	Is there a policy for the TeX? I saw very very outdated TeX
commands like \root{x}\of{y} and \over and such things which seriously
interfere with newer TeX and LaTeX standards. Should there be \mathbb
fonts for real, complex numbers etc.

Q3:	Main question, is it possible to pipe files through axiom, so that
is reads from a file and writes its (TeX) output into a file? Maple has eg
a switch -l which allows to process files and maple interprets only code
inbetween special \begin{mapleinput}...\\end{mapleoutput} tags. It would
be really exquisite to have such a facility and to use AXIOM to produce
(most of) the book itself. This would reduce the possibility to make
errors in copying axiom output into the TeX file and would guarantee, that
in the book exactly that is displayed what AXIOM actually does. If AXIOM
only can process files, a perl frontend could do the rest, I would
recomment three possible environments

1)  \AXIOMsilent{command}
2)  \AXIOMoutputonly{command}
2)  \AXIOM{command}
[of course this can/should be done as \begin...\end environment]

The fist should issue an AXIOM command and ignore in the TeX file the
output (so that internal things can be done and the TeX file keeps
clean, eg:
	\AXIOMsilent{)set time on}

The second should issue an AXIOM command that is not recorded in the TeX
file, but the output is shown, this hides AXIOMs technicalities away from
the user, eg:
        \AXIOMoutput{draw(...)} or \AXIOMoutput{integrate(sin,x)}

The third tag should come up with the TeX output of the AXIOM command and
the corresponding AXIOM output for regular use and to be able to show the
reader what input caused the display to be shown.

	 Let me say, that you did an enormous work already right now to
make the book available in its present form. Great!

you should be able to run make on a partial build and it will restart
from where it stopped.

at the moment just send me the 

   diff -Naur (myversion.tex) (yourversion.tex)

and I'll merge them. The long term plan is to allow direct
edits to the file. First I have to figure out how to make
the arch server version writeable.

The TeX is standard TeX although not used much these days.
The \root{x}\of{y} form is actual Axiom output. You can see this
output by typing

  )set output tex on

at the Axiom console and then typing an equation.
We need to consider updating the TeX generator in Axiom.
Bill, David, and Joris have already complained about it.
It's on the list of things to do.

.....(snip).....

The entries in the book ARE actual output from Axiom.
Every Axiom command is surrounded by a
  \spadcommand{  }
TeX command and the output from Axiom has been pasted
back into the book. In fact, in the past the book's output
was generated this way and I have broken this facility.
Future plans will bring this back but in a much different
form that uses literate programming for uniformity.

extracting the book.tex from the book.pamphlet file. Thus, you
should be able to do:

cd axiom
make start                 <=== this makes the document command
cd src/doc
document book              <=== this extracts book.tex then latex book.tex

If this doesn't work I need to fix it.
Please let me know if this succeeds or fails.
Sometimes it is hard to know if things work because I have so many
things in the path locally.

Hello Tim,

Tim Daly writes:

> Do you happen to know how to make an arch server writeable remotely?

Yes, you should use sftp (secure ftp client of ssh). You put you public
ssh key (and maybe the key of all people you want to give write access)
on the server (in the .ssh/authorized_keys) and you use an sftp:// url
for the mirror.

For example, for my own archive I have:

  ## my local repository
David Mentre--2004-code
    /home/david/{archives}/2004-code

  ## its mirror on linux-france.org
David Mentre--2004-code-MIRROR
    sftp://linux-france.org/home/lf/dmentre/html/arch-ive


For more info, look at:

xli96,

20030614 is much too old. If possible you should build axiom
from cvs at

  http://www.nongnu.org/axiom/download.html

For pre-compiled binaries, the Debian package is up to date,
but unfortunately up to date binaries for other platforms are
yet available. The reason being that none of us have yet
cracked Savannah's new approach to uploading files to the
files section (too little time mostly, I think. :)

Thanks Tim!

Actually the linking is fine.  Its runtime.  sbrk(0) returns a random
address with each startup.  Thankfully setarch is working.  And I feel
it will be supported for a long time, as its required for Fedora's
emacs build too (just checked).

I'm just hoping that people don't start regarding us as 'old', both in
terms of people and code, and therefore assume there is nothing of
value that should be preserved by maintaining backward compatibility. 

Take care,

I've emailed directly to you answers to your questions to me, but I want to
thank you publicly for all your GCL efforts!

-- Matt

   Greetings!  GCL is fully functional on FC1 without global exec-shield
   shutoff provided one makes use of 'setarch'.  Built gcl and acl2
   binaries are in my home directory provided by J. Shapiro.

   GCL
   1) setarch i386 ./configure (optional --enable-dynsysgmp, etc.)
   2) setarch i386 make

   ACL2
   1) setarch i386 make lisp=gcl
   2) setarch i386 ./saved_acl2

   etc.

   If there is a way in which a program can internally, i.e. from within,
   do its own 'setarch' and one can explain this to me, I'd be happy to
   put it in GCL, configured in when appropriate.  Or if someone can post
   the sources to setarch.  At the moment, the most convenient thing
   would appear to be to provide an acl2 (or maxima, gcl, axiom...)
   wrapper script with the setarch i386 explicitly provided.

   Matt --

   1) Any chance to look over the acl2-2.7-8 deb?
   2) Did the compiler fix work for you?  It is committed. BTW, we just
      passed the clisp high water mark on Paul Dietz' random testers
      (size 1000/8) with no failures.  Will proceed to the 10,000 size
      case and report further, but in any case its looking quite solid.
      We may be alone with clisp in this measure of compiler robustness,
      and of course in GCL's case the compile is much more aggressive, to
      native code.  Congrats to all the many people who've helped with
      this release, which (hopefully) should be soon now.

   Take care,

Subject: Re: Fedora

I've already made a huge stink about it on the fedora list and the
basic response is "deal with it". It seems that the most recent
issue is that they also break JIT compilers (Java). 

In thinking about this I suspect that there is a hack around it.
GCL already gets information from the linker when it loads code.
There are two possible attacks. Either:

(a) don't use the system dynamic linker and link the .so files yourself
(b) look at the load map and find where the .so files were loaded

without success.

My system is a Mandrake 9.2.

The build starts with

make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/src/src/Makefile.pamphlet',

This is curious because I thought the top level sources 
were at src/src/axiom but something appears to want
src/src/Makefile which is too high in the path.

Send me the src/src/axiom/Makefile* files.

OK, I think my contact's suspicions are correct, and that nothing
local (setarch, -Wa,--execstack) turns off the brk
randomization. You're a fedora developer right?  Do you know if there
are plans to address this in later versions?  Should I write to Roland
directly?  If you do contact him, kindly ask him to also explain how
emacs unexec is made to work.

Subject: Latex line breaking in Axiom

FYI... it appears that Axiom can give SOME hints about line breaking.
The tex output includes a \: at the various "joints" in the output
such as between list items. So given [1,2,3], the output tex looks like:

$$
\left[
1, \: 2, \: 3
\right]

I just tried the CVS version also, with the same result - i.e. unable to 
compile fat_string.c -- see my mail with subject "Build trouble"

Please help!

According to previous messages seen on gcl-devel, this might be related
to previous errors during the configure step of gcl.

Could you post the content of lsp/gcl-2.6.1/config.log of your Axiom
compilation?

Apparently, there isn't the end of this file. In my own config.log, I
have after the above line ("Checking for buggy gcc version from
redhat"), I have:
configure:9772: result: no
configure:9875: creating ./config.status

Is this part really missing in your config.log?

If configure succeeded in creating config.status, you should have a
section:
#
# CONFIG_FILES section.
#
                                                                                                                                                            
# No need to generate the scripts if there are no CONFIG_FILES.
# This happens for instance when ./config.status config.h
if test -n "$CONFIG_FILES"; then
  # Protect against being on the right side of a sed subst in config.status.
  sed 's/,@/@@/; s/@,/@@/; s/,;t t$/@;t t/; /@;t t$/s/[\\&,]/\\&/g;

s,@SHELL@,/bin/sh,;t t
s,@PATH_SEPARATOR@,:,;t t

Could you send it, with all the "s,@PATH_SEPARATOR@,:,;t t" patterns
(until the CEOF line)?



As a side note, when compiling Axiom, it is always nice to make a full
transcript of the compilation by using the script command or by
compiling in an Emacs shell. Thus we can have the full compilation
commands and results.

It is always difficult to debug by emails. :)

unfortunately, this is a lot of stuff. But if you like, I mail it to

Thanks for the effort anyway. On my own, I'd be simply lost.

If your change would affect compile times for Axiom (for example),
then I (personally) would place a high value in it.

The recent improvements to GCL on Windows are making me anxious
to get back to looking at Axion for Windows.

You and the rest of the GCL team are doing great work!

Thank you.

While I haven't finished my tests, the changes are bound to help, at
least somewhat.  They are most prominent when the number of variables
is large.  This having been said, I have confirmed that this issue is
not responsible for the single longest step of the axiom compile, that
of EXPEXPAN.spad.

The slowness of the compilation of this file is almost entirely due to
to the repeated calls to 'lengthenvec' in category.spad.pamphlet.  If
any recall, this was involved in the hasCategory bug of last year.
The function has two basic methods for achieving the lengthening -- if
the array is adjustable, try to adjust it, otherwise replace with a
newly allocated one.  The former call to adjust array will in turn
simply allocate a new array unless the array passed to it is
'displaced' to another one (i.e. shares the same storage) large enough
to accommodate the lengthening, in which case there is no copying.  

I cannot discern when lengthenvec is passed a 'displaced' array and
when not.  I know this is done at least sometimes, as this was the
cause of the hasCategory bug.  The slowdown of EXPEXPAN.spad, however,
is because the passed arrays are *not* displaced, and are
length-incremented by one each call, basically doing a tight loop
allocating and copying a 1k array, then copying again into a 1025
length array, and so on up to very large numbers.  this churns the
garbage collector for relocatable blocks, a sign which I earlier
mistook for bignum integer generation.

One can usually implement an effective caching by doing something like
the following:

(defun lengthenvec (v n)
  (if (adjustable-array-p v) 
	(let ((disp (or (array-displacement v) (make-array (+ 1024 n)))))
		(when (> n (length disp))
			(setq disp (adjust-array disp (+ 1024 n))))
		(adjust-array v n :displaced-to disp))
    (replace (make-array n) v)))
;(defun lengthenvec (v n)
;  (if (adjustable-array-p v) (adjust-array v n)
;    (replace (make-array n) v)))

This does not work, as apparently there is already some displacement
in certain calls to this routine, with which this interferes.

Speaking of which, I cannot compile debugsys, at least as of my
20040128 tree.  Has there been recent work in this area?  

Anyway, suggestions appreciated.

Take care,

Subject: EXPEXPAN problem

Camm,

Excellent work. I think we can instrument the axiom calls to print
out which array type we are using during the compile. Since the behavior
happens every time and we now have a clue it shouldn't be too hard
to fix (of course, there is no such thing as a simple job).

re: debugsys. That image is only used to run interpreted versions of
axiom for deep debugging. This might be a case where it is needed.  I
haven't been maintaining debugsys because I haven't needed it so it
doesn't surprise me that it fails to build. The problem can't be deep
though as the debugsys build is just a copy of the standard build but
loads the .lisp rather than the .o files. The src/interp/Makefile
makes a file called "makeint.lisp" in the obj/linux/interp directory
which is the final script to build interpsys.  I just hack that to
load the .lisp files and call it debugsys.

re: work. 100% of my time has been spent on documentation. I have an
axiom--book--1 branch on tenkan where I'm making progress. I have
requests out to several authors for copies of their research papers
related to Axiom algebra and Nic has agreed to let me use his thesis
work. I'll be creating the axiom--coerce--1 branch once that arrives.
Fabrizio just sent me new algebra and I have to work it into the
system.  I'll put the code into the axiom--algebra--1 branch as soon
as I doc it.  I've also written up, for my own understanding, the
axiom--crystal--1 design docs (I just got biffed about a conference on
Mathematical Knowledge Management which is a dead-center target for
Crystal but they need the paper by April and that can't happen).

Stacked behind that are a bunch of changes to Axiom's latex output
which needs work. I've been sending myself "fix-this" messages that
are queueing up for work.

Also on the queue is building a live-CD version of Axiom. Dirk has a
Quantian CD (which contains quantitative software) based on Debian.  I
think it should be relatively easy (did I mention that there is no
such thing as a simple job?) to add Axiom (and, by side-effect GCL) to
the CD. This will give us a plug-and-play platform. I'd like to get a
lot of the CA systems on one CD so we can use the CD as a basis for
developing algorithms (literate ones :-)).

I'm happy to see that you're making performance changes to lisp.
Everything helps. 

I'll look at the array issue at the next logical break in the
documentation work (probably the next chapter boundary).

============================================

                         MKM 2004

             Third International Conference on
            MATHEMATICAL  KNOWLEDGE  MANAGEMENT

                  http://mizar.org/MKM2004

                  September 19 - 21, 2004
                    Bialowieza - Poland
           (organized by University of Bialystok)

                  Second Call for Papers

Mathematical Knowledge Management is a new field in the intersection
of mathematics and computer science.

We need new techniques for managing the enormous volume of
mathematical knowledge available in current mathematical sources and
making it available through the new developments in information
technology.

Mathematical knowledge is a treasure unsurpassed in its extent,
richness, and interconnectedness, its vitality to engineering,
science, and mathematics itself, its daily use by millions of people.
And thus mathematical knowledge seems to be an excellent candidate for
testing innovative theoretical and technological solutions for
content-based information systems, their interoperability, and
management of machine processable information on the Semantic Web.

The Conference aims to bring together mathematicians, software
developers, publishing companies, math organizations, and
teachers for exchanging their views and approaches, current activities
and new initiatives.

                        CALL FOR PAPERS

The Conference looks for original contributions to theoretical,
technological and pragmatical aspects of Mathematical Knowledge
Management. Papers focused on system/projects descriptions and
comparison, standardization efforts, critical surveys, large
experiments, and case studies are particularly welcome. A list of
topics (to be understood as specialized to the realm of mathematical
information) comprises but is not restricted to:

Authoring languages and tools	  MathML and XML based standards
Computer Algebra Systems          Metadata
Data Mining                       Deduction Systems
Digital Libraries                 Math Assistants
Interactive learning              Searching and Retrieving
Web presentation of mathematics   Languages of mathematics
Knowledge representation          Repositories of formalized mathematics

Submission

The submission of papers will be electronic and should be emailed
directly to the Program Committee using the email address:
     mkm2004submission@mizar.uwb.edu.pl.
The deadline for submissions is April 15, 2004. Submitted papers must
be original and not submitted for publication elsewhere. All papers
submitted to the Conference will be reviewed. Accepted papers will
appear in the proceedings before the Conference (see below).

Proceedings

The proceedings of the Conference we plan to publish in the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/). Submitted papers must be
prepared according to "Authors Instructions of LNCS"
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). We strongly
encourage the author(s) to use LaTeX. Authors of accepted papers
are expected to present their work at the conference.

Location

The MKM 2004 will be held in Conference Centre of the Bialowieza
National Park (listed on the World Heritage List), situated on the
grounds of historic, picturesque Palace Park, in neighbourhood of the
one of a few remaining European lowland natural forests. The wilderness
of nature and beauty of the scenery create an unforgettable atmosphere
of the kingdom of bisons (http://www.mos.gov.pl/kzpn/en/bial_gb.htm).

Subject: LaTeX output

Hello *,

I've installed a recent cvs axiom, and made some experiments with the
LaTeX generation stuff. I replaced some of very old plain TeX constructs
by their modern LaTeX forms, like

{x \over y} -> \frac{x}{y}
{x \sp y} -> {x}^{y}
{\root n \of x} -> \sqrt[n]{x}

Is there any reason to retain the old plain-TeX output? Does anybody
need it, or it can be replaced by the proper LaTeX output?

Use of $$...$$ in LaTeX is discouraged. I propose to replace it by
\[...\] . Comments?

The main reason I'm doing this is, of course, the TeXmacs interface. The
current setup, where axiom outputs old plain-TeX constructs, and tm_axiom
tries to parse it back (!!!) and replace by proper LaTeX constructs, is
unsatisfactory; it is much better to fix the problem, not to build
complicated workarounds. I see 2 possible ways to make this interface
better:

1. Either I duplicate the LaTeX generation code to TeXmacs generation
code, make adjustments, and introduce a new command
)set output texmacs on
(haven't looked at the code which processes system commands, but I'm sure
this must be not too difficult).

2. Or I make LaTeX generation parametrized. The number of required
differences is small: for TeXmacs, it is essential to generate \* for
multiplication, while for ordinary LaTeX, this should be either nothing
or, perhaps, \, ; TeXmacs stuff like \2latex: should be in the prelude and
the matching \5 at the end; maybe, a few other trivial points. I can
introduce a global variable latexMultiplicationString, for example, and
assign "\*" to it for TeXmacs and "\," (or "") for LaTeX. Or I can collect
all such hook strings into a Record, and have latexHooks and texmacsHooks
with all settings.

Which approach seems better to you?

Subject: Re: LaTeX output

Andrej,

The essence of the discussion centers around the fact that techexplorer
uses the latex generation just like texmacs does. I've had a discussion
with the techexplorer people (it is now a non-IBM product) and they are
interested in "reconnecting" to Axiom. The code is still there and, 
as far as I know, still works. We have to be careful not to break it.

So we must be conservative in making wholesale latex changes. There have
been several discussions about "the standard" but I haven't seen any
references. (e.g. You state that \[ should be used rather than $$).

I'm queueing up a bunch of minor latex changes (such as making 
Hexadecimal use \rm and making numeric output respect embedded
spacing). Once I start on that work I'll have a deeper clue about
what changes we can make.

Perhaps we could create a TexMacro domain that holds the style of
output we'd like. This could be referenced when code is generated.

Greetings!  The following versions of lengthenvec and make-init-vector

(defun make-init-vector (n val) (make-array n :initial-element val :fill-pointer t))

(in macros.lisp.pamphlet) cut out the lion's share of the gc problem
on this compile.  30min -> 7 min on my box.  There is still some gc
churning in cons pages due to many calls to 'list' with small n.  One
can likely improve things further with an appropriate (declare
(:dynamic-extent ...)) in the right place -- gcl will allocate such
lists on the C stack (very fast).

The above timings also incorporated another modification/performance
improvement to gcl, so the actual improvement over the present
situation is likely greater.  This is a replacement of the single
(declare (integer count)) in gcl_seqlib.lsp with (declare (fixnum
count)).  After a bit more testing I intend to commit this.  I first
want to figure out why it got there in the first place.

There is an Aldor project, but it is not open source. I can see that 
Axiom is, but the only tarball I could find was from the Debian project, 
and it fails on make with

"gcl-2.6.1.tgz: Cannot open: No such file or directory"

What is the relationship of Aldor to Axiom? Is there a working source 
distribution of Axiom out there? Is this the right place to ask these 
questions?

Subject: Re: Axiom, Aldor, Open Source

Jim,

Axiom is now open source and freely available. You can
download the sources from:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom. 
The easiest way to get them is:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/projects/axiom login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/projects/axiom co axiom

The login command will give you a password prompt. Just hit enter.
The "co axiom" command will check out the latest axiom and download
it to an "axiom" directory in your current directory (yourpath).

To build it type:

cd (yourpath)/axiom
export AXIOM=(yourpath)/axiom/mnt/linux
make


Aldor was the result of a design effort to clean up the old language.
Both the internal Axiom compiler (written in lisp) and the Aldor 
compiler (written in C) were upgraded to accept the same language.

For all practical purposes Axiom can use, but does not need, Aldor.
If you want to write new algebra it is infinitely easier to use
Axiom as you can leverage other people's algorithms.

Aldor can be used within Axiom but also capable of standalone code.
If you want to write a program to do non-algebra work Aldor is a
better language than most.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just a note here -- this is a gcl source tarball, not an executable.
If you need access to gcl independently, please check out

no, the internal (spad) compiler compiles to lisp.
the external (aldor) compiler is designed to target multiple languages.
one of the target languages is the axiom internal lisp language.

Bertfried,

Yes, I've been pushing heavily on the book. I finished working
thru all but the appendix early this morning. I have to revisit
the graphics chapter as I can't figure out how to get two pics
on one page. Other than that the whole thing is there, has been
completely reworked with new material added, and will shortly
be integrated into the system once I figure out how to merge
an arch branch back to the main branch. The appendix is still
broken but I'm debating about auto-generating it anyway.

You should be able to get the latest changes by just typing
   tla update
in the axiom--book-1 project directory. 

You can send me the typos that you've found as I'm sure there
are many that I've missed. I need feedback from many eyes.

This version will go into the standard distribution very soon
but will only exist in its current form for a short while. I
plan to redo the whole thing to integrate it more with the
whole literate programming thing. However, that is going to 
take some design and implementation time on my part before it
shows up in the main branch.

I did see a section on Clifford algebras (9.10 in the electronic
version, 9.9 in the book). Could you look that over and possibly
update/add to it?

As you can see from this console message:

the spadcolors.h file needs X11/X.h. This implies that the user has not
installed XFree86-devel which contains the X developer libraries.

This should be checked in the ./configure script for Axiom.
Does anyone have experience writing these scripts and can you

No. However, this script requires python and it seems to be bugzilla
specific. As far as I know, savannah is not using bugzilla.

I agree with you that such a script would be helpfull. This script could
also be used in case Axiom does not compile.

Please call the script something like axiom-report-bug, because some
systems like debian have already a reportbug command.

Having the same fields as the current bug report form would be useful.
 http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=axiom&func=additem

Why not adding a 'make dist' Makefile target that makes the tarball for
source distribution? This target would prepare a shell script that
includes the Arch branch and revision[1] to know on which source code
the bug is reported. Or just a 'make axiom-report-bug' to produce the
script. 

For operating system, "uname -a" should be sufficient.

However, I don't know how to find current user email and user name (from
$USER env variable?).

I propose following script as a starting point:

---start-of-script----
#!/bin/sh

emailaddr="Tim Daly,list"

version="axiom@tenkan.org--axiom/axiom--release--1--patch-4"

reportfile=`mktemp` || (echo "Cannot create temporary file" && exit 1)
system=`uname -a`

editor=`which emacs`

echo "Axiom bug report for $version" > $reportfile
echo "System: $system" >> $reportfile
echo "User: $USER" >> $reportfile
echo "-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-" >> $reportfile
echo "Title: please enter a miningful bug report title here" >> $reportfile
echo >> $reportfile
echo "Please make a detail report on what is failing: the commands you" >> $reportfile
echo "have typed, the results Axiom has produced, the expected results." >> $reportfile
echo >> $reportfile

$editor $reportfile

mail "$emailaddr" < $reportfile

echo "I have sent your bug report to $emailaddr. You can also find it in file $reportfile."
---end-of-script----


I don't know how to guess correctly the $editor part and the $USER part.

[1] "tla logs -f|tail -1" produces something like:
axiom@tenkan.org--axiom/axiom--release--1--patch-4

Yes, this is not too hard.  GCL's configure.in is a mess, but you can
find an example in there of just about anything you'd like to do.
configure is made from configure.in by 'autoconf'.  config.h if any is
made from configure.in by 'autoheader'.

As Tim said, likely not in the sense you mean.  But if axiom is built
on gcl, you can compile your code, load the .o file, and )lisp
(si::save-system "foo") to get a standalone foo executable containing
all of gcl/axiom and your new code together.

Any ideas on what I have done wrong? In fact, I have relaunched the
compilation and the failing file seems to have been compiled now. I
really don't understand. A latent memory bug in GCL?

My system, Debian GNU/Linux sarge (aka testing), linux kernel 2.6, 1 GB
of RAM.

Here is a patch that adds the Axiom Book as a target in the
Makefile. The ps/ directory is copied into the target directory,
otherwise the dvi book lacks graphics.

By the way, Tim, I think it would be useful to produce a PDF file which
is the defacto standard for documentation. We have several options: 

 - use pdflatex (it would consist in making a pdfdocument command). The
   main issue is that pdflatex can only import graphics in the pdf
   format. It can be tricky to write a latex file that can be compiled
   for both dvi and pdf formats. I've done that once but I don't

I find this command gives me fuzzy output and have not been able to
find a good way to produce readable PDF files. Also, the PDF files are huge.

This gets back to the subject of handling the axiom documentation.
Clearly we're going to have hundreds of doc files. We're going to
need a way to organize them, navigate among them, etc. PDF format
seems to make that process harder. However, PDFs are widely readable.
The way foreword (:-)) seems uncertain.

I think the problem is not with the quality of the PDF that
is produced but rather with the PDF reader/view software.
Newer versions of Ghostscript (since at least 7.x, I think)
and Acrobat Reader (newest version 6), have very good display
of type 1 fonts.

> Also, the PDF files are huge.

Usually, compared to postscript PDF files are quite small.
But of course compared to original LaTeX and dvi files,
PDF is usually larger. But if you are seeing differences
that qualify as huge, then perhaps there may be problems
with the choice of the format of included graphic files.

I use dvipdf to do the dvi -> pdf conversion and the result is fuzzy.
I think that the problem might be in the conversion program.
I'll download the latest reader and see if this improves things.

Whatever we do should be autogenerated from the original files.
PDFs are fine and quite useful and we may want to include them
(at least as a ./configure option) but the real issue will be
finding ways to move among all the documentation that gets generated.
PDFs can have hyperlinks but I don't think they support linking "into"
a PDF document.

Hi all.  Firstoff, wanted to thank Tim for the amazing work on the
Axiom book.  Having the bare beginnings of a manual in Maxima, I'm
green with envy at the complete state of the book.  Is Oreilly or
someone going to publish a copy at some point in the future?  1000+
pages is a little stiff for the printer at work, let alone mine.

Second question - how would one go about packaging axiom up for a Linux
distribution, particularly a source comple based one?  Gentoo, for
example, has some definite ideas about sandbox type behavior and I was
wondering if anyone has tried making an axiom package for a source
based distro?  FreeBSD has a similar system, so that might also be
relevant.  I'm not able to try anything yet here since (time crunch
aside) I'm having problems compiling gcl.

CY,

I have no plans to publish a paper copy but it's open source so
anyone can publish it. I do have plans to break it up and restructure
it so that it fits into the long term plans but that won't happen for
quite a while. The short term plan is to finish the current review
(to fix up the remaining issues) and then move on to getting the
graphics back to life, followed by hypertex, aldor, openmath, and the
numeric library support. At which point "axiom" will exist with the
capabilities it used to have but will have been rebuilt to fit the 
new, long term directions.

As for printing, I find that dvips has a couple useful options.
I can print it two-sided (on a single-sided laser printer (about
3 inches thick)) and print smaller sections of it by:

  dvips -A -pp 100-200 -r book.dvi    <== print even pages 100-200
  (reload the pages into the feeder)
  dvips -B -pp 100-200 book.dvi    <== print odd pages 100-200

notes: -A and -B specify even-only or odd-only pages
       -pp specifies a page range
       -r  stacks the pages in reverse order (so you don't have to
           restack the pages before putting them back into the printer)


You can get a source-only distribution by just doing:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/projects/axiom login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/projects/axiom co axiom
tar -zcf axiom.tgz axiom

which will download the lastest version and tar up the directory.
I'm not sure what other packaging constraints Gentoo has as I've
never used that distro.

I tried to build axiom on a BSD system but failed. BSD uses old-style
make and the commands are not gnu-compatible. It's a goal to get
axiom running everywhere, including BSD, but my week-long attempt failed.
I also tried to get it to run on Apple's OS-X which is BSDish and failed
again. My years-old Unix skills have been badly mangled by Gnu-ish versions.
I'll make a sustained effort at some point but not in the near future.

If you're having trouble with building axiom I recommend that you
build it in an emacs shell, save the console output, and send it
to me. That way I can see what happened.

Sorry about that :-). I've been working on the book since Sept. 
and I've finally decided to devote all of my effort to getting it done.
I've finished the first, major pass and now I'm reviewing it for typos,
changes, line overruns, etc.

The big changes left to do are to include the graphics (I can't figure
out how to get two pictures on one page in latex), to fix up the
appendix, and to add a few items like the end-flap charts (assuming I
can figure out a way to draw pictures), possibly some BNF for the
language (assuming I can work it out), and removing the "what's new"
chapter. I'd like to add a chapter explaining the pamphlet format
as well as some build-from-scratch instructions. I'd also like a 
chapter that develops a domain in detail so people can learn how
to program in spad. I wrote a similar chapter for the aldor compiler
years ago.

There has been a drumbeat for a PDF version and Bill has suggested that
I try pdflatex rather than dvipdf. It's on the to-do list.

The only pervasive change I'm contemplating is a global margins change
to use more of the "paper" width. Of course, this change will destroy
some of my carefully hand-crafted examples but such is life, eh?
The original book was very cleverly crafted to use wide paper and
marginal notes but my version is almost nowhere the same (internally)
as I've rewritten everything. I simplified the internals as much as
I could so that it would fit better with the long-term plans.

A later change, not contemplated for the near term, is to use David's
booklet program to change from a book.pamphlet format to a book.booklet
format. This will allow me to split the book into chapters, integrate
it with the literate program output, etc.

Anyway, I expect the changes to slow down in the next two weeks as I
finally accomplish goals. This whole effort took much longer than I
expected.

CY,

One of the things under discussion (though not of late) is to 
combine Axiom and Maxima. Clearly they can both live in the same
lisp image and, from Axiom, it is possible to start maxima by doing:

)lisp (maxima)

When you exit maxima you are back in Axiom. 

There are algorithms in Maxima which exist nowhere else. It would
be useful to be able to use these algorithms in Axiom. I believe
this is possible by writing Axiom "cover functions", perhaps in
a "Maxima domain". I'm not quite sure how to use Axiom functions
in Maxima (although Axiom is really just common lisp it assumes a
lot of machinery). And there are issues about "carrying the type"
that need some deep thought. 

There are advantages to working on a joint effort, the primary one
being that we share rare and much needed expertise. There are few
people who are computational mathematicians and, since we are all
working on the same subject matter, it is painful to see such a
division of labor without the usual benefit.

If you think this might be of interest to you please let me know.

Another pending change in the longer term is to redo the literate
programming tool. The current plan is to change it to use latex
syntax so that:


<<some chunk name>>=   becomes \begin{chunk}{some chunk name}
@                      becomes \end{chunk}
[[escaped text]]       becomes \escape{escaped text}
<<some chunk name>>    becomes \chunk{some chunk name}

This allows latex to at least parse the pamphlet files and 
makes the "transition" to literate programming seems less painful.
Since Axiom doesn't make use of any other features of noweb this 
is a syntactic change. The pre-process step still occurs and will
expand to handle chunk protocols beyond the current syntax of:

  <<pamphlet://URI>>

Hello Tim,

As a proof of concept, I have produced a PDF version of the Axiom Book
using the hyperref package and pdflatex.

You'll find it at: http://www.linux-france.org/~dmentre/tmp/book.pdf

I had issues with graphics. I have transformed all of them with ps2pdf
and epstopdf but the transformation of bessintr.ps failed (lack of
Bounding Box). Moreover, once included, they have strange behavior (the
graphic is alone on a page). I've not investigated much on this issue.

You'll notice that the PDF version of the book as internal hyperlinks
(see the table of content). The produced file is about 3 MB. It should
be viewable on any platform.

To produce the pdf, I modified book.pamphlet with:

 %\usepackage{axiom}
 \usepackage{graphicx}
+\usepackage{hyperref}
 % struggle with latex figure-floating behavior

And all the lines included the graphics with:
 \begin{figure}[htbp]
-\includegraphics[bbllx=14, bblly=14, bburx=176, bbury=186]{ps/P28a.eps}
+\includegraphics[bbllx=14, bblly=14, bburx=176, bbury=186]{pdf/P28a.pdf}

It appears that $AXIOM is not being set properly every time.
axiom is actually a shell script that lives in $AXIOM/bin.
You can modify it to echo $AXIOM and see if it differs on each run.

This is normal when you use this approach.  We use the graphicx package
to import images into LaTeX which is designed to deal with latex vs
pdflatex issues.  Given a postscript file we convert it to a png using
the convert utility from the ImageMafick package (on Linux).  If you
then have a line like: \includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{pic} in your source
file it will use the ps file when processing with latex and the png file
when processing with pdflatex.  The results usually look identical.
