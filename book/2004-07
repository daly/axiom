Thank you!

Yes, that's what I thought...

Hmm, not really. The reason for this is, I believe that agreement is very
important with respect to applying patches, closing bug reports and so on. And
I know that I'm very often uncertain whether agreement has been reached or not.
After all, that's why I wrote the summary to the bug report above.

In fact this very issue "0^0" is a wonderful example: Although I'm confident
that it is, it is not obvious, at least, not to me, whether our reasoning is
correct. Maybe time will tell -- in case it is not :-)

So the current setup works well for me: there are very few people with admin
access and I trust them not to take action before agreement has been reached.

On the other hand, I am happy to summarize discussions where I'm able to.

Martin

Hello Camm,

I have downloaded cvs 040701 and configured --enable-debug.
The build fails, as before.

The commands
cd lsp/gcl-2.6.2/unixport
gdb saved_gcl, r, (load "../gcl-tk/tkl.o)

did not reproduce the crash.

What would you like to run in gdb? Is the gdb command missing?

Best regards,

Greetings, and thanks for this.  Gave it a quick once over, and don't
expect this to give us trouble, but of course could be wrong.  The
emphasis in these patches appears to be executable permissions in
various memory areas, but this has never posed a problem to GCL, as we
explicitly mprotect PROT_EXEC anything we need (or should be anyway).
The problem for us is rather in the seldom mentioned companion
'feature' in that the semantics of brk have been changed to return a
randomized address.  We're even ok with this up to the point of
emacs' unexec, which is used in saving a new image.  We now compile
out of the box on machines using this by detecting it at configure
time, and compiling into main the 'i386 personality' setting calls
followed by a reexec.

The danger for us might be that someday people might want to close
this runtime exception possibility which only 'broken legacy apps'
might need anyway and leave us stranded.  Luckily, GNU emacs is our
exact bulwark in this area -- we should be able to follow whatever
procedure allows a gnu emacs build inside of gcl proper.

I'm not sure how important this may be, but I think that a certain
level of sustained noise from gcl/maxima/acl2/axiom users propagating
upstream about our reliance on this might forestall a future
'enhancement' which breaks our build entirely.  Was even dreaming
about firing off an email from within gcl at each i386 personality
set.  Don't worry, just dreaming :-).

If you ever have access to a machine with these new patches and want
help in checking it out, please let me know.

Take care,

Martin,

>access and I trust them not to take action before agreement has been reached.

I'm very conservative about changes where the algebra is concerned.
Even for "obvious to the average nosepicker" changes there are 
hard and interesting mathematical questions. In general the updates
I've done have been done by the original authors of the packages
(Sit, Lambe, Rioboo, etc). I don't know enough mathematics to be
considered an authority.

>On the other hand, I am happy to summarize discussions where I'm able to.

I listen carefully to the discussion but unless somebody sends me a
diff -Naur old new
patch file and a test case or two it is unlikely that I'd make a change. 

However, if you author a new math package I'm happy to add it. 
rinterp.spad.pamphlet exists in the current distribution and you
are the authority for it. It isn't "exposed" so people can't see
it unless they explicitly expose it but it is there.

Tim

SEX, SEXOF, and SEXCAT are Axiom cover functions for lisp S-expressions.

Thus if you want to construct something you have to build it up from
the primitives using things like:

-> m:=[1::SEX, 2::SEX]
     [1,2]
                 Type: List SExpression

having this primitive you can "upgrade" it to a list structure with:

-> n:=m::SEX
     (1 2)
                 Type: SExpression

and then you can operate on it:

-> car(n)
     1
                 Type: SExpression

do a ")show SEX" and you can see the ways you can manipulate the SExpression.

SEX is pretty low level stuff. It is essentially lisp list manipulation
at the Axiom level.

Are you sure that this is a bug? After all, n is not an Axiom List...

Tim: 

I cannot coerce a domain into a SExpression, which is needed to call the
function any from ANY to coerce an object to Any.

SEX::SEX

  Cannot convert the type Domain to SExpression for value SExpression()

Greetings, and thanks!

This is due to an old gcl somehow havving gotten its way into axiom.

Just did a cvs axiom checkout on Andrey's machine, and see the
following in the top of lsp/gcl-2.6.2/debian/changelog:

gcl (2.6.1-26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rework compiler::*ld-libs*, compiler::link, and unixport/makefile to
    accomodate mingw need for firstfile.o and lastfile.o
  * Remove incompatible -fomit-frame-pointer when compiling with -pg
    profiling
  * Load sys-proclaim.lisp files forimproved linking and smaller object
    size across the board, install same for use with compiler::link
  * Use pathnames instead of strings in compiler::link, also in image
    init files, for Windows
  * small mod to unixport/makefile re filtering of firstfile and
    lastfile
  * Backport zero divisor error cnditions from HEAD for

  * Default to debug mode on hppa to work around gcc compiler
    optimization bugs

gcl (2.6.1-25) unstable; urgency=low

This is several versions (about 5 months) behind the 2.6.2 release,
which should look like:

gcl (2.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * gcc-3.4 support
  * Proper isnormal default courtesy of Magnus Henoch
  * gclclean makefile target and other small makefile changes
  * Proper check for C stack array body address in gbc.c and sgbc.c
  * New upstream release
  * acconfig.h update for isnormal default
  * Fix bug in setting elements (si::aset) of 0 rank arrays uncovered by
    the random tester
  * No -fomit-frame-pointer on mingw
  * Backport minimal ansi-test patches from HEAD to enable running of
    the random tester
  * installed tcl/tk patch for mingw
  * Fix banner license detection code in lsp/gcl_mislib.lsp as
    8features* entries are now keywords
  * o/makefile changes to work around trailing slash -I arguments gcc
    bug on mingw
  * Patch to mingwin.c:fix_filename to close long standing 'maxima
    ignore-errors filename corruption' bug on mingw
  * Check for too large rank supplied to make-array1
  * Fix potential stack overwrite bug in quick_call_sfun/eval.c
  * Add -mprferred-stack-boundary=8 on amd64, as constant integers used
    in a call must be retrievable with va_arg(,fixnum)
  * Revert preferred-stack-boundary option on amd64 as it does not play
    well with external libraries, also eliminate -m64 to allow for user
    settings.  Cast fixnum constant C arguments in gcl_cmploc.lsp
    explicitly to (long) to ensure they can be extracted via
    va_arg(,fixnum)
  * reenable SA_SIGINFO on amd64 to restore SGC there
  * Include elf.h in FreeBSD.h
  * Allow for elf_abi.h in FreeBSD.h
  * Add README.openbsd file
  * readme.mingw updates
  * solaris.h updates for custreloc option
  * Close possibility of malloc failure due to intervening gbc arising
    from the misordering of allocation calls
  * C_GC_OFFSET is 2 on m68k-linux
  * Add release notes, remove gcl document presumably based on dpANS for
    now
  * Fixup bad extern declaration of signals_handled in usig.c

I've verified the crash with the axiom patched old gcl version, and
verified that stock gcl-2.6.2 does not show the crash on the same
machine.  I can obviously look further to see if the older version is
to blame or the axiom patches, but its probably most efficient at this
point to get the right source tree in place.  In any case, the
transparent Fedora support was added after this point, so we really
want this in for axiom.

Could not complete the axiom build on Andrey's machine with stock
2.6.2 due to a system misconfiguration:

Camm,

I used the CVS checkout line you sent me. 
I clipped it directly from the mail.
How this could have happened is unclear and very troubling
as I updated my tree immediately after our email exchange,
did a complete checkout/rebuild, and then checked in the change.
It is unclear where an old version could have come from.

Please do a CVS checkout of the current Axiom source tree and
see if this is broken. If so, please let me know the exact CVS
checkout string I should use to get the latest GCL and some
way to verify that it is the latest.

Once I've verified that I have the latest I'll do another
checkout/rebuild. 

color me puzzled,
Tim

Camm,

I've GOT it.....

The latest version in the CVS is gcl-2.6.2a, not gcl-2.6.2.
There was a bit of "flutter" because I was tracking your changes
too closely, thus the latest GCL is gcl-2.6.2a.tgz.

Axiom is actually built using gcl-2.6.2a (see the top of the Makefile
in the axiom toplevel directory).

gcl-2.6.2a should be the very latest GCL.

Tim

Greetings!

I confirm that zips/gcl-2.6.2a.tgz is the right tarball, but
zips/gcl-2.6.2.tgz is apparently what is being unpacked and built by
default, at least as of a fresh cvs checkout a few minutes ago.

I'd suggest renaming gcl-2.6.2a.tgz -> gcl-2.6.2.tgz.

Take care,

Hi

You haven't sent me your account stuff like I asked in private mail :-)

A quick question or two which may be followed by harder ones (it is!):

Why does axiom build its own LISP(s) instead of using LISP(s) that I may 
already have on my system?  Is this the different characteristics of 
different LISPs mentioned in the top-level README file?  

Is there any preference of using LISP versions that are 1) the same or 2) 
different from what I have on my machine?  For example, if I have gcl 2.5.2 
installed on my machine, should I necessarily choose GCLVERSION=gcl-2.5.2 in 
my makefile (or from an export GCLVERSION)?

Finally,  I believe the top level Makefile.dvi description states that gcl 
2.4.1 is the default gcl version.  The CVS toplevel Makefile seems to have 
the GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.2 line uncommented.  Is this as intended or do the 
docs need updated?

A second issue:  I tried compiling just now and I got numerous errors, though 
it continued through them.  There seems to be a number of successful compiles 
and a number of unsuccessful compiles.  Here is an example:

Do either of these point to something I should (or shouldn't) be doing in my 
compile process.   If you need a more detailed log, I can do make > make.log 
or some such and mail it to you or put it up on a temporary web page.

Camm,

I found the problem. I failed to regenerate the top level Makefile.
Mea Culpa. I'll fix it now.

In trying to get axiom to compile, I made the top level Makefile read:

****************************************
#GCLVERSION=gcl-2.4.1
#GCLVERSION=gcl-2.5
GCLVERSION=gcl-2.5.2
#GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.1
#GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.2
*****************************************

This resulted in the following error:

make[2]: Entering directory `/home/mfenner/tmp/axiom/lsp'
2 building gcl-2.5.2
tar: /home/mfenner/tmp/axiom/zips/gcl-2.5.2.tgz: Cannot open: No such file or 
directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
make[2]: *** [gcldir] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/mfenner/tmp/axiom/lsp'
make[1]: *** [lspdir] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/mfenner/tmp/axiom'
make: *** [all] Error 2


There seems to be no gcl-2.5.2.tgz file in the zips/ directory.  There are 
however a number of 2.5.2 related patch files.  Should I ignore this and 
focus on getting the 2.6.2 version to work?  I'm still a bit confused as to 
why there need to be different GCLVERSION(s) if axiom builds it regardless or 
what is on the user's system.

Regards,
Mark

Camm,

I'm not sure how I mangled that. All of my local copies say 2.6.2a.
Anyway, I'm updating the CVS with the correct value.

Please pull the latest Makefile.pamphlet and Makefile.

Tim

Mark,

Every version of GCL builds and runs on my system.
Camm has made updates in the last few months that may affect your system.
I've been using gcl-2.6.2a which is the latest version of GCL.
(The trailing 'a' is due to the fact that I was tracking Camm's changes
too closely and ended up being unable to build GCL so I needed to keep
two "current" versions).

You can either pull down the latest Makefile.pamphlet and Makefile or
modify your current top level Makefile to put a trailing 'a' on the version.
It should read:

GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.2a

I'm sorry for the confusion. Somehow I didn't put the correct copy of
the top level Makefile into the CVS. I never noticed because the 
"round-trip" (checkin-checkout) tests I do would succeed with either
version and all of my other "working" copies have the gcl-2.6.2a version.

Tim

Greetings!  And thank you so much for your quick reply!  Not to be a
pest, but now the patches are not applying:

19 making /fix/g/camm/axiom/cvs/axiom/lsp
make[2]: Entering directory `/fix/g/camm/axiom/cvs/axiom/lsp'
2 building gcl-2.6.2a
/bin/sh: line 1: cd: gcl-2.6.2a/h: No such file or directory
3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs
can't find file to patch at input line 3
Perhaps you should have used the -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:

File to patch: 

I think 2.6.2a unpacked into lsp/gcl.

Take care,

re: gcl vs gcl-2.6.2a
yep. fixed that.
then it fails because there is now a newline at the end of unixport/makefile. 
one of the patches could not be applied because the patch added the newline.
fixed that too.

The CVS upload is complete.
I'm in the process of round-trip testing the build.
I spoke to Mark on the phone and he's going to try the build again tomorrow.

Camm,

The build fails now. 
I'm chasing the failure.

I found two ways to do this:

d:=devaluate(INT)$Lisp
  (Integer)              Type: SExpression
a:=any(d, 3::None)
  3                      Type: Integer
obj a

  Function Selection for obj
    Arguments: ANY
  [1] signature: ANY -> NONE
      implemented: slot (None)$ from ANY

  NONE                   Type: OutputForm

The second way is simpler:

a:=coerce(3)$ANY1(INT)

What threw me off the track was the very suggestive way to construct an ANY
object using the function any: (SExpression, None)->ANY.

None of the functions exported by SEX, SEXCAT, SEXOF provide any way to input a
SExpression from the interpreter. Typing "(Integer)" (with or without quotes) in
place of the identifier d above will not work.

Is there any documentation for all the Lisp code that can be used in Axiom?
(Lisp is NOT a domain despite the $Lisp notation). Are the commands part of the
Boot language? (this may be a very stupid question).

William

Hello Tim, Camm,

Axiom builds correctly for me. Starting AXIOMsys results in:

Running the original ./axiom supplied after make install results in:

around that calling AXIOMsys directly.

Tim, I waited for your "gcl vs gcl-2.6.2a" update and executed another

Camm,

I found the build problem.
The luser (me) set the AXIOM variable incorrectly.
The round-trip build succeeded.

You can use any Lisp function in the current Lisp package from the Axiom
interpreter using `$Lisp', but you need to bear in mind some slight
syntactic differences.  For instance your example can be done as:
a:=any(['Integer]$Lisp,3::None) -- use [ ... ] as shorthand for list(...)
a:=any(LIST('Integer)$Lisp,3::None) -- apply LIST from Lisp
Note that although the lisp interpreter will upper-case everything,
Axiom doesn't so e.g. list(1)$Lisp won't work.

I thought that you could package-qualify lisp calls in the interpreter
by doing e.g. BOOT_:_:GENVAR()$Lisp, but this doesn't work in my version.

I hope this helps.

Mike.

Thanks, Mike. The BOOT_:_:GENVAR()$Lisp does not work on my version either. But
I noticed the underlines get deleted. Does the underline need any escape
character preceding it? What does this command do?

Try:

GENSYM()$Lisp

That should work.

Hi,

I've just downloaded axiom from (07/02/04) to test RationalInterpolation and
viewAlone.
The rinterp.spad file wasn't generated and here is a patch that changes the
Makefile.

The other problem is that rinterp.spad was badly generated. I think that
martin has to add

 <<package RINTERP RationalInterpolation>>=
 <<package RINTERP RationalInterpolation>>

because the compilation process complains:

 The root module <<package RINTERP RationalInterpolation>> was not defined


I doesn't know this language and  can't help you but I have finally removed
all
the documentation and added the root module.

I have added RINTERP to src/algebra/exposed.lsp.pamphlet (Hidden section)
but I don't know if I had to add it. Does it needed?


Cheers, Greg

PS: the patch was created from src/algebra directory.

The "_" is the escape character in the interpreter.  In Lisp you can
call a function by prefixing it with the name of the package in which it
is defined, so in this case (boot::genvar) should call the genvar
function defined in the boot package (actually (boot:genvar) probably
works because genvar is almost certainly defined as an external symbol).

Unfortunately ":" and "::" have special meanings in the interpreter so
cannot be used to prefix a lisp function with its package name.  I
suspect that BOOT_:_:GENVAR()$Lisp is interpreted as a call to the
symbol |BOOT::GENVAR|, hence the error message.

If you are desperate you can go:
  APPLY(FIND_-SYMBOL('GENVAR,'BOOT)$Lisp,[]$Lisp)$Lisp
which looks up the genvar symbol in the boot package and then applies
it.  Of course in this particular case you can call genvar directly since
boot is in fact the current package.

Cheers, Mike.

Well GENVAR()$Lisp actually works.  The point was that package-calling
doesn't work as expected.

I'm forwarding this to math because I think some of the issues belong there.

Dear Tim,

Hm, in fact, I thought that it was a little to earlz to release rinterp.spad to
the world, since I expect it to change. I also noticed that you included the
version which does *not* parallel pinterp.spad... in fact, I think that there
should be one package pinterp.spad which includes all sorts of interpolation
algorithms, and a common interface should be worked out, i.e., what kind of
arguments does it take, what's the type of the result and so on. I don't want
to have a bad setup which is difficult to change once its included in the
"official" release because somebody might be using it already.

Here are the questions involved:

1* RINTERP has the following interface:

PolynomialInterpolation(xx, F): Cat == Body   where
    xx: Symbol
    F:  Field
    UP  ==> UnivariatePolynomial
    SUP ==> SparseUnivariatePolynomial
 
    Cat ==> with
        interpolate: (UP(xx,F), List F, List F) -> UP(xx,F)
                ++ interpolate(u,lf,lg) \undocumented
        interpolate: (List F, List F)           -> SUP F
                ++ interpolate(lf,lg) \undocumented

What I do not understand is: although the constructor takes an argument xx,
this argument is *not* used by the exported functions. For example, you have to
say interpolate(x,[1,2,3],[1,4,9])$PINTERP(x,FRAC INT) to get a UP in x. In
fact, this function does nothing more than the second version, followed by an
elt. To be honest, I would remove it.

2* Furthermore, when the xdata contain duplicates, interpolate exits with
  catdef: division by zero, which is correct. However, since it seems
  impossible to catch an error programmatically, it might be sensible to return
  "failed" instead.

3* RationalInterpolation is a tiny bit more subtle, since it may happen that
  some points are "unattainable", i.e., not interpolated correctly, and it may
  even happen that the interpolating function is undefined at certain points
  (because the denominator vanishes).  It might be the case that it is more
  effective to test this during the interpolation and to return a list of these
  points, but I'm not sure about it (as above)

4* rationalinterpolation currently returns a FRAC POLY F, which is not good. I
  did this, because I was unable how to convert a SUP into a POLY at the time,
  and I needed a POLY. This should definitely be changed.

5* What's the proper modeline of Hermite-interpolation (giving derivatives on
  some points) ?

When we have discussed (or I have reached a conclusion regarding) at least
points 3 and 4 its OK for me to include rinterp (or an extension of pinterp,
what I would prefer) into the official release.

Martin

PS: Tim, why did you convert pmatrix into array in the pamphlet file?

Bill,

re:   http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki/June32004

I've rebuilt the page using the new \begin{axiom}, \end{axiom}, fixed
a typo or two, added a couple equations.  I love the new Axiom I/O
feature. There are several places that have tried to put computer
algebra systems on the web. This is a huge step forward. Nice work.

Tim

Martin,

Oops, you did ask me to wait before release. Sorry about that.
The RINTERP domain is not exposed so unless someone takes explicit
steps to expose it nothing will be available anyway.

I'll look at the rest of your message later. I'm off to a wake.

Camm,

Try running CVS update.

I've had problems with CVS from savannah recently.
Not all of the files get downloaded. 
It has happened several times but I thought it might just be me.
I'm certain the src/graph subdir is there as David has built it.

Let me know what happens.

Tim

Elema, 

Check out the page:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki/June32004

This is a wiki user-editable page.
Each Axiom equation can be run by adding these lines into the page:

\begin{axiom}
... (an axiom input line)
\end{axiom}

I'm not sure if this technique would be useful for ORCCA but you
might find it interesting. The axiom environment causes the
equation to be executed in a background axiom and the result
is rendered on the web page. All equations on the same page
are run in one copy of Axiom making it possible to develop
documentation online. Since ORCCA wants to work with several
systems perhaps it could copy the technique and implement

\begin{maple}
\begin{yacas} ... etc


Bill Page, one of the axiom developers, is responsible for this.

Tim

Tim,

Here are some more example pages

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/Members/billpage

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/Members/billpage/AxiomCommands

I have made a few more improvements to the AXIOM web interface.
I think it will now handle all the usual forms of AXIOM input
including multi-line function definitions with standard
indentation for blocks, system commands like )show Integer,
and graceful output in case of syntax errors, etc.

I have also changed the display so that AXIOM commands appear
highlighted and equation numbers appear on the right hand side.
As is the convention in LatexWiki,

  http://mcelrath.org/Notes/StructuredTextRules

the equation numbers are assigned hyperlink names of the form
'eq99' (where 99 is the equation number) that can be referenced
from within the page simply as (99) or from elsewhere by a url
ending in #eq99. For example

 
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/Members/billpage/AxiomCommands#eq
4

I would very much like to get some feedback from other Axiom
developers about how this works. If you haven't done so already,
please take a minute to register for access to the Axiom portal

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/join_form

Logging on to this site will allow you to edit the pages and
re-run Axiom online. You can also create your own wiki web pages
that include Axiom output and LaTeX mathematics. You can also
subscribe to the Axiom Wiki so that the contents of new pages
and comments on the pages will be sent to you by email.

Yes as you suggest Tim, the same technique could easily be
used with other CAS programs - especially those that can
produce LaTeX output. The interface to Axiom consists of
a Python module of about 100 lines of code that prepares an
input file for Axiom and parses the output. It depends on
Bob McElrath's LatexWiki extension of Zwiki which runs
under Zope and Plone.

  http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki

The next major step would be to include the Axiom graphics
output on the web page. Once you have the basic Axiom graphics
functionality up and running and producing postscript format
output, I think adding the web interface should be a fairly
easy job.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Very cool!

I released LatexWiki 0.32 this weekend, and in it are some imporovements
for Plone.  Specifically, the stylesheet works in plone so that in-line
equations have a similar font as the page text.

I do not have a convenient way to adjust fonts in plone but would like
to add this.  Normally there is a page

    http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/UserOptions=20

which is not plone-specific, but it looks like it is not installed on
your site.

Bill would you be willing to share these patches so I can distribute
them with LatexWiki?  Did you define a new page type?

Yes, I saw your notice and I look forward to implementing 0.32
but since I have only just got AXIOM working with LatexWiki,
I am a little reluctant to make changes to the axiom-developer.org
system until people have had a chance to use it and comment on
it. I tried a while back to change the stylesheet used by Zwiki
in Plone, but it didn't work on first try and I didn't have time
to go back to it.

When I get around to it, I would also like to implement the
Microsoft IE AlphaImageLoader filter stylesheet behaviour that
corrects the problem with image backgrounds (not transparent) on
IE.

  http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/pngbehavior/pngbehavior.html

Anyway, if someone has additional system resources to spare,
I would be willing to duplicate what I have done so far on
another system with newer versions of Zope, Zwiki, and Plone.
Right now all of these are about 3 months behind current -
not too bad, but things do change quite quickly in this business.

You can access this page on the Zope-based Zwiki/LatexWiki
site:

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/UserOptions

I set up both a "stand alone" LatexWiki at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction

and the Plone-based portal

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone

with the publicly accessible LatexWiki at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki

These are separate wiki's, one with the vanilla Zwiki Zope
skin and the other with the Plone skin in the portal
environment. I think it would be neat if these could both
contain the same contents with just two different look-and-
feel.

There are also other LatexWiki's created by registered users
on the portal.

Apparently UserOptions is only available in the Zope-based
wiki.

>

Yes, absolutely. I would consider them licensed under the
same terms as LatexWiki. I would be very happy if you could
just incorporate them into your LatexWiki distribution. I
consider what I have right now as more or less at the "0.20"
version level. It's just one Python module that implements
the filter and a one line change to ReplaceInlineLatex.py to
call it before calling renderLatex. I can send you the file
whenever you want. Do you have AXIOM installed on one of
your servers?

> Did you define a new page type?

No, but that might be neat. I don't know enough about Zwiki
yet to do that and I haven't looked closely enough at your
install script. Actually, I think the number of different
page types is rather confusing to most users and if I added
a new type, I would probably want to take other less useful
options away.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Would it be possible to place something informative in the ALT
attribute of each image, for example the LaTeX code of the equation,
rather than "LatexWiki image"? People reading these pages with a
braille or speech interface or with a text-only browser would then at
least be able to read the LaTeX.

Of course, the real solution is to offer XHTML+MathML as an output
format, which I am sure is on the development agenda at some point.

This will require a minor rewrite of how I substitute equations back in
the page.  The code is there but disabled.  In-line equations have an
appropriate alt tag.

Please see:

    http://mcelrath.org/Notes/ITeXTest

Which is a working test-page of exactly that.  Right now browser support
is very poor, and is the limiting factor.  This page uses itex:

    http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000374.html

which is a small lex/yacc program to convert a subset of latex to
MathML.  As such it cannot support style files, a latex template, or
some very complex equations.  I then run it through the
LaTeX/ghostscript part to generate images from anything that itex
missed.  More links on this subject can be found on my main LatexWiki
page:

    http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki

I am still contemplating an overhaul that would use tex4ht instead, and
thus allow the use of latex style files.  But this is much more
complicated, and slower.

MathML adoption has been glacially slow due to the chicken and egg
problem between browsers and page creators.  I encourage the AXIOM
project to make use of MathML and help push this!  As far as I know,
Distler's blog (above) is the only site to use exclusively MathML on a
"real" site.  (as opposed to sites talking about MathML implementation
itself, or sites which have MathML toys but no mathematical content of
interest to mathematicians, physicists, or engineers)

Axiom includes support for OpenMath (http://www.openmath.org/) but it
isn't clear from the mailing list discussion whether anyone has
managed to get it to work with any of the open-source axiom releases.

At http://www.openmath.org/ there is an XSLT style sheets intended to
transform OpenMath into presentation MathML. This could perhaps be
used to process output from Axiom in the absence of support for
generating presentation MathML directly.

I am not sure if it is a bug, but I think it would be better if the "feature"
below is modified.

As one knows, it takes quite a few compiles to get a spad file in the right
form, especially when one is learning. I also like to keep a record of the
mistakes I made as well as to document any possible bugs. So what I want to do
is this:

)spool mytest.output
)sys cat mytest.spad
)comp mytest.spad
-- go make some changes
-- repeat the previous two commands
)spool

At the console the file is displayed. However, spool does not capture any output
from the )sys cat command.

I lost all the changes I made to mytest.spad even though eventually, I got it
working.

My request therefore: Is it difficult to modify spool so it will also capture
all the output from a system command like cat? (I don't expect spool to capture
other than "terminal" type output streams.)

William,

)spool is working with terminal i/o from lisp.

)sys starts a new shell with its own i/o rather than using the lisp i/o.

So it's not really a bug but a request for a feature change.

In theory it should be possible to capture the i/o stream from the
shell and redirect it thru a lisp i/o stream but that would require a
different system call from the underlying lisp. I'll look at the code
and see what it currently does. If there is a way that lisp will let
me capture the output I'll rewrite )sys.

interest to post some GCL results here too (using the boyer benchmark

All lisps here are the latest versions in Debian unstable.  GCL was
run in ANSI mode.  The machine was a dual Xeon 2.4Ghz.  We already
know that the relative GCL/CMUCL performance can vary somewhat by
machine, presumably influenced by cache size and cpu/memory bandwidth
ratios.  It is clear for example that CMUCL is doing a better job on
the memory layout/access times which predominate in the gc time
component.  On this particular machine, again presumably, memory
access is not the rate limiting step, and the results are more
governed by in cache cpu performance.

All that one might reasonably conclude from this exercise is that in
some cases, GCL is about as fast as CMUCL.

A few extra notes.  GCL comes with an automatic function proclamation
feature which is useful in optimizing the compile, for both GCL and
CMUCL (at least).  One uses it as follows:

(compiler::emit-fn t)
(compile-file "foo.lisp")
(compiler::make-all-proclaims "foo.fn")
(load "sys-proclaim.lisp")
(compile-file "foo.lisp")

This is not simply bundled into compile-file as it is capable of
generating cross-referencing information across many files that can be
useful in optimizing a real system.  The above tests had the
sys-proclaim.lisp file loaded into each lisp before running
compile-file.  What is interesting is that on my machine at least,
this measurably helped the cmucl compile over a 'vanilla'
compile-file, and the insertion of=20

(declaim (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (compilation-speed
0)))

at the top of the lisp source file actually degraded cmucl performance
from the vanilla version.  The fastest cmucl numbers are reported
above.=20

Take care,

Bob,

I have made some changes to the AxiomWiki code in response to your
suggestions to worry a little about security (I disabled Axiom's )sys
command) and I also added the ability to compile Axiom Library code. =
With
these changes I think I am almost ready to announce the availability of
"Axiom on the Web" more widely to the axiom-users list. I'd like to get =
some
"real" user feedback :). Let me know if you think of anything else I =
should
worry about first.

There is a diff below and the files are at

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Products/LatexWiki/ReplaceInlineAxio=
m.p
y
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Products/LatexWiki/axiomWrapper.py

I also spent far too much time tonight trying to figure out the font
problems with LatexWiki inside Plone 2. I am totally frustrated about it =
and
have decided to wait until I can upgrade to the newer versions of Zwiki =
and
LatexWiki. I even have problems printing from Plone. The font sizes =
change
radically, some text is cut-off on the right margin and so are the LaTeX
images. Have you seen this sort of printing problem before?

Regards,
Bill Page.

re: compiler quiet options.

These don't exist but we could modify the system to have a )quiet option.
Unless you knew the code would compile, however, you might miss 
informative messages.

Thanks, Tim for putting this as request 9581.  Would it be easier then to
provide a lisp command (maybe there is even already one) that duplicates the
)sys cat function? or some piping mechanism back to lisp? (Is the command )read
working with terminal i/o from lisp or does it also start a new shell?)

Unless, of course, if there are other )sys commands that one wants to capture
... I can think of commands like ls or ps but these seem not to be as critical
for documentation as cat.

I think there are better ways to achieve the same results (spool
commands=20
on unix, X-Term session capture etc.) than to change Axiom. With the
)sys command you can call an editor or a shell which will not work
within a pipe -- at least not as expected.

With best regards

Tim, Bob,

I have begun converting some of the AXIOM book to "wiki" form on
the portal. For the most part I am able to cut-and-paste the
contents of the book LaTeX file directly into the wiki pages.
Some of the LaTeX coding has to be modified, but it doesn't
take very long - mostly getting rid of the simulated Axiom
output since it is now generated automatically by Axiom itself.
To make the editing a little easier I have made a few more
improvements to the Axiom interface. Now I think it is pretty
solid and I would like to advertise it to the rest of the
Axiom user group and a few other places. Tim, is that ok with
you?

Anyway, take a look at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/refs/books/axiombook

and especially the Graphics section at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/refs/books/axiombook/Graphics

The Axiom graphics Draw program is actually called in this
worksheet but as you know the part that converts the Axiom
intermediate stuff to postscript is not quite ready yet. So
the graphic is actually generated from the same postscript file
that is used in the book. I was quite pleased by how the graphic
looks on the web!

Bob, because of the printing problems in Plone I was motivated
to upgraded the system to the most recent version of LatexWiki. I
had no problems at all, but unfortunately printing still doesn't
work properly from a Zwiki inside of Plone. Is this a know problem?

If/when you have an updated version of LatexWiki which includes
the Axiom interface, please let me know and I will give it a try
here. Be sure to get the most recent version of the source since
I have been continuing to make small changes to it.

Regards,
Bill Page.

You are not getting the latexwiki stylesheet.  Did you install latexwiki
in the quick installer?

What do you mean "printing doesn't work".  What goes wrong?  (don't have
a printer here at home to test right now...)

Be aware that mozilla has a bug in which it can't print transparent
PNG's...it prints them as solid black instead.  IE prints okay but the
resolution differences mean that the math looks really crappy.  It seems
printing from plone looks ultra crappy anyway.

I envision a true latex backend for Structured Text which will
dynamically create ps or pdf for printing, rather than expecting the web
browser to do everything correctly.

If you are up to figuring out darcs, you can create patches against my
darcs repository http://bob.mcelrath.org/darcs/latexwiki.  See
http://zwiki.org/ZWikiDarcs for some info on it.  Otherwise send me
updated patches or put them on the web somewhere.  ;)

Tim,

I tried for several times to make an update with "cvs update" but the

Wolfgang,

I just tried it again with a clean system. Try the following:

cvs -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/axiom co axiom/src/graph

and let me know if you get the src/graph subdirectory.

Tim

Since there hasn't been any discussions of the long term goal of
the axiom wiki I guess it's normal to see things move in surprising
directions. Here are some of the thoughts that Bill's work inspire.

Axiom is based entirely on pamphlet files. Pamphlet files are just
standard latex with a couple extras to support "inline" code in
the file. They are the basis of the literate programming style in
Axiom. So every file in Axiom is a pamphlet. I'm not familiar with
the details of "pagetypes" but perhaps a pamphlet pagetype is needed.

If the Axiom wiki effort can support pamphlet <=> webpage translations
it would have two benefits. First it would provide an interesting
front-end to Axiom, especially with Bill's automation of running
Axiom on a wiki web page. This turns out to be nearly as powerful
as Mathematica and Maple notebooks. In fact, with some clever web
page buttons we could probably reproduce their complete functionality.

If web pages could be converted to, or written originally on the wiki as,
pamphlet files then it would be possible to maintain Axiom directly on
the wiki which would practically be a research breakthru. It would
eliminate the hard-to-use CVS mechanism, enable people to use Axiom
directly as a "service" and encourage open math development on the wiki.

I've been struggling with the issue of how to develop a browsing 
structure for Axiom's pamphlet and this wiki has great potential
to solve that problem in a truly novel way.

Axiom uses a fairly limited range of Latex mostly because my Latex
talents are limited. Support for the \begin{array} environment or
the \begin{thebibliography} environment are about the most difficult 
of the parts of the Latex used. (Actually, if the \bibitems in a 
bibliography were automatically turned into hyperlinks that would
be sweet).

In any case the whole Axiom wiki idea opens up a lot of excellent,
creative directions that I think we need to explore further.

Tim

Currently, as you know, code is delimited in axiom's pamphlet files
using a special "chunk" syntax:

<<chunk name>>=                             <<== define code here
     code
@

and it gets expanded when the "chunk name" gets referenced:

<<chunk name>>                              <<== expand code here


It occurs to me that we could easily make this more "latex-like" thus:

\begin{chunk}[chunk name]
    code
\end{chunk}

\expand{chunk}[chunk name]


This would be "pseudo-latex" because the only difference between the
current chunk naming method and the latex-like chunk naming method
is syntactic. The pamphlet file would still expand exactly as before.
Only the program that collects and expands chunks (noweb) needs to change.

If we move to the latex syntax then it would be easy to define latex
environment macros which would do something harmless.

Another point of inspiration, at least for me, it that Axiom isn't
the only computer algebra system using pamphlets. Magnus is a
special purpose computer algebra system in infinite group theory
that also is using the pamphlet machinery.

Who knows, with the right advertising, perhaps we could convince
Maxima to do the same. That would make all of these systems useful
in a web environment in the relatively near term.

Latex has a command \write18{SHELL COMMAND} which will directly run
shell commands.  This is disabled by default and must be enabled by
'latex -shell-escape' I don't know about successive inputs to axiom.  I
take it pamphlet files are pre-processed by some tool?

Clever use of \write18 combined with some named pipes or temporary files
to corral output could enable latex itself to run axiom and include its
output in the resultant ps.  This could be done in a style file using
the latex-like syntax you suggest below.  If we were super-clever, we
would make the syntax the same for the web stuff...

\begin{axiom}
  code
\end{axiom}

Obviously, this can be a HUGE security hole, and I would not want people
to be able to edit documents on-line that can run arbitrary commands on
the server.  However it suggests a uniform document format...

A PageType is a ZWiki construct that encapsulates an input format such
as StructuredText, HTML, StructuredText + LaTeX, etc.  See
ZWiki/pagetypes.

The format I have been using is StructuredText + LaTeX.  Let me give a
little history on this before you all go converting documents en
masse...  StructuredText (stx) is a big hack of formatting rules piled
on top of one another using regexes.  It is not well-defined as a
structured grammar.  (Though I have been working on this)  For instance
it has no well-defined mechanism to escape markup.  If you play with it
long enough you WILL run into bugs, particularly when mixing escaping
mechanisms (! for stx, \ for latex).  It is nice because it ignores HTML
markup embedded in stx, so you can mix the two.  It is simple enough
that anyone can write it, but really, it is a toy.  I would not want to
base a large project or documentations system around it.  Eventually its
design limitations will become a hinderance.

reStructuredText (rst) is an attempt to more formally define the
grammar.  However its rules differ significantly from StructuredText,
and it uses the backslash as an escape character, meaning mixing latex
with it may be difficult.  However as it is a defined grammar one would
need to add latex syntax (including math) rules.  If someone wants to
investigate further this would be interesting.

This leaves pure latex as an input format.  Now, clearly, pure latex is
an appropriate and powerful input format for documentation.  latex2html
can already generate html (though it is archaic and equations are poorly
aligned -- but we can work on that).  There is also the tex4ht variant
of latex2html which can output mathml.  This is all done using latex
commands and style files, and is rather slow.  Appropriate
web-representation would mean:

    1) separate the Big Book into individual pages (chapters?)
    2) hyperlinking
    3) referencing/footnoting
    4) in-page hyperlinking for equations a la existing latexwiki?

So I see a couple options for all this:

    1) Use a front-end to convert pamphlet files to a web-appropriate
    format (stx + latex or rst + latex)

    2) Use latex all around, defining a new pagetype.  The pagetype does
    not have to be axiom specific, but it could be.

I think the existing stx+latex can co-exist with a pure latex format.
Users can "play" with stx+latex, and more formal documentation can be
written in straight latex and placed on the web (but would not be
user-editable -- this also alleviates the security concern I mentioned
earlier if \write18 is used).

Have you looked at Mozilla's XUL?

    http://www.xulplanet.com/

Since Mozilla already knows about MathML, a complete user interface for
a computer algebra system could be implemented in a totally
platform-independent way inside mozilla, running the axiom process
locally or remotely...

Don't underestimate the usefulness of the CVS revision-and-patch
mechanism.  I've been using darcs lately (better-than-cvs replacement)
and it does this very nicely, incorporating things into logical
patchsets which can be exchanged.  Placing files on the wiki and
allowing multiple editors would result in many small edits, and it
becomes difficult to track down (and possibly revert) dangerous changes.

Especially with mathematical content, changes should be encapsulated in
logical units, carefully reviewed by experts, and run through numerous
test cases to ensure mathematical correctness.

It also gets indexed by google.

This is something that has been on my TODO list for LatexWiki for a
while.

Bob,

Axiom uses noweb (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb)
as its literate programming tool. Historically Knuth constructed
a program called "Web" for literate programming, to support the
coding of Tex, I believe. He wanted to integrate the explanation
with the code.

Web has two tools, "TANGLE" which takes a literate program and
produces source code and "WEAVE" which takes a literate program
and produces TeX output. Web worked only with Pascal code.

CWeb is the same idea using C.

noweb is the same idea but generalizes Web to be language independent.
noweb uses "NOWEAVE" to generate TeX output and "NOTANGLE" to extract
"chunks". (Chunks are just named blocks that get stuck in a hash table
when they are defined. They get expanded when the name is used).

Axiom was completely rewritten to use a literate programming style
that combines code and documentation in one document we call a pamphlet.
(noweb calls these .nw files). So there are no C, Lisp, Spad, Makefile,
tex, or any other files left. Everything is a pamphlet combining code
and documentation.

So the current process is:

noweave foo.pamphlet >foo.tex
latex foo.tex

notangle foo.pamphlet >foo.c
gcc foo.c

for each and every file that makes up Axiom. 

This means that every source file is also a document. These documents
are automatically generated and live under mnt/linux/doc in the
distribution. 

There are thousands of these documents.

So several interesting issues arise which Bill's work could address.

First, the system is documented by a book (src/doc/book.pamphlet).
Bill is working to put this book online. In particular, he is
automatically recreating the Axiom output which is a very wide
range of test cases. 

Second, chapter 9 of the book is a small selection of the 1100 domains.
All of these domains are documented (poorly) under mnt/linux/doc/algebra
which is where the latex output is placed. If chapter 9 was restructured
carefully we could have all of the domains documented.

Third, since there are several thousand files the need for some
sort of structuring mechanism (search, hierarchy, crosslinks) arises.
Browser technology gives all of this a common front end. And .dvi
files can contain hyperlink information (some of the \bibitem entries
are hyperlink format already). Bill and I, and others, have talked
about forming the lattice of the algebra code. Such a lattice would
make at least one good structuring mechanism for the mathematics.
Javadoc style navigation output is another possibility. Even simple
alphabetic order access to domain documentation would be useful.

Fourth, other systems, such as Mathematica have notebooks which contain
code to demonstrate how to use Mathematica in a new domain such as
control theory. I can see developing web pages to explain control
theory backed by Axiom code. Indeed, the example I'm pursuing at
the moment, learning about Clifford algebra, is a case in point.
(http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki/June32004).

Fifth, work is going on in another thread to develop another Axiom
book based on Littlewood's book. Assuming the copyright permission
is given we can release this on the wiki. This would be an experiment
in "open editing" a book related to the mathematics that is essential
to understanding Axiom. 

Sixth, Axiom generates graphics. With some help from Luanne, who
understands how to create Flash files, it should be possible to 
generate Flash graphics so that equations can "evolve in time".
That is, you could run a program to create Flash which shows 
how a function might evolves. This would be useful in many areas
(trivially you could automate a 3D wave function and watch it
undulate).

The range of ideas goes on but from these beginning examples you can
understand why the work Bill and you are doing is really a great
breakthru.

Tim

I spent a year involved in XML and its cousins. I realize that the
browser world is moving to XML based systems and we need to evolve
with it. That said, I'm not the right person to lead in that direction.
User interface work is a talent (like scheduling software) that I lack.
So I'm willing to help and to understand but I'm incapable of making
anything user-affectionate :-). 

I will look at the XUL site though. Thanks.

Oh, CVS (or arch if I can get it working again) will still be used
for Axiom code. But it would be possible to add new code to Axiom
online and build test cases without damaging anything. And if the
resulting page were (by fortune or design) a near-pamphlet it would
be easy to "promote it into the official Axiom CVS".

That works! Thank you. Though, I would like to understand why the "normal" cvs
update doesn't do it ...

Perhaps because you didn't use the -d option of the update command, as in
cvs update -d

>From cvs(1):

       -d

         Create  any directories that exist in the repository if they're miss-
         ing from the  working  directory.   Normally,  update  acts  only  on
         directories  and  files  that  were  already enrolled in your working
         directory.

         This is useful for updating directories  that  were  created  in  the
         repository since the initial checkout; but it has an unfortunate side
         effect.  If you  deliberately  avoided  certain  directories  in  the
         repository  when  you  created your working directory (either through
         use of a module name or by listing explicitly the files and  directo-
         ries you wanted on the command line), then updating with -d will cre-
         ate those directories, which may not be what you want.

Thanks!

Ok, after a long struggle I now have the AxiomWiki stuff working
with the newest versions of both Zwiki and LatexWiki ... many
long steps mostly related to the images directory relative
path problem (again) which I did not recognize at first and
then some changes in the Axiom interface code to use the
right method to get the full path names. Phew!

After all that, the printing from IE is muct better :) however
it is still cut-off a bit on the right hand side. Any ideas
about what might be causing this? This didn't happen when
printing from Zope/Zwiki with IE in the versions of Zwiki
and LatexWiki. I have attached a sample pdf file created by
IE from

=20
http://page.axiom-developer.org:9080/refs/books/axiombook/NumericComputat=
ion

I can send you the patches against your version of LatexWiki
in darcs, if you like. I am not yet familiar enough with
darcs to know how to do it directly.

In the process of debugging, I also setup a fully separate
test environment on axiom-developer.org so as not to
disturb what's working so far and what I am about to
announce more widely. This will make it easier to test new
versions and changes. When I am sure that the test version
is working, then I will migrate it to the "production"
version.

The url for the test version (Plone only so far) is:

  http://axiom-developer.org:9080

>=20

No I didn't change it. The funny thing is that they appear
just a little too high in IE but a little too low in Mozilla.
For example check this

  http://page.axiom-developer.org:9080/Members/billpage/TestWiki

in both browsers.

Doesn't this happen in the Zope and Plone 1 versions?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I don't understand why normal cvs doesn't do it either.
Perhaps because CVS is working from the list of local directories
and this is a new directory. I'm sure it is a misunderstanding
on my part as this is too large an error not to have been found
before.

In any case, I'm glad it works.

0.32 will use the full path for the LocalFS images/ by default.  Is
there anything I need to fix here?

I don't know what to tell you about printing.  I note that printing
pages from moz also looks crappy.  In fact, printing pages from the
official plone site in moz looks crappy.  (cut off at right, strange
indenting, embedded URL's)  It might be possible to fix this in
plonePrint.css.  Printing URL's is due to that stylesheet:
    div.document a:visited:after {
           content: " ( " attr(href) " ) ";
    }

I think for a documentation system we should eventualy strive to produce
postscript/pdf from wiki pages, and not depend on the browser.  TeX has
decades of history of producing good-looking output.  It will be a very
long time before browsers catch up.

Use 'darcs send' and give it my email.  The other way to do it is put
your repository on the web and I can pull from it.

IE is bugged.  It implements 'vertical-align: middle' improperly.
Mozilla and Konqueror do it right, it appears that Opera does it wrong.
I started writing some javascript to work around this:
    http://mcelrath.org/imgalignx3.html
If I can get this to work cross-browser I'll include it in the next
release.  (If someone knows javascript -- please play with this -- I'm
shooting in the dark with this)

Your site is generating different images than mine, despite the fact
that the parameters are the same.  What version of ghostscript and PIL
do you have?  Compare:
    http://mcelrath.org:9674/Plone2/UserOptions
    http://axiom-developer.org:9080/Members/mcelrath/UserOptions
as you indicate, your site is making images that are a slightly
different size, and have different amount of space around the letters.
I have ghostscript 7.07 on one computer and 7.07.1 on another (and the
images those two generate are identical).

> Doesn't this happen in the Zope and Plone 1 versions?

This is not a zope or plone problem, as the images we are generating are
different.  It must be one of: latex, dvips, ghostscript, or PIL.

No, what you wrote in LatexWiki is fine. I just had solved the
path name problem a little differently while getting the
previous version to work and I did not recognize the difference
in my code at first. And I didn't have adequate error checking.

------

While on the subject of image path names, I would like to
propose a change in the way the LocalFS directory is set up
and in the image URLs. What we have now is

  http://computer/path/images/name.png

In the URL what I would like to see is this

  http://computer/images/path/name.png


In other words, we should move the "images" directory *before*
the path rather than after it the way it appears now and the
corresponding file name should include the path. It would be

  workingDir/LatexWiki/path/name.png

Only the LatexWiki directory, and the LocalFS name 'images'
which maps to it, need to be created at installation time
(as it is now). But if the additional directories in
workingDir/LatexWiki/path do not yet exist, then I they
should to be automatically created.  This would mean that
sub-directory structure of workingDir/LatexWiki in the file
system would match the corresponding structure in Zope. PNG
files would be located in the directory corresponding to
the folder where the Zwiki page resides that references them.
In a environment (such as Plone) where there might be many
different folders containing wiki pages, this allows the
images to be grouped into smaller more efficient groups.

But more importantly for Axiom, the images directory is also
where the compiled library files are saved. Having a sub-
directory corresponding to each user or system folder that
contains an wiki page with Axiom library code would insure
that all of these environments saw their own working
environments - allowing different users to create and
maintain different versions of library packages with the
same name.

Another thing related thing that I am planning to do is
to enable the Apache front-end (which currently talks to
Zope by reverse proxy) to access the PNG files in the images
directory directly via a rewrite rule. This is quite easy
and would likely lead to a large improvement in the speed
of delivery of the images. This way we take advantage of
the fact that we actually store the images in the file
system rather than in the ZopeDB.

Yes, I see the difference. It is especially obvious in Mozilla.

We could define a new page type, but right now what I have done
is just extend the functionality of the existing StructuredText+LaTeX
and HTML+LaTeX page types to include the Pamphlet-style "code-chunk"
concept /begin{axiom} ... /end{axiom} and the ability to run Axiom
itself.

As a user of both of these commercial systems, I would say that
in some ways the Axiom Wiki interface is already superior -
especially when it comes to online web-based collaborative
computer algebra. And since it allows full access to LaTeX,
it's ability to display mathematics is also superior to both
M and M.

In fact this is *already* possible with what has been implemented.
It would be quite easy to load all of the existing Axiom algebra
pamphlet files as Axiom Wiki pages in an "algebra" folder. Editing
these pages would cause the .spad files to be created in the
LatexWiki "images" folder/directory. These spad files could then
be accessed as part of the Axiom build script.

And with a simple extension to the current "images" folder naming
conventions (discussed in a previous email to Bob), this would
also allow people to maintain there own separate variants of the
algebra.

I agree completely! For example the Search box at the top right
hand corner of the portal page allows you to search for Axiom
Wiki "pamphlet" files based on their content. One can easily
insert links between these pages using the standard wiki
conventions.

This shouldn't be too hard (in principle). But I also agree with
Bob's previous point about not necessarily trying to (or maybe
even deliberately not to) reproduce all of the LaTeX functionality.
Some things are more easily done a new way (StructuredText).

Great. Let's do it. :)

I thought that I should also mention that it is quite easy to
install the Zope+ZWiki+LatexWiki+AxiomWiki combination on a
stand alone machine with Axiom. (Plone is optional but some
people might find it useful as a "personal organizer" for
other research materials.) The result is that one can use a
standard web browser to access this locally - no network
required. There is a trend to use the browser interface as
a standard gui instead of writing gui applications in the
traditional way.

The result of this combination is rather similar to but with
greater functionality than the Texmacs interface to Axiom.
And since these same tools are already available on windows
once we have Axiom running on Windows, we will automatically
have a fully compatible gui for Windows.

One of the nice things about using Axiom this way is how
easy it would be to share Axiom worksheets with other users.
Zope has facility for exporting and importing web pages
from one site to another.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Greetings!  I made a small typo in my original 20040705 package which
means I have to do another upload.  Given this opportunity, I'm
wondering what should be done about the new graphics items.  I
understand that they are not yet callable from axiom proper.  So
perhaps we should leave them out of the package for the time being.
If they are to be included, I'm not sure if they logically belong in a
separate package or should be bundled with the main binary.  The
latter option will make axiom require X and any libraries used, etc.,
while the former will relegate such dependency to an optional add on.

If viewAlone is to be regarded a standalone binary, then I need to
either write or generate a manpage for it according to Debian policy. 

src/graph/viewports is an empty directory on CVS checkout, and (I
think therefore) is absent on cvs export.  But
src/graph/Makefile.pamphlet tries to make a doc/viewports directory
from this directory.

While it is uncertain how much time remains before the next Debian
stable release, the signs are that it is approaching rather soon.  The
major obstacle was removed recently by a developer vote.  Once
released, it is likely that two or three years will lapse before the
next Debian stable.  Needless to say, I'd like axiom to be as solid
therein as possible.  This of course is not to rush axiom development
in any way -- rather I'm just seeking advice on how axiom should be
presented in this release that is likely to be with us a long time.

Also, if there is any item that is a reasonably low hanging fruit that
needs picking in axiom within this time frame, perhaps I can help. 

Take care,
--

Bill,

Could you tar up an installable package?
I'd like to download it and put it onto one of my standalone machines
so I can get familiar with the details.

Actually, I have thought about this a little more and what
I think might be better is something like this

  http://computer/LatexWiki/path/images/name.png

There would be just one LocalFS map to the

  workingDir/LatexWiki

sub-directory. Then Axiom could use names like this

  http://computer/LatexWiki/path/axiom/name.spad

This would have the benefit of keeping the interesting

One can create more than one LocalFS repository.  I would suggest a
totally separate 'axiom' LocalFS directory for this.

Having LatexWiki put all its images in one directory allows for caching.
I.e. if two unrelated pages both have $x$, it only gets rendered once.
Your proposals would have it rendered twice if the path was different.

Yes, I see your point. I hadn't thought about how LatexWiki
caches images based on the LaTeX code that generated them.
I agree that the repository of LaTeX generated images plays a
very different role than the files generated for Axiom. In fact
this sort of caching doesn't make sense for Axiom's output since
the relationship of an Axiom command to the LaTeX output it
generates is not fixed. A separate LocalFS directory and a
separate way of constructing file names makes sense.

Thanks.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Whether you should include the latest src/graph tree I leave that up to you.
Due to a huge push on Magnus I'm unable to complete the integration of the
graphics in the next couple weeks. If you want to remove the src/graph
tree you can just comment it out in the src/Makefile.pamphlet. It is 
pretty self-contained I believe.

Before graphics is fully integrated I need to recover sman which is another
subtree. That's the next "recovery" push. I have some vacation time coming
up in august so I hope to make a lot of progres then but that will probably
be too late for sarge.

I have a couple local things that are ready to update such as adding
test cases, redoing the document command, further graphics updates,
etc. but none of them are worth worrying about.

Dear All,

	I have some troubles to build AXIOM after having newly indstalled
a recent linux, SuSE9.1.

	First, I would have been helpfull, if, say ./configure, would tell
one that certain x11 *.h files are needed. I found them finally in
XFree86-devel, since I had this problem earlier.

	Second, some GMP sub configuration of GCL-2.6.2a things went
wrong, which I was not able to resolve, see log attached below.

Any help welcome
BF.

in the README:

FAQ 1: Xlib.h is not found

You need to have Xlib.h to build the graphics. If you are building
on a RedHat 8 system you need to install the following RPM:

  rpm -i XFree86-devel-4.2.0-72.i386.rpm

On Debian GNU/Linux, the package 'xlibs-dev' is needed.

The second failure you report is more obscure. 

It appears that saved_pre_gcl (a lispish image) did not build
or is not executable. This is a GCL lisp failure.

Is there a possibility to go for an older GCL, just uncommenting them in
the makefile?

will try...

Dear All,

	after failing to build AXIOM on SuSE9.1, I tried to build teh
GCL-2.6.1 and GCL-2.6.2(a) directly from their directory. Actually, I did
a
> ./configure (which worked out)
> make
which stoped with the error

cp: cannot stat `gmp3/gmp.h' : No such file or directory

actually the directory gmp3 does not contain such or similar files

Hence also my attempt to use an older GCL to build AXIOM, changed the
Makefile of AXIOM, failed....

I have no idea what went wrong....

This makes no sense to me. 

I could be that some config switch is defaulting a different way
based on SUSE. I'll look at the GCL config file and see if there is a 
comment that makes sense.

The GCL files are in the zips subdirectory.
If you go to that directory type:

cd zips
tar -ztf gcl-2.6.2a.tgz | fgrep gmp.h

and the file should be there.

I get
	gcl/h/mgmp.h
hence not the desired file and hence not in the gmp3 directory. This is
however true for GCL 2.6.1, 2.6.2 and 2.6.2a, so this might be the correct
location, so why is the make looking for a different file....

By the way, could the README file of AXIOM be split into two file. The
README and a FQA file. I was scrolling down the README file and stopped
when I saw license busines (not assuming something technical coming below)

curious. I've just did a clean checkout and am building it here to see
if it fails on RedHat. 

My system runs config, creates config.m4 which says:
....
config.status: creating gmp.h
...

beyond that it is building normally. So I suspect there is some test
in the config mechanism that is failing in SUSE. I'm trying to read
the config mechanism now.

Sure, I can split them out. The license business is at the top because
we're all lawyers first and programmers second :-) You'll also notice
that there is a license at the top of every source file (about like 
putting a license and patent information on every car part). Sorry,
the whole legal thing just sets me off.... all further discussion of
this will be on axiom-legal.

Maybe the problem is that you haven't installed m4?

Hi,

Here is a patch (diff -Naur) for Makefile.pamphlet (07/01/2004) in
src/algebra:

Change:

RINTERP DenavitHartenbergMatrix

by

RINTERP RationalInterpolation

Question:

Why RINTERP is not added to "exposed.lsp.pamphlet" in Hidden section ?



Cheers, Greg

BF,

> what is m4?

m4 is a macro language. m4 is usually installed as a side-effect
of installing sendmail.

In general, the build-dependencies for gcl can be found at the head of
the file debian/control in the gcl source directory.  Currently, they
are:

Build-Depends: debhelper ( >= 4.1.0 ), emacs21 | emacsen, libreadline4-dev, m4, tk8.4-dev, tetex-bin, texinfo, binutils-dev, libgmp3-dev, autotools-dev

You can forget about the debhelper unless you want to make a Debian
package.

Take care,

Tim,

graphviz looks like it produces really nice graphs.

I have been experimenting with the "TouchGraph" online graphical
interface for the Axiom Wiki. You can start to play with it here.

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage/withNavigator

I don't really have enough example files in this part of the Axiom
Wiki yet to really illustrate this well, but I hope you can get the
idea. 

You might remember that I mentioned this back in April

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-04/msg00015.html

The people to implemented this (Mathis Heydtmann and Alex@floop.org.uk)
provided some fairly detailed documentation on how to set it up here

http://zeck.floop.org.uk/mathis/WikiLiver/InstallingZWikiNavigator

Nice work gentlemen!

It only took me a few hours today to get this to work.

Right now I am working the DHmatrix.spad.pamphlet file as an example.
I intend to gradually put more of the .pamphlet files here so that
we can experiment with this sort of "crystal navigation".

Comments welcome, everyone!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill,

Thanks for your interest in our Wikinavigator. 
(http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-04/msg00015.html)
I have to credit mainly Alex@floop.org.uk for developing it with me and we
are hoping to develop it further... We are currently working on packaging it
and go public in some way also with the aim to get more people involved for
testing on different browsers, ... Watch the space.

> graphviz looks like it produces really nice graphs.

I'm going to try to revive the effort to define and graph the
axiom algebra lattice. This will make it somewhat easier to 
understand and show where more work is needed. Hopefully an
interesting research direction will fall out that can be 
proposed for the next round of submissions.

I've looked at your graphics visualization software
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz)
and read the license. It seems compatible with the
Modified BSD license that we use for Axiom
(http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom)
although I can't say that I fully understand all
the possible legal ramifications.

One item of note is that changes are supposed to be
sent back to AT&T but it doesn't say where and to whom.

The general mechanism that Axiom uses with software is to
distribute the original tarball unchanged. During the build
process patches are dynamically applied. This is compatible
with your license as I understand it. We need to know, if
we do make changes, where to send copies of these patches.

In addition, we have a wiki website. If we find this software
useful we're likely to extend it to handle hyperlinking to our
source files. This is non-commercial use and does not involve
distribution in any physical sense. Nevertheless, we're willing
to contribute patches back to the original project.

Please send me a contact name and email address for patches.

Dear Axiom fans,

I am wanting to produce new versions for my Real Closure package and I am
willing to use Open Axiom while I was mainly using NAG's Axion version.

I am using my RealClosure package which is the same for Open Axiom than the
one I use in NAG's Axiom 2.3 since Tim downloaded the RECLOS version from my
website.

I am however experiencing efficiency problems. Here is an example:

----------------Open Axiom-------------------------------

I have no idea but I'll look into it.

I'll try running the same test here. In particular, I'll recompile
the sources in each image before the tests so I'm sure they are
using the same code.

Tim

Renaud, Tim,

Has the version of OpenAxiom that you are using been
"compiled twice" in order to optimize function calls?
(Although if not, I doubt that that could explain a
factor of 1000!)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hum, this is beyond my control. 

The only problem I had when compiling axiom was :

1 finished /usr/local/Install/OpenAxiom/axiom/src/doc
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Install/OpenAxiom/axiom/src/doc'
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/local/Install/OpenAxiom/axiom/src/graph/Makefile.pamphlet', needed by `/usr/local/Install/OpenAxiom/axiom/src/graph/Makefile'.  Stop.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Install/OpenAxiom/axiom/src'
make[1]: *** [srcdir] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Install/OpenAxiom/axiom'
make: *** [all] Error 2

but axiom seems to run and has the correct build date.

Stephen,

I've started writing a package for Axiom that will allow programs
to generate graphs. 

One thing to know about Axiom programs is that they are "literate
programs" meaning that they are actually TeX documents which contain
the source code as well as the documentation. Axiom no longer contains
C, lisp, spad, makefiles, etc. Everything is a TeX document from which
the programs are extracted at build time.

Rather than rewriting the relevant portions of the docs you provide
I'd rather just quote the text directly. I don't see anything in the
license that prevents that. Unfortunately, I also don't see the
original tex files that make up the documentation.

Several questions:

Is it clear to you that the license allows me to quote the docs?
Are the tex documents available? It would save retyping the parts.
If so, where can I get them?
Will they be made part of the distribution?

Thanks,
Tim

Stephen,

> Aren't they in the doc directory?

The pdf files are there but the tex sources are not.
Pdf is basically a binary, dead-end format.

I want to write an Axiom version of the tex that has axiom source
code spread all over the file. For instance, in the dotguide file
there is an example of how to create a simple digraph. To incorporate
this into axiom I'd rewrite the section to show what the related
axiom functions are (including their implementation), as well as
the output of an axiom session (which would automatically become
a regression test case). That way the documentation covers both
the source (as it is extracted), the testing (also extracted) and
the end user documentation (automatically built). Besides the
existing documentation I'd be writing a discussion of the design
decisions and the implementation details. That way future maintainers
can understand and maintain the code, tests, and docs all in one place.

You can fetch files from the Axiom website to see what I mean:

cvs -d:ext:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/axiom co axiom/src/algebra/dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet

I extract code and docs using a tool called noweb
(http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb) written by Norman Ramsey at
Harvard. It is a language-agnostic version of Knuth's Web literate
programming tool.

I can write all of this documentation from scratch but it's just
so much easier to start with existing work and slice and dice it.

Tim

Ok. Got it. The CVS does contain the tex but the tarball does not.
I'll tar up the CVS version and use that, per the license.
Thanks.

Are you sure you have used -d option to cvs update? A missing
directory/file could explain such an error.

Tim, Renaud,

I have tried a simple example on the Axiom Wiki here

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/ExperimentHere

It is based on Renaud's email, but I do not have the actual
value that he may have used for the variable a2.

Anyway, it seems that at least in the verion of Axiom on
the Axiom Wiki, the performance is pretty good!

If you have any questions about how to use the Axiom Wiki
and the Axiom Portal, please ask.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello Mark,

I cannot remember if anybody has replied to your questions, so I give
them a try:

"Mark E. Fenner" <fenner@cs.pitt.edu> writes:

Axiom has its own Lisp to have a known the build environment and because
Axiom needs to patch the lisp core system for its own purpose (socket
extension). This might change in the future but is not in the short term
plan. 

However, it is possible to make Axiom rely on an external Lisp
(GCL). Camm Maguire is doing it for the Debian Axiom package.

You should use the default lisp in the current sources of Axiom.

The docs need updates. We will gladly accept any diff -Naur of your
patch.

Yours,
d.

"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."
"Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the
skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That parchment,
being scribbled o'er should undo a man? Some say the bee stings; but
I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I
was never mine own man since" -- Shakespeare Henry VI, part 2

You're right, of course. 

Thus, I need to figure out a way to configure a non-free extension
that is left out of the free distribution. Or wait for AT&T to get a 
clue. For the nonce, I choose path one as path two can never occur
for certainly AT&T can have no love of Modified BSD :-)

"Oh, bother" -- Pooh

BTW, any further discussion on the legal subject should be copied
ONLY to axiom-legal, and NOT axiom-developer, that being the point 
of its creation.

One of the developers has agreed to look at UFFI (if memory serves)
which is rumored to allow C extensions to all of the Lisp systems.
If I have the cover functions for Axiom's GCL extensions then I can
use a pre-installed lisp if such exists.

The current GCLVERSION should read
GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.2a

although the patches are still there for the prior versions and they
used to work.

I ran both the NAG version and the free version of Axiom on 
reclos.input. These are the two consoles. The first one is
from the NAG version, the second from the free version.

The times compare reasonably.

Please send me the test case you have.

Greetings!  Just a quick note on an observation I've made in putting
together the latest Debian package.  As you may recall, we are
skipping the database rebuilding step on ia64, alpha, hppa, mips and
mipsel, as we cannot natively relocate objects on these machines yet,
and they therefore use dlopen, which takes up too many file handles in
this step.  Even were this surmounted, another difficulty would arise
-- all the algebra files are compiled with the filename "code.lsp"
before renaming the .o file as appropriate.  This names the lisp
initialization function in each object "init_code", causing a linker
conflict, and results in a failure to find the sought init functions
determined by filename at load time, e.g. init_AHYB, etc.

We do intend to  get native relocation on these machines, but it will
likely take considerable time.  Might it be quicker to rename the
code.lsp before compiling?

Take care,

Dear Axiom lovers,

The issue I had with the version of my Real Closure Package is solved. I was
not using the same sources for the different versions.

The issue came because version 1.1 was released too early with Axiom 2.3 and
still contained problems. When I fixed a bug in January, I fixed it from the
NAG version and not from my version which contains more code.

I have sent Tim the new version. Here is the example I used. It is due to John
Abott.

Ran := RECLOS(FRAC INT)
)se me ti on
a0 := sqrt(2,3)$Ran
a1 := sqrt(-(399063623035 - 316737007504*a0),3)
a2 := sqrt(-(5539 - 92526953*a1),3)
a3 := sqrt(-(5739 - 9473525*a2),3)
a4 := sqrt(-(1 - 1283*a3),3)
a5 := sqrt(-(4579804 - 191560867*a4),3)
a6 := sqrt(-(49400 - 220877349*a5),3)

------------------computation of a5 with Axiom 2.3------------------
                                           Type: RealClosure Fraction Integer
                         Time: 34.60 (EV) + 0.01 (OT) + 1.12 (GC) = 35.73 sec
------------------computation of a5 with Axiom 2.3------------------

and 

------------------computation of a5 with Open Axiom------------------
                                           Type: RealClosure Fraction Integer
                                     Time: 35.60 (EV) + 7.96 (GC) = 43.56 sec
------------------computation of a5 with Open Axiom------------------

Thanks to all of you for your help.

		Renaud

> could you please give me some suggestion why my DUP is slower than SUP

This is a significant pile of code you sent. You have to hand-optimize
each line rather than copy SUP. It has nothing to do with fixnum
arithmetic. The difference between an SUP and a DUP representation is
the key to speedups.

In general, a dense representation will be slower than a sparse
representation for the simple reason that the dense representation has
more terms. Given good code I'd expect sparse to outperform dense in
almost every case.

If the sparse representation does an O(1) lookup (such as an array
access or hash table) for terms then it should be approximately as
fast as the dense representation in the worst case. This won't be true
in practice because a dense representation can assume the index of the
next term and can use a straight loop to walk terms. Thus a dense
representation can do:

  for i in 0..maxterm (process term i)

whereas a sparse representation must do

  for i in (lookup(term))..(lookup(term)) (process term i)

and thus the lookup speed is vital. Depending on the cost to process
a term this can be a dominant factor (e.g. adding terms) or not (e.g.
computing the integral of the term). 

Find all of the places where terms are accessed and make sure you
are fully using the fact that you know the bounds.

Another cost tradeoff is that a dense representation knows how large
the result must be whereas a sparse representation does not. So memory
allocation can be fast in a dense representation. If you assume worst
case terms in a sparse representation you can do a fast memory allocate,
collect the nonzero terms, and reallocate. By definition it's still
going to be more expensive. Thus a dense representation can do:

   allocate max memory
   compute all the terms

whereas a sparse does

   compute a term
   add it to a list (or whatever rep it uses)

or 
   allocate max memory
   compute the terms
   compute new memory bound
   allocate smaller memory
   copy the results
   deallocate max memory

So, did you find every place that SUP uses dynamic memory allocation
rather than fore-knowledge? 

Sparse representation can also be clever in storing the terms so
that maximum cancellation occurs (e.g. knowing that X=0 means
that you don't have to compute a lot of terms because they vanish).
To use this trick you need to know a lot about the domain and I
don't see SUP using it anywhere.

Mike,

Thank you very much for this observation. I am trying to plug such =
security
holes and have just added )lisp, )fin and )spool to the list of disabled
commands. If you try your test again you should see that it fails with a
reasonable error message.

It is a pity that we have to lock out lisp access. I wonder if anyone =
has
done any work on a "secure mode" for lisp?

About performance. This system collects all the Axiom commands embedded =
in a
web page and internally prepares a script that is run by Axiom as a =
batch.
The output is parsed and re-inserted back into the code for the web =
page.
This happens only once when the user clicks Save.

The LaTeX rendering done by the LatexWiki component which calls the
combination of latex+dvips+ghostscript is likewise done only once. =
Moreover
the images that it creates for inclusion in the final web page are =
cached
based on the LaTeX code that created them. These are keep in an "image
repository" so latex et al are never called more than once for each such
construct.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bertfried,

Maybe you were talking about your web page on the "test"
version at

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/Members/Bertfried/FrontPage

I just tried it and yes, it did not appear correctly. The
problem was that when I split the original version of the
Axiom portal into two versions - one for general use and
one for testing and development - I forgot that I had to
regenerate any of the previously existing pages.

What I just did was click Edit on this page, make a simple
change that forces LatexWiki to regenerate the page, and
click Save. Now it seems to look ok.

Is it ok for you now (on both page.axiom-developer and
on test.axiom-developer)?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Hi Bill,

everything works out now on both locations. Even AXIOM seems to work very
nicely in the sandbox <grin> You will however not be angry seeing me using
my local mashine and AXIOM <grin>

Is axiom available from teh Members/Bertfried  pages too, so that one
could display certain calculations? How can I upload files containing
AXIOM code for such examples?

ciao
BF.

Of course not. That's great.

Yes, Axiom is available on all pages that also support LaTeX
(only "wiki pages" with page type ...+Latex)

The simplest way to create a new page would be to first edit
the existing page and add a "wiki word", that is a word that
contains at least two capital letters LikeThis. When you click
Save, the page will be displayed with the word LikeThis? with
a question mark beside it. If you now click on that question
mark, a new page will be created named LikeThis.

Now to add some AXIOM code this page, the simplest way is
just to use cut-and-paste from the Axiom code displayed in
another window. You will have to edit it to include the

  \begin{axiom}
  ...
  \end{axiom}

and any other static LaTeX coding that you want.

Click Save. And that's it (unless there is an error of
course and then you just fix it and try again).

You can also go to "my folders" and if you like create a
new folder for some new work. Then just go to that folder
and Add a new wiki page. Now you have a place for stuff that
is separate from you main home page. And you can add as many
new pages here as you want using the same method as above.

I hope this helps.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Sometime in the last few versions I added the following to the top of
the LatexTemplate I distribute:

  %% This file is used as a python printf() string.  As such, the document we are
  %% trying to render is placed at the location of the percent-s below, and any
  %% comments in this file must be preceeded by TWO percent signs.

I'm not so fond of using LatexTemplate as a python printf string, and
would happily entertain other suggestions.

Secondly, when upgrading LatexWiki or ZWiki, one should run the
/upgradeAll method on the site, which will cause all pages to be
re-rendered.  If you get the latex alignment problem that we discussed
fixed, I suggest you delete the contents of the var/LatexWiki directory
(where the png's are), and run /upgradeAll, which will cause LatexWiki
to regenerate its images.

For a single page the method is /clearCache.  Run them like by appending
/upgradeAll or /clearCache to any wiki page like this:

    http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki/FrontPage/clearCache
    http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki/FrontPage/upgradeAll

Note that upgradeAll may take some time when your wiki becomes large,
especially when rendering lots of latex and axiom expressions!  I hope
to further improve the speed of ZWiki itself in the future.

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to comp.lang.lisp as well.

The GCL team is happy to announce the release of version 2.6.3, the
latest achievement in the 'stable' series. This release is a minor
modification to version 2.6.2, incorporating corrections to the few
errata discovered immediately after 2.6.2 was released.  From the
changelog:
     
       Correctly parse gcc version strings in gmp3 subconfigure on arm

       Fix variable capture error in dotimes macro

       Better sed separator for LI-CC in unixport/makefile

       Fix segfault in string-match

       vs_top=sup -> (reset-top) where possible in compiler

       Correct room report to show proper percentages when sgc is on

       Fix value stack leak in rare compiled call sequence

       Read in RELOC environment variable if set as default in debian/rules

       Remove local bfd libraries from libs variables as their objects are
       incorporated into libgcl and as the source directory may not be
       available at runtime

       Remove pcl/pcl_gazonk*lsp build-generated files from source
         
For the latest information, capabilities, and status of GCL stable,
please see the 2.6.2 release notes at

Camm,

which CVS command should I use to get 2.6.3?
does it have a different -r version?

Dear all,

for example,
I can make a 10 element array by using MAKE_-ARRAY(10)$Lisp
but how to specify those arguments?

make-array dimensions &key :element-type :initial-element :initial-contents
:adjustable :fill-pointer :displaced-to :displaced-index-offset

Thanks

You can't provide optional parameters to Lisp functions using $Lisp
because the Axiom interpreter doesn't understand the syntactic meaning
of ":".  You must either provide a Lisp cover function like e.g.:
)lisp (defun myarray (dims in-el) (make-array dims :initial-element in-el))
MYARRAY(10,1)$Lisp
or alternatively try to find an Axiom equivalent.  In this case it is
quite likely that the domain PrimitiveArray has the functionality you
need, for example the result of:
new(10,1)$PrimitiveArray(Integer)
is identical to that of myarray above.

Regards, Mike.

Question: Why do people want to call Lisp directly from the interpreter
directly? It seems counter-intuitive to me.

Write a boot function and load it at run time and then use Axiom syntax.

Greetings!  Just a further update.  The multiple filename code.lsp
resulting in the multiple function definition init_code also prevents
the performance rebuild of the system we're currently using in the
Debian package, (i.e. touch *.lisp *.lsp && make, loading the .fn
files this time.)

Take care,

Greetings!  Just a short note, as I've missed the head of this
thread.  Please bring to my attention any significant performance
deficiencies of open axiom vis a vis the NAG version.  Accompanying
any such by an as compact example as possible is always helpful.

Take care,

Camm,

As I understand the issue the original comparison was flawed.
(Renaud, please correct me if I'm wrong).

There were two versions of the code, one with debugging enabled
and one without. The GCL/Axiom was run with debugging, the NAG
version without.

I performed the same tests using the same source code and the
results are comparable. There was just a minor misunderstanding
about comparing debugging vs non-debugging code. This was cleared
up later.

Tim

Tim,

On Thursday Renaud refers to a bug and to "a new version" of
the code that he sent to you. Is that new version in the Axiom
CVS?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill,

The new version was in the CVS (new relative to the original NAG code).
However, the CVS did not contain Renaud's latest performance patch.

I've fixed this and am now doing "round trip" testing.
The CVS is updated with the performance patch.

Tim

Any ideas? I am clueless with Lisp.

Mark,

I'm building the system on gcl-2.6.3 as we speak.

Your version of the build appears to have failed in loading 
obj/linux/bin/makedep.lisp. This is a dynamically created file
which is used to build a new depsys image. The command it is
interpreting looks to be:

(build-depsys 
 (quote 
  ( "/boot/axiom/int/interp/vmlisp.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/ggreater.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/hash.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/bootfuns.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/union.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/nlib.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/macros.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/comp.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/spaderror.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/debug.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/spad.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/bits.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/setq.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/property.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/unlisp.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/foam_l.lisp"  
    "/boot/axiom/int/interp/axext_l.lisp")) 
  "/boot/axiom/mnt/linux" 
  "/boot/axiom/lsp/gcl-2.6.3" 
  "/boot/axiom/src" 
  "/boot/axiom/int" 
  "/boot/axiom/obj" 
  "/boot/axiom/mnt" 
  "linux")

The make-depsys function lives in src/interp/util.lisp.pamphlet

I'll see if it fails here before debugging it further.

Tim

Greetings!  Mark, are you still using the axiom build patches to use
external gcl?  If so, they need updating.  In particular,
gcl_collectfn needs to be in the image at an earlier point, which is
the cause of your failure below.

Here is what I'm testing at the moment:

Camm, Mark,

Perhaps we should make a separate system build name such as
 'external'
to handle these builds.

The design of the axiom makefile build tree is that each system,
such as linux, which requires changes in the makefiles to build
has its own build name. Thus, to build on a solaris system one
sets the AXIOM variable:

  (path)/axiom/mnt/solaris

which causes the top level Makefile to dynamically generate

  Makefile.solaris

These changes for an external lisp should properly be added to
the top level Makefile.pamphlet, a new build name such as 'external'
should be defined. Then the AXIOM variable would be set to:

  (path)/axiom/mnt/external

which causes the top level Makefile to dynamically generate

  Makefile.external

to handle all of the changes. I'll look at your patches and
see if I can incorporate them into the main branch rather than
apply them as patches.

Tim

Mark,

My system build has progressed past the make-depsys and is now
successfully compiling the algebra. So whatever the issue you
are have found is, it isn't present here.

Are you building with GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.2a?

Tim

No. I'm building with GCLVERSION=gcl-system and the patches that I sent
you last November and a week or two ago.

The "internal" GCL build is completely non-usable for us FreeBSD
folks, sorry!

Tim,

When you get a chance I would really appreciate your opinions
about my first attempts to draw and navigate through Axiom's
algebra lattice (actually, directed graph) using TouchGraph as
part of MathAction, the Axiom Wiki. It is sort of like the old
Axiom hyperdoc (only better, I think :) 

The graph is built automatically by the interface to TouchGraph
based on the Axiom Algebra Database. I hope to get some help
from other people to complete this Project to convert the
algebra pamphlet and spad files to AxiomWiki page format. The
conversion is not difficult but there are a lot of files, so
it is quite time consuming - as you so very well know Tim!

Anyway, so far I have only about 15 of the major Axiom
categories and a few domain. But already you can get a good
idea of how this might work.

Please take a look here:

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/withNavigator

This will start the Axiom wiki with a graphical "navigator" in
the top panel. Later you will probably want to increase the size
of the panel containing the graph. You can do this by positioning
the cursor just under the top horizontal slider bar until you
see the cursor change to a up-down arrow. Hold the left mouse
button down and drag the border down to make the top panel bigger.

Double-clicking on a node of the graph in the upper panel will
cause the contents of the lower panel to change. You can also use
a "right-click" on the node to hide, expand, re-center etc. the
node. You can click-and-hold a node to drag it to another part
of the panel. The graph will respond like a network of springs
with the edges stretching and then relaxing into a new shape.
Clicking and holding somewhere else on the upper panel other
than a node will "drag" the whole graph up-down or left right
so that you can pan into a new area. The slider bar at the
bottom of the top panel changes the scale. It takes a little
practice to play with this, but it is rather fun!

Now do a search for say, 'semigroup' by typing that word in the
box at the to right of the lower panel. Pressing Enter will
perform a search for any pages contain the word. Click on the
link labelled 'SemiGroup' under the heading Page Names.

Notice how the graph in the top panel changes - re-centering
on the page that you selected. One of the prominent features
you will notice right away is the Integer node with what seems
like a "pin-cushion" of links surrounding it. Since this is
detail we don't need right now, use a "right-click" on the
Integer node to hide it. Now you will see a reasonable sized
graph centred on the 'SemiGroup' category.  The graph displays
the relationships between the other categorys, domains and
packages "near" SemiGroup.

The links between the nodes are build automatically by parsing
the autoloading messages generated by the Axiom compiler. Some
of the nodes will also be "documentation" nodes as well as the
library code nodes themselves. Documentation nodes can make
reference to different parts of the graph and serve as a
further add to navigating the structure.

Axiom commands that are run using the option

  )set message autoload on

will also generate hyperlink references to the packages,
domains and categorys required by the code. I have also set
up the other parts of the web site

  http://page.axiom-developer.org

so these hyperlink references point back to the nodes in
the Axiom algebra database in the MathAction wiki.

   etc. etc. ...

I've probably already spent too much time having fun playing
with this, so I am interested to hear what other people think.
Will this be a useful tool to help manage the complexity of
Axiom's algebraic structures?

So everyone, please give it a try and give me some feedback...

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bob,

I think I now understand how the darcs repository works, so
I have set up two repositories for the AxiomWiki project
that you can get to from here:

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository.html

One contains the patches to LatexWiki to include Axiom,
the other contains minor patches to Zwiki.

Please let me know if you can access these or if I have done
something wrong in using darcs.

I am starting to like darcs, so if everything is ok, with
Tim Daly's approval I might setup a repository here also
for Axiom itself. Ideally, I would like to link this Axiom
repository to changes that might be made to Axiom library
code online from the Axiom Wiki.

Thanks.

Bill Page.

Bill,

It's easier to apologize than to get permission :-)
You have blanket permission to set up what you need.
I trust you to act reasonably.
Try to keep me informed :-)

Awesome!  I will be travelling to conferences for the next month, so I'm
not sure I will have time to work on this again until the end of August.
:(

You should let the zwiki folks know of your repository, so they can pull
your patches into the next release.  They are very regular with monthly
releases.

Axiom can sometimes generate output that is wider than a usual printed
page, generating LatexWiki images that are black on the part that is
wider than the page.  See:

    http://test.axiom-developer.org/Members/mcelrath/Kxaxiomtest

For an example.  This can be partially worked around by adding the
-g10000x10000 option to ghostscript, where 10000 is the resolution in
pixels of the output png.  However this makes for larger temporary
files, longer ghostscript running, and longer PIL processing to chop the
image down to size.

I have been wrestling with getting ghostscript to be more efficent about
this for some time.  It would be ideal if I could get it to generate
png's sized according to the bounding box, but it will not.  If you have
any ideas...

Axiom should also be chopping up its output so that it is not wider than
a page.

A C program written by Robert Sutor exists to do that.
I have a version of the TeXmacs interface for Axiom that
includes this program but the developer of TeXmacs said
that he preferred to enhance TeXmacs native ability to
split long LaTeX lines, so it is not currently included
in the TeXmacs distribution.

Anyway, I am planning to include this in the LatexWiki
Axiom interface ... just as soon as I have a enough time
to work out the details of calling a C subroutine from
Python. I know it is quite easily done, but do you happen
to know where I can find a simple example?

Regards,
Bill Page.

pydoc os

or use the existing 'runCommand' that I wrote.  (there are enhancements
to this function in my darcs, BTW)  Unless the algorithm is terribly
complicated, it might be worthwhile to just port the algorithm to
native python.  Python excels at string-processing anyway.

The correct method to modify the lisp kernel would be to use UFFI
(the universal foreign function interface). This should allow you
to use C code.

The question, however, is why. With proper type optimization it
is possible to generate lisp that is nearly optimal. I've seen
CAR, CDR, and the various mathematical operations like + reduced
to a single generated machine instruction. Except for truly 
data-intensive numeric operations, like matrix multiply, there
is not much gain. The huge gains in time come from better high
level algorithms. You don't have to perform a 1000x1000 matrix
multiply if you can prove the result must be zero before you start.

Hi,

I'm using the Axiom package for Debian, version 0.20040128-4. I try to 
compile my own package (in a spad file) using
   )comp mypackage

It seems to compile the LISP code, but then the C compiler complains:

End of Pass 1.
End of Pass 2.
code.c:2:24: cmpinclude.h: No such file or directory
In file included from code.c:3:
code.h:3: error: parse error before "LI1"
code.h:9: error: parse error before "LI3"
code.h:32: error: parse error before "LnkTLI7"
...(lots of errors follow)

Is cmpinclude.h missing or am I doing something wrong?

Marcus

Subject: Quantian
--text follows this line--
Dirk, Bill,

I want to introduce you two. 

Dirk Eddelbuettel is responsible for Quantian, a Knoppix-live CD
distribution of mathematical software. He maintains the distribution
at: http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html

Quantian is a very sweet idea. Basically a lot of mathematical
software is collected on one linux distribution. I'd like this
distribution to eventually get distributed as the "standard" 
computational mathematics platform. 

Bill Page is responsible for the wiki pages (originally Axiom, now
expanding to REDUCE and possibly others) which is another sweet idea.
It allows online creation of mathematics. The wiki may eventually get
split out as a standalone front end that can be packaged with Axiom or
other systems.

I think there is the possibility of a couple different events that
could quickly come together with little effort.

First to have a merger that puts Bill's work on Quantian. This would
bring the wiki front end to other systems.

Second to promote Quantian as a platform for doing computational
mathematics. Dirk has already collected a fair number of systems onto
one CD. If we can coordinate efforts we could arrange to have Quantian
CDs distributed at all of the math-related conferences.

Third to coordinate the next ISSAC conference to have at least poster
sessions demonstrating the use of the Page+Quantian effort. This would
involve actively creating some demonstrations using various systems.

Thoughts?

Tim

Subject: Quantian
--text follows this line--
Dirk, Bill,

I want to introduce you two. 

Dirk Eddelbuettel is responsible for Quantian, a Knoppix-live CD
distribution of mathematical software. He maintains the distribution
at: http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian.html

Quantian is a very sweet idea. Basically a lot of mathematical
software is collected on one linux distribution. I'd like this
distribution to eventually get distributed as the "standard" 
computational mathematics platform. 

Bill Page is responsible for the wiki pages (originally Axiom, now
expanding to REDUCE and possibly others) which is another sweet idea.
It allows online creation of mathematics. The wiki may eventually get
split out as a standalone front end that can be packaged with Axiom or
other systems.

I think there is the possibility of a couple different events that
could quickly come together with little effort.

First to have a merger that puts Bill's work on Quantian. This would
bring the wiki front end to other systems.

Second to promote Quantian as a platform for doing computational
mathematics. Dirk has already collected a fair number of systems onto
one CD. If we can coordinate efforts we could arrange to have Quantian
CDs distributed at all of the math-related conferences.

Third to coordinate the next ISSAC conference to have at least poster
sessions demonstrating the use of the Page+Quantian effort. This would
involve actively creating some demonstrations using various systems.

Thoughts?

Tim

Hi Tim,

Excellent to get email from you -- I had been meaning to send you one to see
where your efforts with respect to Quantian for ISSAC went...

These days it is actually a dvd as 700mb was too small, even at approx 3:1
compression.  With the dvd size, we can pack much more documentation -- I am
planning to eventually put almost all (that is easily available, which means
Debian doc packages for the binary packages) in there.

The most recent release came in at 1.2gb. I have a few HOWTOs on the site
showing how to boot that even if you don't have a dvd drive, let alone a
writer. Also, within days of "going dvd" I had heard from two dvd vendors
that Quantian dvds available for just a few dollars.

Yes, though Quantian tries to stay somewhat agnostic of disciplines. Hence,
my focus is not primarily math -- it just so happens that a large number of
CAS systems were already available as good Debian packages, so I included
them. Personally, I work more on the empirical front.

That said, we have a lot of "quantiative" or "numerical" or "scientific"
software in here which make Quantian appealing to different "disciplines" --
I really welcome input like this and will try to accomate specific requests
where I can as this tends to improve things for others as a side effect. An
almost free lunch, if you wish.

I will also CC Ed Pegg, who is into math (as editor of Math Games at the
MAA), and who has been a supporter of Quantian for a while -- and has
contributed a very nice background image too. So everybody, meet Ed. He may
have some thoughts on making Quantian a base for math endeavours.

The best way for this would be decent Debian packages. It doesn't have to be
in the main Debian archive, though that is preferable. I do take for example
Scientific Python packages from a contributor site as .deb packages, and it
is the same with the giac/xcas CAS by B. Parisse.

That would be sweet. The cd/dvd printer may help and give volume discounts.

I'd be up for that too, though my Ph.D. is in math econ. I better say that
now as I don't want to get you guys thrown out of your conferences if you
work with an Economist :)

Sounds good, let's keep it rolling.

My initial desire is a page or something that will allow a new user to
do something neat with each program.

The Axiom WIKI (what is the URL?) would be nice for that, since
experts in a particular area could add things to it.  For example --
Python ... here's a quick program ... here's how to run it ... here's
links to Python material.

Perhaps later, http://planetmath.org/ and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics  can have individual math
entries updated with short programs, with links to the appropriate
languages and Quantian  (which will be the program with everything).

Incidently, I can turn over quantian.org (currently a redirect) to
anyone, if that would be a good spot for a WIKI.  I have hosting
arranged at Eskimo.com

Yes, I think it would be great to have "active" mathematics based on
Axiom in planetmath and wikipedia.

I am willing to build a mirror site based on page.axiom-developer.org
at another location. Currently it runs on a RedHat 9 system. I need
to install Zope, Zwiki, LatexWiki + my extensions, Plone, Axiom etc.
And currently I use Apache to front for Zope (optional).

I could pull in some Zope/Plone expertise from the folks currently hosting
Quantian at UW, but am pretty clueless with that system myself.

That said, we can try on one of my Debian boxen at home. Could you work on
that via ssh?  I would have to keep root access to myself, but Debian should
have most of what we need (but maybe not latexwiki).  See below for a quick
apt-cache search.

Everyone:

I have a very preliminary implementation of an interface
to REDUCE implemented on the test.axom-developer.org site.
Please see:

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/Members/billpage/TestReduce

for some initial examples.

I would appreciate the help of those Axiom developers who
know REDUCE (or want to learn) to test this. Let me know
what goes wrong, what is missing and especially any hints
and tips about security issues.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill,

Attached is the Rosetta document which details some of the differences
between Axiom and other system's syntax. In particular, it lists REDUCE.

\chapter{Rosetta Translations}

\section{Introduction}

The following is a collection of synonyms for various operations in
the computer algebra systems \Axiom, \Derive, \GAP, \Gmp, \DoCon,
\Macsyma, \Magnus, \Maxima, \Maple, \Mathematica, \MuPAD, \Octave,
\Pari, \Reduce, \Scilab, \Sumit\ and \Yacas.  This collection does not
attempt to be comprehensive, but hopefully it will be useful in giving
an indication of how to translate between the syntaxes used by the
different systems in many common situations.  Note that a blank entry
means either (a) that there may be an exact translation of a
particular operation for the indicated system, but we don't know what
it is or (b) there is no exact translation but it may still be
possible to work around this lack with a related functionality.

While commercial systems are not provided on this CD the intent of the
Rosetta effort is to make it possible for experienced Computer Algebra
users to experiment with other systems. Thus the commands for
commercial systems are included to allow users of those systems to
translate.

Some of these systems are special purpose and do not support a lot of
the functionality of the more general purpose systems. Where they do
support an interpreter the commands are provided.

Neat!

I wonder if your last example on that page is correct...neither Maple
nor Mathematica will do that integral.

I was thinking to separate your code into a different PageType.  i.e.
the PageType specifies what this document is *written* in.  Separate
=66rom that is the presentation (i.e. png/mathml which should not be a
page type -- as I have it now).  Is the new Reduce stuff in your darcs
repository?

But now we have two math backends...and it might be very useful to have
both in the same document.  So should we define a
StructuredText+LaTeX+Math pagetype where 'Math' refers to any symbolic
backend?  It would also be useful to do a bit of stylesheet magic to
differentiate between Axiom/Reduce/Maxima...  Perhaps some small text in
the UR corner that says what language this is.

Bob,

The Trager/Bronstein Integration can be broken up into a set of cases.
This is one special case that was not implemented but should be integrable.

One use I expect to have for these pages is test cases. I'm working
on CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite). The basic idea is to document
some mathematics and then implement the computation in a variety of
systems. The idea is to pool the tedious effort of developing a test
suite so that all the systems can benefit from the effort.

NIST funded a project years ago to do a classification of the various
types of numerical mathematics. There is no corresponding classification
scheme for symbolic mathematics. CATS could form the basis for a scheme
for classification of the mathematics and provide test cases for each
category.

Bill's idea of joining several systems in one page is an important tool
for this kind of work.

Tim,

I have added your Rosetta document to the Axiom portal test
site at

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/wiki/RosettaStone

After you take a look at it and if you think it would be
useable in this form, then we can make whatever editting
you think necessary and then move it to the main site. For
one thing, probably we should split this document into
several web pages.

I converted this using the LaTeX to HTML converted called
HEVEA. See

  http://para.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/

Inspite of this be a rather complex document, I think that
HEVEA did a quite good job of the conversion AND it was FAST.

Bob, perhaps this is the kind of LaTeX to HTML converter
that we could use in LatexWiki?! The licensing conditions
seem about right. :)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill,

It looks like it translated quite well.
The only two comments are that the wiki wants to insert ? after [] exprs
and the latex form of groebner (gr\"obner) didn't seem to translate well.

I have avoided this math-using-HTML-only technique (latex2html does this
too) because I think it looks like crap.  Also it appears that hevea
requires the user to do some browser configuration (also something I
would like to avoid).  I think math should be either an image or MathML.

It would be nice, however, to have the math-using-HTML option and let
users decide what they want to see.

It happens with any code really, such as one of the spad files from 
src/algebra, or this test file:

----------------------------------------------------
)abbrev package TESTPAK TestPackage
TestPackage(): Exports == Implementation where
   Exports == with
     op: INT -> INT

   Implementation == add

do you have m4 installed? (see the FAQ file in the latest distribution).
I believe this problem occurs because m4 is missing.
Look at the early messages and see if there is an error message
complaining about m4.

Hi Xin,

This is the Steve you know from the lab! I have only posted here once
before, so I'd like to introduce myself to the rest of the list.

Im an undergrad at UWO studying math and comp-sci. I have a strong
interest in computer algebra, both theory and implementation. I am
currently working as a research assistant at ORCCA (Ontario Research
Center for Computer Algebra) implementing univariate and multivariate
polynomial factorization routines (via Hensel lifting, van Hoeij
recombination) in Aldor under the supervision of Marc Moreno
Maza. Tim, we met briefly when you last visited UWO. 

I have lurked on this list for some months now. I only jump in when my
insane inexperience isn't so obvious :) 

Xin, You need to edit lsp/Makefile.pamphlet line 300 (as of cvs 2-3
days ago). It reads as:

 ./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-statsysbfd --enable-maxpage=128*1024 ;

you should change this to:

 ./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd \
 --enable-maxpage=128*1024 ;

I built AXIOM on this very same machine a month or so ago, and this
fix worked for me. Thus, I dont think the problem is M4. I also had
this problem (with the same fix) for Slackware 9.1.

Hope this helps,
Steve

Tim,

Sending you this simple comment has been on my TODO list for some
time.

Regarding src/clef/edible.c.pamphlet, line 291, we have:

   struct termio ptermio;

This should be:

   struct termios ptermio;

Now if you unwind the #ifdef's you see that this is not compiled
unless 'unlikely' is defined (top of file, lines 79-83). Perhaps this
is truly dead code, but maybe this fix will save someone a few minutes
and a redundant `make' down the road.

Cheers,
Steve

Which GCL is currently being used in Axiom?  Until recently I had to do
the same thing with GCL on Gentoo Linux, but I'm not sure if it was
system upgrades or a GCL upgrade which eliminated the need.

Hi Tim,

Most of my understanding of this issue has been derived from reading
this list. GCL carries its own version of the BDF (Binary File
Descriptor) library which is a part of binutils. For gcl-2.6.3 as
packaged with Axiom, in gcl/binutils/bfd/README, there is a short
description:

   BFD is an object file library.  It permits applications to use the
   same routines to process object files regardless of their format.

   BFD is used by the GNU debugger, assembler, linker, and the binary
   utilities.

   The documentation on using BFD is scanty and may be occasionally
   incorrect.  Pointers to documentation problems, or an entirely
   rewritten manual, would be appreciated.

   There is some BFD internals documentation in doc/bfdint.texi which may
   help programmers who want to modify BFD.

   BFD is normally built as part of another package.  See the build
   instructions for that package, probably in a README file in the
   appropriate directory.


Now again, for gcl-2.6.3, ./configure --help yields:

 --enable-statsysbfd \
     uses a static sytem bfd library for loading and relocationing \
     object files.

 --enable-locbfd \
      uses a static bfd library built from this source tree for \
      loading and relocationing object files. 

So, my suggestion of --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd seems to
imply "don't use the system bfd library, use the gcl based library
instead". 

I have next to zero understanding as to how gcl works internally. I do
not know under what system conditions the build fails w.r.t bfd. I
have built Axiom under Mandrake 10 and Slackware 9.1, and in both cases
I have had this same problem. I will try to build under Redhat 9, and
if the build succeeds, then perhaps I can start looking at the system
differences and get some idea as to what causes the failure. If there
are any suggestions as how one might better understand this problem, I
am more than willing to help in what ever way I can.

Thanks,
Steve

I don't know. My only concern was the claim made often for Axiom
hat due to the nature of the algorithm for integration "it will
either give an answer or a demonstration that no answer exists".
In this rather simple case it failed. But as Tim said, this is
probably due to Axiom not (yet) handling a specific case. I
wonder if there are other missing cases and if so, I wonder if
there is anyone around with enough knowledge of the algorithm
to fill in these gaps?

I agree but I do not yet have the skills to do this.

Yes. It is here

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/LatexWiki

The patch is named "Reduce interface".

That makes sense to me. Whether specific programs such as
Axiom or Reduce are supported could be determined dynamically
based on whether the appropriate environment is installed.
If it is not installed, then a reference to a specific system
will just look like another user-defined LaTeX environment.
Perhaps I can define some default LaTeX coding in LatexTemplate
that would make these environments display appropriately even
when the necessary program is not available.

I think that is a good idea. You can see an example of this
in the newest version of the code at

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/Members/billpage/TestReduce

Note also my comments there about using the Reduce tri package
(TeX) package rather than the rlfi package (LaTeX). The first
version used rlfi but I ran into a problem. And tri does seem
to have some advantages in terms of line breaking etc.
