Subject: [recurrence relation operator] (nouveau) 

Here is a simple implemention of a recurrence relation operator. It is far 
from finished, but might serve as a starting point. I experienced the following 
difficulties:

 - The operator model in Axiom is quite restrictive: all arguments have to be 
   from the same domain. This leads to problems elsewhere, too. I don't think 
   that the following can be justified mathematically:

\begin{axiom}
sum(k,k=1.0..2.5)
\end{axiom}

  - dummy variables are only supported in a very limited fashion: for the 
    recurrence relation operator it would be good to have also "dummy operators"...

Things to 
do:

  - a proper operation analogous to 'sum', 'rootOf' or the like needs to be written.
    The operation 'evalRec' is just for a start

  - evalRec needs to be speeded up

\begin{axiom}
)abbrev package RECOP RecurrenceOperator
RecurrenceOperator(R, F): Exports == Implementation where
  R: Join(OrderedSet, IntegralDomain, RetractableTo Integer)
  F: FunctionSpace R

  Exports == with

    evalRec: (BasicOperator, Symbol, F, F, F, List F) -> F

  Implementation == add

    ddrec: List F -> OutputForm
    ddrec l ==
      k := kernels(l.4)
      op := operator(k.1)::OutputForm
      values := reverse l

      vals: List OutputForm
           := cons(elt(op, [(l.3)::OutputForm]) = eval(l.1, l.2, l.3)::OutputForm,
                   [elt(op, [i::OutputForm]) = (values.i)::OutputForm
                    for i in 1..#values-4])

      bracket(hconcat([operator(k.1)(l.3)::OutputForm,
                       ": ",
                       commaSeparate vals]))


    oprecur := operator("rootOfRec"::Symbol)$BasicOperator

    setProperty(oprecur, "%specialDisp", 
                ddrec@(List F -> OutputForm) pretend None)

    setProperty(oprecur, "%dummyVar", 2 pretend None)

-- this implies that the second and third arguments of oprecur are dummy
-- variables and affects tower$ES:
-- the second argument will not appear in tower$ES, if it does not appear in
-- any argument but the first and second.
-- the third argument will not appear in tower$ES, if it does not appear in any
-- other argument. (%defsum is a good example)

-- The arguments of rootOfRec are as follows:
-- 1. next, i.e., f(dummy+1)
-- 2. dummy
-- 3. variable, i.e., for display              
-- 4. operatorname(argument)
-- 5.- values in reversed order
-- maybe "values" should be preceded by the index of the first given
-- value. Currently, the last value is interpreted as f(1)

    evalRec (op, argsym, argdisp, arg, next, values) ==
      if ((n := retractIfCan(arg)@Union(Integer, "failed")) case "failed")
         or (n < 1)
      then
        kernel(oprecur, 
               append([next, argsym::F, argdisp, op(arg)], values))
      else 
        len := #values
        if n <= len
        then values.(len-n+1)
        else
          nextval := eval(next, argsym::F, (len+1)::F)
          newval := eval(nextval, op, 
                         evalRec(op, argsym, argdisp, #1, next, values))
          evalRec(op, argsym, argdisp, arg, next, cons(newval, values))

    irecur: List F -> F
-- This is just a wrapper that allows us to write a recurrence relation as an
-- operator.
    irecur l ==
      k := kernels(l.4)
      evalRec(operator(k.1),
              retract(l.2)@Symbol, l.3,
              argument(k.1).1, l.1, rest(l, 4))

    evaluate(oprecur, irecur)$BasicOperatorFunctions1(F)
\end{axiom}

Here is an example:

\begin{axiom}
argsym := new()$Symbol;
argexp := argsym::Expression Integer;
op := operator new()$Symbol;
ne := elt(op, argexp - 1) + elt(op, argexp - 2::Expression Integer);
r:=evalRec(op, argsym, a::Expression Integer, a::Expression Integer, ne, [1,1])
         $RecurrenceOperator(Integer, Expression Integer)
eval(r, a=7)
\end{axiom}

Subject: [#138 asin(complex(1.0,0.0))] 

This and the log(i)-log(-i) bug can be fixed by using GCL's asin and log here.  I tried 

     if $ has Field and $ has sqrt: $ -> $ then
--       asin x == atan(x/sqrt(1-x**2))
       asin x == ASIN(COMPLEX(real x,imag x)$Lisp)$Lisp

but the form of x when complex in axiom is not that of lisp, i.e. asin gets passed a non-number:

   >> System error:
   ((1 . 0) 0 . 0) is not of type NUMBER.


In general, I think it a good idea to avoid having to duplicate the functionality of the standard lisp functions in axiom, but there may be some philosophical reason for doing this due to the domain structures or some such.  If one needs the correct logic for a duplicate implementation, one can look at the gcl_numlib.lsp file in the lsp/ subdirectory.

OK, then what we want is something like:

       asin x == - %i * log( %i * x + sqrt(1 - x*x))

but this does not appear to be used when put into trigcat.spad.pamphlet and recompiling.  Perhaps someone could explain?

Secondly, perhaps ist is of use to bring forward GMP/mpfr optimized multi-precision floating point in GCL for use by axiom here?

I understand the multi-precision argument, but is there a difference between a 'generic imlementation' and the lisp one where the category of the domain coincides precisely with the lisp type?

Lastly, do we have to use this difficult interface as opposed to the developer email list?

I believe furthermore, that the problem with 'argument' as described in bug #47 will persist if we fix it this way.

I think that a lot of care has to be taken if we use Lisp functions instead of "homegrown" ones.

Concerning the place of discussion: I too think that it would be better to:

  - ask on axiom-developer whether it is really an issue, if this is not clear
  - signal the issue on IssueTracker
  - discuss it on axiom-developer
  - add proposed fixes on IssueTracker.

Since any change on IssueTracker will notify axiom-developer, there is no danger of missing anything.

I think that the following definition would 
work::

       asin x == if x = 1 then pi()/2::$ else atan(x/sqrt(1-x**2))

There is one thing that puzzles me, though. Also in 'TRANFUN', the following definition is given for 'pi()'::

       pi()   == 2*asin(1)

which seems to be asking for trouble. However, I couldn't find a domain that would use this definition for 'pi()'. Maybe it should be rather defined in terms of 'atan'?

Tim,

The links like

are intended to lead to a page on MathAction called Mirror.
That page contains a solicitation to people who download
something to contribute something in return and then let
them pass with one more click to complete the download.
When I implemented this last week it seemed to be working
fine for me using both the FireFox and Microsoft explorer
browsers on Windows and FireFox on linux.

I have no idea what "bigMirrors.com" is but this may be
happening because of a limitation of the browser that you
are using. What browser are you using??

A link like "http:Mirror" is supposed to be relative to the
page on which it is located, so it should be interpreted as
a page on the same server, ie. MathAction. But I do vaguely
recall that some old browser versions did not do this
correctly.

I have reverted the links to refer to the MathAction Mirror
page again, but this time I wrote out the full absolute url
so it should work no matter what  version of browser you
are using.

Let me know if this still is not working for you.

BTW: Thanks for your work on the April release!

The hyperdoc and )show commands associate the source file of a package with

even close to the correct file name. Please note that one spad file may contain
many domains and packages. So most clicks in hyperdoc on the source file results

Subject: Axiom does not configure/build on OpenBSD

Hello ---

 Axiom fail to configure and build on OpenBSD.
 AFAIK, OpenBSD would have all the requirements, with the exception of
GCL, which is a Lisp build from C code (so it should be no problem
/and/ its included in Axiom anyways): gcc, GNUMake, etc. It's even
possible to have Linux emulation (with RedHat 8.0 binaries, as of now,
or FreeBSD 4.0 library emulation).
 I'm not yet a good Unix, just a newbie, but from what I've seen, you
make too much assumptions about a Linux system, instead of just
assuming Unix (a bigger set, include Linux).
 Why does the configure script, for instance, bork with a Unix that's
not one of those included? I don't see anything in the Makefile that
implies that using system() is a necessary condition. I might be
wrong, though :-)
 I would like to help having Axiom on yet-another-open-source-unix, a
BSD at least. I like OpenBSD. It's a very secure system, very well
programmed (fewer mistakes in C than average) and it's growing in
packages and ports of applications. What can I do to help?

Subject: Re: hyperdoc source links are often wrong

William and Tim,

The problem to which William is referring is caused by
the way Tim has re-organized the original *.spad source
files into *.spad.pamphlet files. The mapping is many-to-
one where there used to be 1000+ *.spad files there are
now only 300+ *.spad.pamphlet files. The new OpenSource
makefile extracts the individual *.spad files as intermediate
files as needed by the rest of the build, but these are not
the ones passed on to the 'mnt' release directory. Instead
the current makefile extracts the merged *.spad.pamphlet
files and calls them *.spad files in the 'mnt' directory,
but these correspond to the 300+ *.spad.pamphlet files
not the 1000+ original *.spad files. I agree that the fact
that these appear with the suffix ".spad" is confusing because
the names because these are not the original *.spad
files.

I think one reason that Tim may have done that was to keep
these source files in sync with the corresponding *.dvi
documentation files - that is a good thing. But unfortunately
it breaks Axiom's original method of referring to the
appropriate source.

Perhaps the *.spad files extracted as intermediate files
could just be copied into the 'mnt' directory instead of
the re-packaged versions. That would at least make Axim
work the way it used to. But in the new system of
code+documentation in pamphlet files really one is not
supposed to be editing the *.spad files directly, rather it
is the pamphlet file that is should to be changed - both
code and associated documentation.

So I suppose really Axiom should be supplying the new
*.spad.pamphlet file names. This might be a little difficult
since currently Axiom itself does not understand the
mapping of spad to pamphlet files. I think that something
would have to be changed in the Axiom database files.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Subject: Re: hyperdoc source links are often wrong

Dear Bill:

Thanks for your comments. 

Perhaps it's a good idea to associate each constructor with its own
spad file, but I am not convinced. Historically, I believe that is not
the case. Many authors write one large spad file containing multiple
constructors (related, of course) -- one reason may be to save
duplication of macros. It is also easier to follow a constructor if
related ones are nearby. When extracting spad files for individual
constructors, care should be taken to include all global macros in the
file.

The old (NAG) hyperdoc is able to jump to the constructor even though
there may be several in the same file, much like the local html
name=xx and #xx references. This feature is no longer available in the
new hyperdoc (at least until the files are broken up, which kind of
defeats the purpose of Tim's reorganization). So perhaps a solution
would be that the hyperdoc links are not file names, but are global
name tags, by which the location of a constructor (file and tag) can
be obtained from a database or table.

Yes, I'm aware of the problem and its cause. I've added Issue #144 to

The problem is that previously the compiler compiled all of the files

Now the compiler is invoked on the individual domains in the file.

Well, there is no such thing as a simple job. It only takes one simple
difference to stop the build which consists of thousands of steps. Even
a 1 character difference in a file (SIGCHLD vs SIGCLD) causes the build
to fail.

Since I don't have a BSD system I can use I'm working blind and
depend on others for fixes.

The configure script is written to figure out options on systems where
Axiom can run. It is a hard problem to write system-dependent code (such
as figuring out the system name, version, and release) on a system that
Axiom has never seen.

There are 3 people who have expressed an interest in *BSD systems:
Chuck Miller Charles Miller  (BSD on the MAC OSX)
Pierre Doucy (BSD on the MAC OSX)
Mark Murray  Mark Murray       (FreeBSD)

Visit http://arch.axiom-developer.org, follow the instructions under
"If you need write access to the archive" (toward the bottom of the page)
and become an active developer.

If you don't want to be a developer you can help by trying to build Axiom,
sending the failing console output to this list, and either suggesting
fixes or testing fixes I suggest. This effectvely makes you my remote
hand and eyes. It's a slow process and requires a lot of patience but it
is still an effective way to work. 

You can also be very effective by posting good bug reports on IssueTracker
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/IssueTracker

Mark Murray has sent me a whole set of changes for FreeBSD, most of which
I have merged into the version of the system planned for the May target.
The hope is to get the system able to build on FreeBSD by then.

In many cases it is not possible to split the individual spad files into
a one-[domain|package|category]-per-file, at least not with the current

This is not a hard problem to fix but it just takes time.

Time has been severely limited because I no longer work on Axiom in work.
Since February Axiom has been a strictly off-hours effort. This impacted
the March release (there was none) but I've gotten my development work

Yes, this needs to be done but has not yet been done.
There are other breakages that have to be fixed. For instance,
)compile should accept a pamphlet file and properly update the
documentation as well as compile the file.

Look at http://daly.axiom-developer.org/doyen

The Doyen idea is very simple. When you present your paper at a science
conference you give out a URL. Everyone in the audience has a Doyen "Live CD"
that was given out with the conference materials. If they boot the "Live CD"
(it doesn't touch their hard drive so it won't affect their machines)
then they can "drag and drop" your literate paper (which includes the
source code) onto their machine and run your results while you give
your talk.

The means that everyone in the audience has your program as well as
your paper and can reproduce your results. Isn't that the definition
of a science? And it works for every branch of science that uses a
computer.

The Doyen project is actually a generalization of the ideas for Axiom.
It addresses the problem that we, as computational mathematicians, are
not making our fundamental results (programs) available in sharable and
archivable form. I've seen hundreds of presentations where reference is
made to the software that supports results but I can't get or use the 
software.

It also means that everyone in the audience is reproducing any errors.

Isn't the essence of reproducing an experiment to start with the theory 
and construct the experiment yourself, rather that pushing the "GO" 
button in the original scientist's laboratory?

I partially agree with this, but access to the original software should 
only really be for checking purposes.

Of course, certain classes of research need to be less stringent on 
this; theoretical compiler design would be an example.

>Perhaps it's a good idea to associate each constructor with it own
 spad file,but I am not convinced. Historically, I believe that is not
 the case. Many authors write one large spad file containing multiple
 constructors (related, of course) -- one reason may be to save
 duplication of macros. It is also easier to follow a constructor if
 related ones are nearby.

I agree. In fact Tim's reorganization from 1000+ *.spad files (some of
which already included multiple constructors) into the 300+
*.spad.pamphlet files effectively combines even more constructors into a
smaller number of (hopefully) logically related groups. I think that for
the most part the original groupings of constructors into spad files is
retained in the <<chunk>> structure of the pamphlet files. But perhaps
in some cases Tim may have also broken some original spad files into
multiple chunks. (Is that right Tim?) In any case, the way the current
build works is that there is a spad file internally created by running
'tangle' for each spad <<chunk>> for the *.spad.pamphlet files. It is
these file names that end up in Axiom's database and show up in hypertex
and in ')show constructor'.

I think it seems mentally and physically more feasible to document some
300 groups of related constructors rather than over a 1000! So mostly
this reorganization is a good thing.

>When extracting spad files for individual constructors, care should
 be taken to include all global macros in the file.

Yes, this is done in the current build process.

>The old (NAG) hyperdoc is able to jump to the constructor even though
 there may be several in the same file, much like the local html
 name=xx and #xx references. This feature is no longer available in
 the new hyperdoc (at least until the files are broken up, which kind
 of defeats the purpose of Tim's reorganization).

I think this happens when ')compile xxx.spad' is called. The file name
xxx.spad is associated in the database with each of the constructors in
the spad file. Unfortunately files with these names only exist
"internally" in the build (i.e. in the 'int' directory) and do not find
their way into the 'mnt' directory.

If the purpose was only to be able to view the spad source without the
associated documentation in the pamphlet file, then I think including
these files in a "read-only" manner in the distribution would probably
not compromise too much the original intention of the re-organization.
But perhaps the temptation to edit these files might prove irresistible :)

>So perhaps a solution would be that the hyperdoc links are not file names, but are global name tags, by which the location of a constructor (file and tag) can be obtained from a database or table.
>

Yes, I think this might be possible. As I said above, these hyperdoc
links are actually associated with the spad <<chunk>> names in the new
*.spad.pamphlet files. In principle it should not be too difficult to
use this information together with both 'tangle' and 'weave' to find the
associated code and documentation. Ideally one might want a text editor
that understands the structure of the pamphlet files and lets you create
both code and documentation in an integrated manner. But failling that,
perhaps we could develope some command line tools to interface with
'notangle' and 'noweave'. Tim already has something like this in the
'document' script.

Maybe hyperdoc can be extended to understand the structure of pamphlet
files so that at least in that context the appropriate code and
documentation could be displayed. (Tim, is that part of your current
re-design of hyperdoc?)

Tim,

You also have the Doyen page on MathAction

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/Doyen

should the contents of your new web page be merged with
this or do you want to keep them separate?

Sending commands to sman via a pipe does not work.

This method is currently used on MathAction and in the TexMacs
interface to send commands to AXIOMsys with no problems. In order
to get Axiom graphics running on MathAction and under TexMacs , we
will need to start sman instead of AXIOMsys in order to setup the
process handling for graphics. But when I try to pipe commands to
sman, even with the -noht -noclef options, sman just issues two
prompts and waits. It does not seem to try to read from stdin. If
I try to key in )quit and yes, etc. there is no reaction and I must
eventually kill the process(es).

Axiom 3.4 (April 2005), compiled and running under SuSE 9,2,

This is an intermittent fault, happening more than half the time. Occurs 
when logged in at console, also when logged in by ssh with X-forwarding 
(from SuSE 9.1), and from a Win PC by Hummingbird exceed. Nothing is 
logged in .xsession-errors.

Actions to reproduce fault:
1) Start axiom, as above.
2) In HyperDoc window, click on "Examples", then in next window on 
"Graphics", then on "Assorted Examples". Now click on the first down-arrow 
icon, following "Function of two variables: z=f(x,y)". (Also happens for 
other examples, of course.)

More than half the time, all windows vanish, except for the initial 
terminal window (in which one typed "axiom").

There are no error messages.

HOWEVER: If instead of clicking on the down-arrow, one clicks on the 
"draw" command next to it, the command executes in a new terminal window 
without problem. Clicking on the down-arrow subsequently displays the 
graph in-line, with no crash.

Also, typing that draw command into the original terminal window, one gets 
a plausible graph.

Have fun,
	Cheers, Mark.

In a shell (and in any browser too):

http://page.axiom-developer.org seems to be working fine for me this 
morning.
Perhaps it was an intermittant problem or maybe you have a local domain name
server configuration problem on your network?

Bill Page.

Subject: Possible GCL 2.6.7 for axiom

Hi Tim!  Great conference!

Here's my take home understanding of the remaining issues re:
gcl/axiom:

1) reenable run-process
2) display images in tcl/tk
3) tcl/tk working in windows
4) Windows socket workaround for sman/hypertex/graphics

These might go into a quick 2.6.7 GCL release.

5) axiom configure script

There are a few math bugs in addition for which I'd like to propose
fixes and test.  Should I make a tla branch?  If so, what should it be
called?

I attended both the pre-conference (sprint) day and the main
conference. The two days seemed to go by very quickly which
for me usually means that it was interesting, worthwhile, but
that there was too much to do in too little time. While it is
still fresh in my mind I will try to list below some of the
things that stood out for me and I hope other participants
will add their comments as well. 

I will let Tim report on the actual statistics, but I think
the conference was quite well attended, considering that it
was the first ever meeting about the new open source version
of Axiom. We had about 7 or 8 people the first day and somewhere
between 30-50 people the second day.

The City College campus was a great venue. The apple and cherry
blossoms highlighted the wonderfully maintained historical
buildings which seemed to me to blend well with those of more
modern architecture and the distant backdrop of New York city
skyscrapers ... (there that is the extent of my capacity for
poetic imagery :). Plus I would like to say thank you to
Gilbert Baumslag and Bernice Ravitz for their generous
hospitality.

The discussion on the sprint day was lead by Tim Daly and
revolved around future directions and the larger, longer term
context in which open source Axiom will develop. For those
people who have been following the discussion here on the
Axiom-developer list for the last two years, much of what we
discussed would have seemed familiar. We talked about many
things, but here as some that come immediately to mind:

- literate programming and documentation, pamphlet format
  files (noweb) and implementation on the web

- mathematical versus program correctness and relationship
  to proof systems like ACL2,

- user interfaces, both desktop and web-based; and their
  integration (the doyen project)

I am sure we can add other things to this list. It did seem to
me however that (as usual and normal in an open source project)
we did not really make any firm decisions. We have many more
ideas for projects and research than there are available
resources.

During the latter part of the day we spent some time on more
technical issues such as the role of GCL in support of platform
independent graphics (for both Linux/Unix and Windows). Tim
demonstrated a possible Java-based solution but I think the
idea of adding a Java dependency to Axiom motivated all of us
to think of ways that this could be achieved more directly with
GCL and tcl/tk.

I also helped set up a Windows development environment for
Axiom on one of the workstations in the open source development
lab. Tim and I worked (without a complete resolution) on a
problem of building the new Axiom book volumes from the tla
archives in the Windows environment. There seems to be an
issue with noweb even though it works properly for building
Axiom from source on Windows.

The main conference day was to be devoted to applications of
Axiom. Perhaps there was not enough discussion of actually
applications, however William Sit did give some examples of the
using Axiom "for both fun and research" and during part of my
talk (which was mainly about the MathAction website and how it
supports both Axiom development and Axiom users) I did point
out the work on "guessing integer sequences" that Martin Rubey
has posted on www.axiom-developer.org

Tim Daly opened the conference with an overview of Axiom and
the concept of the "30 Horizon": 30 years back from a historical
perspective and 30 years forward. He gave reasons why we might
believe that Axiom will still be actively used and developed
30 years from now and what we might be able to do now to help
ensure this.

Richard Fateman discussed the "state-of-the-art" in what one
might call the "artificial intelligence view" of computer algebra
systems, he pointed out that although current systems like Axiom,
Maxima and commercial systems like Mathematica and Maple are
useful for symbolic computation, they are still a long way from
being "artificial mathematicians". I think also that with his
analogy of a "mathematical golem", Richard might have also been
trying to suggest that the goal of creating artificial
mathematicians might not be such a good idea. :)

Camm Maquire gave a talk on the history and potential of open
source software. To me this was a bit of a surprise given Camm's
specific and detailed technical contributions to both GCL and
Axiom, but at a conference focused on **applications** I think
these are issues that need to be addressed. How can we convince
academic and commercial budget managers that open source can
compete effectively with commercial products when the economics
and motivations are so different?

In all of the talks there seemed to be a common thread of the
need for collaboration - between Axiom developers; among Axiom
users and between mathematicians and the Axiom system. I think
there was a general agreement that in the open source Axiom
project so far we have achieved some significant steps in the
right direction but that there remains a lot more to do.

Finally, I want to add a special personal thanks to Richard
Fateman for solving a last minute technical problem with
network access to the axiom-developer.org website by the
loan of his laptop computer and wireless Internet connection.
Without his help I don't think I could have given a particularly
convincing verbal demonstration of the potential for the
MathAction website to support the kinds of collaboration that
Axiom needs.

This is consistent with my recollection of our discussions
during the Axiom sprint session. And I am willing to help
with testing and debugging on the Windows platform.

But we should be clear I think, that this is not necessarily
the shortest path to a fully functioning version of Axiom on
Windows. The linux version of Axiom does not now use tcl/tk
for Graphics and Hypertex, i.e. those parts of Axiom that are
not already ported to Microsoft Windows. Instead these currently
depend directly on the X windows libraries. These should perhaps
be re-implemented in tcl/tk linux first before attempting the
port to Windows.

Because of this X windows dependency the shortest path,
though admittedly not necessarily the best path, for fully
implementing Axiom on Windows would probably be to use Cygwin.
Currently GCL on windows uses MinGW instead of Cygwin to
compile to native Windows but unlike Cygwin MinGW does not
provided an X windows compatible environment.

I think using native Windows applications on Windows is a
wothwhile target but it is sometimes hard for applications
that originate on linux/Unix.

In principle it is possible to continue to compile AXIOMsys
as a native Windows application and to run the Hypertex and
Graphics components of Axiom under Cygwin. This would make
it unnecessary to convert any already working code to tcl/tk.
As I understand it, these additional components of Axiom
currently only require a Unix-compatible C programming
environment. So all we would need for this alternative is
step 4) above - socket compatibility between the current
native Windows version of GCL and the additional C code
compiled under Cygwin.

Of course there are drawbacks. Using *both* MSYS/MinGW and
Cygwin under Windows would further complicate the Windows
build environment for Axiom. Currently there is no Cygwin
version of GCL. Further, the X windows user interface under
Cygwin might seem a little awkward for some Microsoft
Windows users. But it should still be possible to prepare an
auto-installation binary distribution that would make much
of this transparent for users who are not interested in
building Axiom from source.

>

However perhaps there are other reasons which would also
motivate the development of GCL tcl/tk on Microsoft Windows.

>

Yes! I think that would be a great step forward. I think
Axiom should conform more closely to the de facto norm
for building open source software.

I don't think a special tla branch would be necessary
unless you contemplate drastic changes to Axiom's algebra.
(I think there is already a tla branch for that purpose.
See http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/ArchUsage )

If you are just testing and proposing fixes you can do that
on a local copy of Axiom and then post them to IssueTracker
on www.axiom-developer.org This would allow other people to
test them and then they could be incorporated into the main
distribution.

I wasn't able to attend the conference :-(, and in discussing this
possibility I'm admittedly skating on vapor trails and assuming skills
I don't currently have, but if at some point in the future a QT4
backend was written for McCLIM and somebody (me for the sake of
discussion anyway) implimented a GUI CAS interface in it, would that be
of interest to Axiom?  QT4 will be available as GPL for both Windows
and Linux, which will make it an attractive target for an McCLIM
backend.  (GTK is available but I find myself drawn more toward QT.  Of
course, this doesn't rule out a GTK backend either.  Hehe - maybe one
could write one program with a native look on BOTH KDE and Gnome :-D.) 
I am pondering undertaking a backend attempt once QT4 comes out for the
sake of creating a Maxima GUI which is a) lisp based and b) cross
platform.  If Scigraph can be made to work and be extended as needed,
this would also provide lisp based graphics in a cross platform manner.
 The half-mythical Stix fonts may also be out by then (at long last
their site was updated - drool.) Logically much of this should
translate relatively easily to Axiom - in fact it should mainly be an
issue of translating between McCLIM constructs and Axiom syntax, with
the added non-trivial wrinkle of line breaking.  (Who knows -
McCLIM+QT4 might just become the best thing for cross platform native
GUI programming since Java, if the planets align right :-).  Lisp will
rise once more!)

I suppose I'm biased against tcl/tk but the Maxima experience with it
has not been terribly positive, and it's not what I tend to think of
when I think robust graphics.  Perhaps this is just my lack of
knowledge.

True.  MinGW is the best available free solution for stand alone
Windows binaries though, at least to my knowledge.  And Windows users +
X applications, in my experience, does not a happy mix make.

Amen.  To both.

It will be HUGE, but yes, that might be workable.  I can't imagine how
Windows users would react to an Xlib base GUI - GTK is bad enough. 
Still, it's a case of any GUI being much better than none, and recent
versions of Cygwin X can at least operate on a per-window basis rathern
than desktop only, so in theory it should work.

I'll second that!  The make install process still goes wonky for me on
Gentoo, and I have seen a second report of the same behavior so it's
probably not just my screwed up system.

Subject: axiom graphics and porting

I've tried 3 paths so far.

First I tried to find an X library that runs natively on windows
without success. So I started working on one and realized that I
didn't know enough of the Microsoft C API to manage it.

Second I tried to use TK as the front end. I was unable to get
the TK front end to display graphics and was unable to find the
source code (since remedied by Camm).

Third I tried to use McClim. I want to use a lisp-based front end
and this was my best hope. Unfortunately I was unable to get it to 
work. 

Finally I wrote a TK-equivalent program in Java. Since it is cross
platform it will run on linux and windows. I have a small working
demonstration for the browser.

The plan is to rewrite the browser and graphics in common lisp and
use a socket based message passing to communicate. The common lisp
rewrite would make it so much easier to port. And the command 
language for the front end could be easily modified to fit the 
choice of front end (TK, Java, McClim).

I'm unhappy about the need for Java and would much prefer McClim.

GCL does not seem to handle run-process correctly so I've been using
CLISP. The browser and the graphics run in their own process anyway
so Axiom under GCL can talk to McClim under CLISP.

Subject: RE: axiom graphics and porting

Hi Tim and Bill.

Several things:

| GCL does not seem to handle run-process correctly

Could you please give us more details?

Without wishing to tell Bill or yourself what to do with your own project
regarding X and/or Cygwin, I think it would be a major mistake to follow
that route for the reasons outlined here:

  http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2004/006716.html

I really can't emphasize my personal lack of interest in such a course of
action enough without actually walking off the GCL Windows job (although I
have no such intention thereof at present).

Be aware also that for a couple of years a GCL binding to the Java GUI
library (JAPI) has existed in our CVS and although only ever tested by me on
Windows, should be fine on Unix as JAPI is cross-platform itself.  I've
inserted below an example program from the GCL source tree to give you a
feel for the way it works - it does various graphics and text things
including a simple mandelbrot display and the (extremely) bare bones of a
text editor.  This program is the only Lisp binding documentation in
existence for the library.  The JAPI binding is included in every Windows
GCL binary release.

Having said that, Camm has always been very enthusiastic about GCL/Tk and it
seems to me that it is a good way to go for that reason alone.  Another
(negative) argument in its favour is that JAPI seems to be moribund whereas
TCL/Tk is, of course, very active.

Hi Camm.

Was this a GCL limitation?  Did you happen to save a record of the
issues you ran into?  I doubt I can succeed where you weren't able to
but it would be interesting to take a look at.  (Sorry, I think I might
have asked this before but I can't find the reply.)

So run-process is the man McCLIM issue?  I've been hoping as GCL gets
closer to ANSI problems with McCLIM would dimish, but perhaps there
will be some more work to do.  Of course, this still leaves writing the
Windows backend, or if QT comes through perhaps a QT4 backend will do. 
Possibly the attempts to write a MacOSX backend (Beagle) will be a good
starting point.  (Me disgustedly ponders the irony of having to get a
Windows box at some point after all ;-).

OK, more detail here would be helpful, but this is not relevant to
2.6.x for axiom, no?

This is quite odd.  I cannot reproduce on my 2.6.6 axiom 20050201:

Didn't we move, at your request if I recall, si::debug to si::debugger
in cvs head (only)?  I've forgotten the details.  Perhaps you could
get some kind of backtrace to see from where your build is referring
to si::debugger.   Tim likely knows how to do this, or, as I've been
recently told, such details can be found in the fourth volume of the
axiom book, targettetd at developers, which can be found somewhere in
tla.

Good point.  While I haven't looked recently at the code, my
understanding is that sman and its subprocesses are written in C.  The
shortest path, then, IMHO, is simply to translate the xlib calls
therein into equivalent versions on native windows, presuming we have
the expertise somewhere.  Next, I would say, is the cygwin idea you
propose below.  If either of these can be worked out, this would give
us breathing space to later do all of this from within lisp in
whatever fashion appears best.

Let me go on record that I defer completely to Mike Thomas' opinions
as to the superiority of the existing mingw work over cygwin from a
technical point of view.  And there is a lot to be said for unity,
epsecially when resources are so limited.  So I much prefer the xlib
translation route described above.  We could even use such work in
xgcl, a lisp interface to xlib included in the distribution.

With all this said, GCL on cygwin is likely quite easy -- the biggest
obstacles are that I will not allow anyone to bother Mike Thomas about
this (:-)), and no other serious GCL developer works on Windows at the
moment.  It would therefore require a dedicated volunteer to patiently
document the progress of the port on gcl-devel@gnu.org, and respond to
remote email help/instructions, most likely from me.  The only real
advantages of cygwin are 1) quite a few people seem to use it and 2)
it presents a simpler migration path from Linux.  But we should again
only turn here if no one knows how to write C graphics on windows.

Wonderful initiative!

These are just my simple thoughts on these broader questions:

1) I worry a lot that concern over graphics, as valuable as it is,
   detracts seriously from developer attention to the core math
   abilities of these systems.

2) In keeping with the above, there seems to be a well-intentioned
   desire to try to attract mass market users with dazzling eye candy.
   My only quibble is one of priority -- what are these attracted
   users going to contribute back to the community?  If we did attract
   them now, are we ready to respond to a deluge of feature requests
   and complaints?  If not, will these users turn against the project
   when their desires are not immediately gratified and the latest
   alternative toy becomes available?

3) I also worry that we are not mass marketing specialists, and that
   we cannot design a system based on what we imagine 'those users out
   there' want.  What we can do is develop the system so that it
   presents real value to the work *we actually do*, fix the bugs that
   bother us, add what we think is imperative for us to be able to
   rely on the system ourselves, etc.  If we do this, others like us
   are bound to see the value too, and some of them will join us.  If
   and when we get a large enough team intimately familiar with the
   system, we can then try to reach out little by little to the mass
   market, who are most likely to be 'takers' rather than 'givers' by
   simple necessity of the overwhelming complexity of these systems. 

4) To the extent that we adopt this perspective, the only critical
   need for graphics in these systems is the ability to plot and print
   mathematical functions, IMHO.  At this early stage in its open
   source life, I would recommend axiom adopt the simplest and most
   portable system with a sizable user base, preferably maintained and
   developed externally, and to then move on to the algorithms.
   Maxima has adopted gnuplot, which I think is a wonderful and
   powerful choice.  We have a working alternative system now and
   there is no need to throw this away, but if we ever feel the need
   to do something new in this area (for example, because our existing
   graphics does not yet work on Windows), this is the direction I
   would recommend for now.

5) In the longer term, lisp graphics is certainly very interesting,
   and some beautiful work from a programming point of view has been
   done, notably the McCLIM to which you refer.  The only problem here
   which is nonetheless quite serious is the lack of unity or
   consensus.  No one can afford to invest the time in putting
   something together if they run the extremely high risk that it will
   be abandoned later due to the extraordinary degree of fractiousness
   in this area.  People need to see the payback measured in terms of
   user contributions in the future -- in this way they lever their
   own efforts.  Ask the question, "If I do this, what new user
   contributions will I likely trigger?"

6) Here is a list of lisp graphics options of which I am aware, all of
   which are workable with possible modest effort within GCL, but none
   of which appear to have any serious use by any existing
   applications.  (Please correct me if I am mistaken:)

        a) xgcl -- http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/cgi/xgcldemo.cgi
        b) gcl-tk -- (tk::connect)(load "...gcl-tk/demos/widget.lsp")
        c) ltk  -- another tk binding
        d) gtk-based -- cl-gtk, lgtk, http://www.cliki.net/Gtk
        e) garnet -- http://garnetlisp.sourceforge.net/
        f) clx, clue, clio, clim, mcclim
        g) cells/cello -- comp.lang.lisp
        h) Java based japi -- lsp/gcl_japi.lsp

7) In deciding among these longer term options, please let me
   emphasize that any are likely workable, but it is very important
   IMHO that we pick at most one if we are to avoid wasting our
   lives.  I also think it important that we

        a) choose a purely open source option

        b) cross-platform

        c) wide user base -- this effectively means a huge C user base
        with a smaller user base of tight lisp bindings

        d) robust

        e) actively developed elsewhere

        f) comes with a graphical interface builder -- as attractive as
        graphical programming in lisp might be, even though it is lisp,
        it is still much less efficient IMHO than using a tool like
        glade.  I've used this myself in C, and I haven't had to write
        a single gtk call.

        g) LGPL is preferable to GPL if we're doing a general
        interface, but I have no problems with GPL myself.

   All of this would appear to argue in favor of cl-gtk or the like.
   Tim Daly Jr. has worked on it, and he indicates it would probably
   take a week's work to get running under GCL.  We need to know how
   good the Windows and MacOSX ports are.  *If we all agree* that this
   is the way forward, I'll be happy to donate a few cycles to moving
   it along.

I think this is wonderful!  If you have the time to take this ball and
lead with it, I'll be happy to support.  As stated above, I think gtk
is a slightly better choice than QT, but *whatever draws consensus* is
the best!

This is well founded, I think.  tk is quick and portable, not
necessarily 'robust and polished'.  The importance of the latter for
these considerations is questionable.  Can you describe the maxima
experience?

My understanding is that this will need a backend on Windows anyway.
I *think* it is conventionally built atop clx, which works just about
'out of the box' on gcl, but everyone these days wants something
higher up than raw xlib.

So you're ready to go here.  Will post this to the errata page for
inclusion in 2.6.7 if any.  We still need to decide on a
cross-platform graphics to talk *to*.  I feel pretty confident we can
get images displayed in gcl-tk in a cross platform manner.  As
discussed elsewhere, this entails a graphics rewrite and is hence a
longer term solution, for which gtk might be a still better option.
Short term, why not just recode the sman C graphics in Windows?
Anyone?

Subject: Re: axiom graphics and porting

Greetings!

Mike, separately, your comments on the following would be most
helpful:

1) How good is gtk (as opposed to tk) on Windows?
2) I remember us discussing the gcl-tk issues on Windows, but cannot
   find the thread at the moment.  My understanding is that the issue
   lies in the socket emulation.  How difficult is this to fix?  Do
   you have an estimate in terms of time?  What could I do from the
   Linux side to assist?
3) Is there an easy analog for an xgcl type interface on Windows?
4) Does the recent patch I just posted on run-process work for
   windows? 

Take care,

Only if it is true that effort by people working on graphics could be
used to do mathematical work.  The skills are somewhat different. 
Currently this may be true, since we have relatively small development
teams on both Maxima and Axiom, but to be fair on both projects the
core functionality (and code cleanup) is much higher priority.  Maxima
as a project hasn't devoted much energy to this since the gnuplot/plot
improvements - wxMaxima is an improvement over Xmaxima, but is being
worked on as a separate project. 

I can safely discuss this because I'm not sufficiently skilled (at
least at this point) to be tinkering with the core mathematical code. 
My most ambitious project to date has been teaching Maxima about units,
which has its wrinkles but can't be considered serious core
functionality.  So I'm not much of a loss on core math issues :-).

Well, I like pretty pictures too ;-) but yes I guess that's the case.

If you mean by directly working on the code, no.  But they will help
build the momentum of the project, and its relevance to people other
than its current developers.

Clearly we aren't, in the sense that everything else we want to take
care of is done.

Possibly.  But what alternative toys are you thinking of?  I doubt
Axiom and Maxima have any serious free competition at the moment -
there is too much work involved building up systems to their current
levels of ability.  I hope Maxima and Axiom can someday both make use
of the same lisp UI code - this will help both projects and enable end
users to use both systems more easily, since they will be using the
same basic GUI and only need to adjust to quirks associated with each
system's unique features and syntax.  I always viewed Maxima as the
"free Mathematica but better" project, and Axiom as something new
focused on theoretical purity and correctness above all else.  I think
these tools are complimentary more than they are competitive, and it
never hurts to have another system to check results in :-).

I don't mind the "takers" so much, since if nothing else they are
involuntary bug testers.  And every "taker" who uses the program
spreads the word.  But I agree a robust system is a better platform to
work from.  Probably what will happen (and is probably already
happening) is that potential takers are downloading and trying out the
system all the time (I think the download figures suggest this,
actually - I remember Tim Daly wondering who all those downloaders
were.)  There are lots of non-serious but curious folk out there, and
even they are good for spreading the word.  We dont' need to advertise
until we feel the system is "ready" but people are of course free to
check it out, so matters will evolve naturally.

I'll agree here, with the hope that expedience can be substituted for
"the right way" at some point in the future when the math is robust
enough.

Probably a decent idea.  I'm not sure how "wonderful" I'd say gnuplot
is (ask Jim what he thinks about it sometime :-), but it does get the
job done reasonably well and it's clearly the best current free
solution.

Unknown, and unknowable currently, for whichever system you might
consider.  :-/.  This has been the primary reason I've not discussed
this more on the Maxima list - I've been waiting to see where the
various toolkits go and what the possibilities are.  We don't need to
make a final choice for quite a while since, as you noted earlier,
there are much more urgent matters to attend to.

Don't know much about this one - my initial reaction is it is too low
level to be attractive for this type of work, assuming it is an
interface to xlib.

>         b) gcl-tk -- (tk::connect)(load "...gcl-tk/demos/widget.lsp")

Has the advantage of being more active, but my tk bias kicks in here so
I'm disqualified.

I think Tim said this looked like the best bet to get things working
quickly?  tk bias again rules me out here.

>         d) gtk-based -- cl-gtk, lgtk, http://www.cliki.net/Gtk

This is promising, but I don't know enough about how "good" these
bindings are to comment.

>         e) garnet -- http://garnetlisp.sourceforge.net/

Ah yes, garnet.  I set up the sourceforge site before I was really
aware of McCLIM, and I still like it as a toolkit, but between it's not
using CLOS and needing a serious modernization of its look and feel... 
Someday it may rise again, but for now I don't think this is the best
choice since it has no active development team to speak of.  This one
will bug me indefinitely because I think it SHOULD be modernized - it
deserves it.  But I can't recommend it at this point.

>         f) clx, clue, clio, clim, mcclim

McCLIM to my mind is the best choice right now, for the following
reasons:

1)  Active development team (we wouldn't have to maintain toolkit and
CAS.)
2)  CLIM is as close to a GUI "standard" as the lisp world gets.
3)  With different backends we might be able to get native look and
feel on a wide variety of platforms - for instance, gtk and QT backends
might let us fit nicely on both Gnome and KDE desktops with one set of
code.

With the exception of Garnet, which was used in some special purpose
apps long ago, McCLIM is the only of these toolkits where I do know of
a program written using it - Gsharp.  There was also the Closure web
browser, although I don't know if that has been maintained.

Can't comment much on this one - haven't figured it out.

>         h) Java based japi -- lsp/gcl_japi.lsp

I would prefer not to rely on Java, but that's just a personal
preference.

On most of the lisp alternatives we should be in the clear as far as
that goes.

>    b) cross-platform

There is no simple solution here, particularly from a lisp based
standpoint - my favorite idea is to wait for QT4, which will have GPL
versions both on Windows and Linux, and create an McCLIM backend for
that.

Um.  You mean lisp bindings to a popular toolkit?

This puts McCLIM at the front of the class in the Lisp GUI department,

Garnet I know had an interface builder, but I was never able to get it

idea.

Maxima is LGPL, and Garnet is public domain - not sure about the
others.

Well, I don't really get to say anything substantial unless I actually

That's one of the reasons I favor McCLIM - it makes the GTK vs. QT
choice not an either/or proposition.

I'm not sure whether I can become skilled enough to do a good set of
bindings, but it would certainly be a challenge.

Essentially the problems stem from us having to fix problems in the
Xmaxima code.  The "included" openmath plots was an odd affair that
never behaved reasonably when scrolled, and getting things working on
Windows was always a challenge for any given release.  I never was able
to figure out the TCL/TK code myself - I know Jim (our project leader)
really didn't want to mess with it.  We did finally get someone who was
knowledgeable to clean it up, but given Maxima is a lisp project we
were of the general opinion it was annoying to have to maintain a UI in
another language.  I'm only one (biased) source though, so I recommend
checking the list archvies for Xmaxima issues.  My memory may be making
it sound worse than it was. 
 
My GTK on Windows misgivings stem mainly from my own experiences with
it - GTK doesn't really "feel" like a native Windows interface.  QT I
know Trolltech supports on Windows as one of their most significant
platforms, and I'm guessing they will do their best to ensure QT apps
look and behave like normal Windows programs.  GTK is workable too, and
I wouldn't be at all opposed to seeing McCLIM+GTK, but my personal
preference would be QT to try and avoid the "this doesn't act like a
regular Windows program" phenomena.  This might have been fixed over
time though, so my reaction could be quite dated.  I haven't used
Windows in a significant way in quite a while, so I have no recent
experience.

No and no :-(  As I said its based on something which was part of the
Inventor toolkit we were using and that is a commercial product which
we were licensing.  However it shouldn't be too difficult to find a
free VRML viewer and adapt that.

I think we looked at GNUPlot and decided it wasn't good enough because
it lacked many of the features for manipulating 3D images that were in
the Unix version.  Using Open Inventor/VRML means you can export images
to industrial-strength visualisation packages which was important to us.
After we released Axiom under Windows, Maple moved their graphics onto
OpenGL (the toolkit Open Inventor is built on) so we're not the only
people who think that this is a good approach :-) Of course GNUplot has
probably come a long way since we looked at it and may be suitable for
your needs, but I doubt its as good as Mathematica and Maple's
offerings.

Don't underestimate the importance of visualisation and computer
algebra.  Over the years I've met a number of users who chose Axiom
primarily because of its graphics.

http://www.web3d.org/vrml/vrml.htm seems to be a good place to start
investigating VRML.

...

-----------

In the meantime VRML has evolved into X3D. See

http://www.web3d.org/x3d/overview.html

And OpenInventor is now available as open source

http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor

and is apparently also available for native Windows

http://www.studierstube.org/openinventor

I think the concepts discussed here by Tim and Mike still apply,
maybe even more so. If Axiom graphics needs to be re-written
and/or modified to be more portable between linux and Windows
then I definitely think that consideration should be given
to compatibility with the web as well. X3D/VRML seems to me
to be a good approach. This looks especially attractive in
the context of the MathAction website since it would allow
Axiom graphics to be served in a compatible manner between
the desktop and a remote graphics browser. This is also
obviously important for the Doyen project.

It seems quite clear that what we called "computer graphics"
yesterday is just going to be some limited form of virtual
reality display in the near future. From my point of view,
if we have to invest significant effort in re-developing
things, then we should aim as high as is practical. Otherwise
it would be better I think to just take the shorter path
(involving Cygwin as described previously).

As far as I can tell right now the only cross-platform
desktop X3G browser is dependent on java

http://www.xj3d.org

but that might change in the next few months as more
options become available.

In any case, perhaps we should seriously consider trying
to recover NAG's work on OpenInventor in Axiom graphics.

I'll take that advice. Do you happen to know of compatible VRML

The browser was a piece of the system that was leading edge
for its time (the web and browsers didn't exist yet). The stated
plan is to "give away" the browser. In this case what that implies
is rewriting the system so it uses a real browser instead of our
home-grown one.

This is good news.

---------

Tim,

Is it correct that the current release of Axiom on linux
includes only this "old stuff"? If so, what are the prospects
for implementing HyperTex using a "real browser" as you
seemed to be planning back in 2002? As I understand it,
that would mean providing a simple web server interface to
Axiom, calling the boot functions written by NAG and running
a standard web browser on the desktop.

All of this sound much easier than porting a low level graphics
application (or even re-writing it to some more portable higher
level GUI like Gtk).

Persumably this approach would also be applicable to the
MathAction interface to Axiom and would provide yet another
thing that could be integrated between desktop and remote
web server for the Doyen project.

Subject: RE: [Gcl-devel] Re: axiom graphics and porting

Hi Camm.

| 1) How good is gtk (as opposed to tk) on Windows?

I haven't used it to write software.  It was ported by Tor Lillqvist to
port the GIMP to Windows.

In terms of end user experience with the GIMP on Windows it seems to be
entirely usable if somewhat clunky and very large and intrusive (you
apparently have to install GTK separately, taking multi-megabytes for all of
the emulation machinery).

I note that the GHC and Moscow ML Glib/GTK bindings each seem to be fairly
sleepy if not dead on Windows - presumably lack of interest or technical
issues or both.


| 2) I remember us discussing the gcl-tk issues on Windows, but cannot
|    find the thread at the moment.  My understanding is that the issue
|    lies in the socket emulation.

Yes, or at least the interprocess communication at some level.


|  How difficult is this to fix?

Relatively simple - I would happily support such a move for 2.7 or even
2.6.7.

|  Do
|    you have an estimate in terms of time?

No.

|  What could I do from the
|    Linux side to assist?

The usual well received debugging/moral support I suppose.

| 3) Is there an easy analog for an xgcl type interface on Windows?

No.

| 4) Does the recent patch I just posted on run-process work for

No; not because of the patch which applies and compiles, but because of
pre-existing problems which I will try to address later this week.

Subject: axiom porting

Lots of discussion and interest on this subject I see...

My current thinking on the matter is that the first priority will
be to just get it working the way it was. This has several dimensions.

The code is now in C/X11, neither of which is very portable. C has
more ifdefs than code and X11 won't work on windows. 

The cygwin path could potentially allow a direct port but is not of
interest for other reasons. I've tried cygwin before as the initial
porting platform and it was painful. Plus, having both cygwin and msys
would be a bit much. So this rules out the X11-on-windows version.

Which implies a rewrite to use a different code base and a
different windowing scheme.

With respect to a code rewrite I've decided to rebuild the code in
common lisp for several reasons. First, it is easier to port. Second,
it is a language I know well. Third, it will allow us to "lift" the
windowing functions up into the axiom system proper so other people
can create windows in their code. Fourth, it will allow the unification
of windowing/graphing data structures and spad data structures.

With respect to the windowing scheme we are confronted with a large
variety of front-end mechanisms. In any of the proposed mechanisms
we need a working example of, for instance, the first page of the
hyperdoc browser. That will ground the proposals in reality. For example,
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/TimothyDaly_files/pamphlets/jman.pamphlet

The current plan is to have some sort of dumb front-end that implements
some low-level graphics API and move the rest of the code into lisp.
The graphics API needs to cover both the browser and graphics abilities.

As I've mentioned I've tried various paths. Camm, Bill, and I had a 
discussion about these during the sprint day. Camm pointed me at the
sources for TK. I've already written a piece of a TK replacement in Java.

TK might work. I'm going to the bookstore today to get educated about
the details. Since both TK and my Java code use sockets it would seem
that we could use a common syntax. Such an approach would make it easy
to shift between the two front ends. I'm not sure how feasible this is.

I've looked at GNUPLOT but their license does not seem to allow me to
modify and distribute. And their code has more ifdefs than C code which
is a sure sign of a porting headache.

I've looked at McClim which is a path I'd dearly love to take but so
far I've not gotten it to work. If someone could reproduce the first
page of the browser (a few buttons, an image) in McClim that might be
enough to get me over the hurdle. A pure lisp solution is preferred.

The graphics and browser run in separate threads using sockets to
communicate to the algebra. Due to the run-process issue in GCL the
front end is being done using CLISP but nothing in the code cares
which lisp is used.

I've spoken to Tim Daly Jr. about the lisp-gtk work and he believes
it is not ready for production use.

The SVG, VRML, CSG, and Flash enhancements would be nice but are
definitely in the future development categories. There is still a
huge amount of algebra work to be done before any work gets applied
to enhancing the graphics.

Of course, it's all open to discussion.

I asked a few questions there but I'm too much of a newbie. My questions
make it look like I'm asking them to write the code (which I'm not).
Once I have a simple working example I can reverse-engineer the rest
of it.

Then point your browser to localhost:8080.  You should be able to get
directory listings and files.  There is obviously no protocol nor
error implementation here, but that should be straightforward for the
web gurus.

This will accept multiple simultaneous connections and process them
one at a time.  The delay mechanism can obviously be adjusted.  Each
connection is stateless -- a multiplexing solution for persistent
connections can be implemented in like manner.  Also, all connections
are in the same process.  It is trivial to fork() in linux for each
connection, but don't know how this would be done on Windows.
Speaking of which, does MS have select?  There are other hooks for
allowing work in the image while connections are handled in the
background, e.g. SIGIO, but don't know the portable nor most desirable
way of doing this.

Anything can be done here that one wishes -- my question is, what is
the advantage vis a vis an external server like apache?  Presumably,
axiom could spit out results directly instead of being called in a
cgi, which is of some value.  Anyway, more discussion on where and why
this should go if anywhere would be great!

Take care,

Thanks Camm!

The diff command suggests that this code is already in GCL 2.6.6.
Is that correct?

Should I expect the code below to work "out of the box" with the
Windows version of GCL 2.6.6?

Yes! It is a very significant value if one were to try to implement Axiom's
HyperTex browser in a "real browser" as per my previous email and
discussed by Mike Dewar and Tim Daly.

My short term objective is to have a simple way to "prove" the
portability of socket connections in GCL, specifically HTTP
access, between Linux and Windows.

My goal is to be in a reasonable position to argue for the following:

I think that using a browser to implement the Axiom gui would be
an excellent way to solve the problem of porting Axiom HyperTex
and Graphics. It seems an extreme waste of scarce resources to
spend time on re-implementing something based on a model that
is now more than 10 years old - that's ancient given the rate at
which this technology is developing. A browser interface would
also be automatically compatible with the web and easily integrated
into web server applications like MathAction.

I have played with HyperTex as now implemented in the most
recent release of open source Axiom and frankly in comparison
to modern browser interfaces, it looks primitive and awkward.
Except for it's ability to simply navigate Axiom's algebra library,
I doubt that it can have much appeal to current computer users.

NAG did a lot of work on Axiom to make it compatible with
Techexplorer on Windows and to replace the old (even then!)
HyperTex browser with something newer and more powerful.
This included adding special code to Axiom to navigate the
Axiom library that was intended to work with a "real browser".
(Techexplorer was essentially IBM's first entry as a mathematics
capable web browser. It is still available in another commercial
incarnation but unfortunately not as part of open source Axiom.)

NAG also apparently did a lot of work on porting Axiom graphics
to OpenInventor. OpenInventor lead to VRML and is now known
as X3D. Since OpenInventor is now open source, I think we are in
an excellent position to take advantage of this work. VRML is also
well adapted to integration with web applications.

The down side is that as far as I know very little documentation is
available for the work that was done by NAG. I am also not certain
exactly how much of this code was in the source package that was
originally delivered to Tim Daly from NAG. My hope is that someone
like Mike Dewar would be willing to work with us develop the
necessary documentation so that we could adapt that work to
currently available open source software.

The benefits of open source and free aside, if Axiom must compete
with commercial products like Mathematica and Maple for a share
of the academic symbolic computer market, then I think we must
aim a little higher than simply providing Axiom as it existed 10 years
ago. And aside from it's superiority in supporting research in new
mathematical algorithms, there are other features of Axiom (especially
Axiom's graphics) that potentially place it still somewhat ahead of
what is available in the commercial M&M's. I think the sooner we
can make these features available in the open source version of
Axiom, the better chance we will have of attracting some serious
interest.

The small patch needs to be applied (to o/file.d) and saved_gcl
recompiled.  If this is an obstacle, please let me know.  I could
provide a loadable accept if needed.

This obviously has advantages in portability and features -- nice
suggestion!  The memory footprint might be quite high, but one
doesn't have to use the browser, I suppose.  And I hope we don't have
to get into issues of conflicting browser capabilities, etc.   I
suppose it is important that the help browser offer dynamic content,
as it does currently.  Otherwise, with static examples, one could just
launch a separate browser process pointed at an html documentation
tree.  For dynamic content, your idea above is the way to go.

We will have to address the following at some point should we go down
this road:

1) axiom hyperdoc forks on each connection -- this leaves the
   controlling terminal free to pursue other work, but any changes
   therein after the browser was launched would be invisible to the
   borwser process.  Might need to watch the number of connections
   here. 

2) The axiom read loop spends a fraction of its time polling for
   activity on the hyperdoc channel, and processes it immediately and
   serially when present.

3) The user locks the controlling terminal with the browser server
   function, which is terminated when the browser is shut down.

Also we have the issues of

4) persistent connections, or we write an involved state machine with
   cookies, etc. 

5) connecting the hyperdoc documentation to the pamphlet files in a
   seemless fashion -- would be wonderful to be able to inline the
   examples here.

And I thought I'd mention

6)  I have code which implements an SSL encryption over-layer should
    we ever need this, though I can't imagine why we would.

Then I think we need either you or Mike Thomas to test this little
example.  There may be unresolved socket issues on Windows remaining,
though we have sucessfully tested little netcat examples earlier as
posted to gcl-devel.  Please let me know of any difficulties.

All extremely well taken!  

Two thoughts:

1)  There are so many ??ML variants that appear to come and go in a
    quasi-faddish manner, at least to an outsider like me.  Would be
    great if we can stick to something simple, universal, and eternal
    :-).  

2)  I'm wondering if a browser interface like this might also be able
    to provide some kind of integrated 'inlined-notebook' that at
    least the old mathematica versions had.  Math, text, TeX, and
    graphics all inlined in the sequence in which one works.  Like
    texmacs, I suppose, or imaxima for maxima using my favorite
    program -- emacs :-).  Can we centralize on one interface?  Would
    this be advisable?

But here we're doing something new upfront, no?  Would a small initial
stage project of rewriting the xlib calls to MS equivalents in the
hypertex C code give us a little more time to evaluate different lisp
options?  After all, this only need be done on one port, Windows.

Well, run-process will talk to any external windowing program.  The
trick is in abstracting all the options to one lisp api, and this
would appear hopeless.  My opinion is that we need to choose one that
will last us at least ten of the next thiry years, and make it work
well.  

Let me just briefly bring up the issue of performance, which is likely
of little concern to us.  Talking down a pipe to an external program
will never be as fast as making the windowing calls directly from the
image, which is also possible.  Unless we're contemplating animation,
I don't think we'll ever see the difference.

gnuplot is completely free software -- it passes the widely accepted
definitions found in the Debian Free Software Guidelines, and is thus
in Debian's main (not non-free or contrib) archive.  You can
distribute any modifications you wish in the form of patches.

As to portability, this is perhaps the most widely portable option at
the present moment.  It might not have been an easy job, but someone
else already has done it, and is continuing to do so, which appears to
me highly attractive from axiom's vantage point.

Perhaps, but all the solutions will require work, alas, and what one
gets with gtk is glade.  Please take a moment and play with the
program.  The entire interface is generated graphically, with no
coding in any language, and dumped as a purely portable xml file.
There is cl-glade which loads this interface into acl.  I've
downloaded it, and it can be made to work in GCL, but I'll refrain
from spending time here unless we are sure this is the way we'd like
to go.

Hi Camm.

I checked into HEAD yesterday a fix which works with the test snippet you
provided in a separate email to Tim.  I note that the interface (on Unix
also I believe) is not robust in the sense that it doesn't check the type or
number of arguments to the function, but otherwise it looks fine.

No, but for the record it's caused by the following change:

http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gcl/gcl/pcl/defsys.lisp.diff?r1=1.4&
r2=1.5

the purpose of which escapes me.  The problem is that on Windows the name of
the file being passed to COMPILE-FILE in "pcl/defsys.lisp" is incomplete
when that new version of the file is used.

Reversing that change then leads to a further problem which I have yet to
investigate.

Thanks!  Had forgotten there was so much difference with mingw here,
but at least this appears to imply that there is some windows version
of fork() :-).  At some point, perhaps we can boil the ifdefs down to

OK, this was along the path of supporting unique init function names
for our profiling users.  When gprof is enabled, the patch (yet
committed in entirety) will place the full filename in the C init
function name, so that ld will not complain of duplication.  This
obviously poses a challenge for the likes of unixport/sys_foo.c in
attempting to find the init function name, so I was trying to
centralize all GCL supplied system files with a pathname-directory of
nil passed to compile file.  This boils down to the current directory
on Linux, but I guess not on Windows.  Can you see why not?  Is there
anyway to make this behavior identical?

Subject: axiom porting

I'm a bit overwhelmed by the volume of suggestions.

The browser idea has promise except that I don't see how to handle
the graphics. I also don't see how to "command" a browser
through a socket to do things like open a new tab. 

But it does give us the advantage of an already portable front
end. The dynamic content doesn't seem to be much of an issue.
There is an asq command that can compute answers to database queries.
And if Axiom could handle server requests it would be easy to
serve up algebra (might even be a reason to send Bill to China).

I've been clinging to reproducing the prior work as it gives me a
fixed target to achieve. Otherwise it becomes an open-ended design
problem and it will never be finished. Perhaps this is misguided.

I actually have no idea what gtk is despite the fact that my son was
involved in developing it. And I'm not sure what glade is.

I did try to "rewrite the xlib calls to MS equivalents" but the model
for graphics is wildly different. I suppose this is why no one has 
taken this path.

I did get the run-process patch you sent but have not yet applied it.
I'm still working on merging the BSD patches which have been hanging-fire
behind the axiom conference work. Hopefully I'll complete that tonight.

Then I need to look at the GUESS domain and see what it will take to
merge that.

THEN I'll look at the G/B (graphics/browser) issue. Since I'm not
actively coding this is a good time to debate the issue.

Here are some examples.

Apart from the slowness of launching GIMP (by far the slowest to launch on
my system) as the vast quantity of Unix emulation dlls and other GTK
machinery loads, common items such as the file selectors are completely
foreign to Windows users and considerably less usable than their Windows
equivalents.  Occasionally one ends up with menus which somehow become
detached from the parent program and which can't be closed and which
simultaneously lock the parent so that the program has to be killed through
the process manager - perhaps fixed now, I am certainly out of date, but
then again, what a hassle to continually update and harmonise stuff I don't
want to know about.


|  And how temporary might this be?

Who would know?  Probably a long time.  The only major GTK applications I'm
aware of on Windows are Glade and the GIMP which means that a large segment
of GTK is presumably largely untested on Windows.

Here is a link:

  http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/

Added to this is the issue of potential clashes between various application
builds and the currently installed version of GTK, which is the reason

Not at the moment as I suspect it will clash with my version of GTK and
GIMP!  Perhaps over the weekend.  Hopefully you can see roughly where it's
at from the comments above.

Although Glade definitely sounds like a very big plus, it also seems there
is a lot more work involved with GTK than just getting GCL/Tk up on Windows
both for developers and end users.

OK, now I'm confused.  threads need reentrancy, no?  None of our code
has been checked in this regard, and there are known issues with
things like gc.  Yet our mingw port can both run gcc and do
run-process, both of which exist atop fork() on unix.  Are these using
some type of threading?  Or rather is a completely unrelated process
with an entirely distinct memory image started?  fork() on unix these
days uses copy on write pages, making it fairly lightweight.  Am I
right in assuming that if we did server sockets with the idea of a
separate process handling each connection, that we would have to start
an entirely new gcl on windows to do such (i.e. inheriting no work
done previously in the session), at least at the moment?   Would this
effectively double the virtual memory consumption?

OK.  This still leaves us with the three broad options for server
sockets: multitasking, file descriptor/standard input multiplexing, or
user server invocation.

The existing hooks in the original code stores the server function in
the socket stream itself.  This makes natural the idea that once one
does (si::socket p :server #'foo), the connection handling, or the
accepting, or both should be registered and handled automatically.  It
would be nice to get a feel for how people would like this to work.

Amen.  KDE users on Linux have been making fun of GTK's file selection

This is my sense too - I know a few other GTK applications have been
ported but I do not have the sense it is a major movement.  Hence my
excitement at GPL QT4, which up until version 4 was commercial ONLY on
Windows - indicating it must work reasonably well.  With any luck an
McCLIM backend to that could be made to work well and reliably on both
platforms.

Actually, I just gave in to temptation again and installed the latest
Windows GDK; Glade is a bit of a mess.  Background windows pop up when the
mouse moves in other windows, menus are left hanging etc. My suspicion is
that this is caused by trying to map the GTK signal structure onto the
Windows event loop system.

If someone was planning (I'm certainly not) to write a cross platform
backend to McClim I personally would be telling them to use WxWidgets, which
has been connected up very nicely in both the Scheme and Haskell worlds and
is much lighter weight than GTK while retaining good cros-platform
performance and appearance.

hung/broken pipes etc.

| Thanks!  My peanut sized brain parses this as 'it should work, but it

I think that's a good way of looking at it.  I've never used select()
myself.  That function, like all of the others in the Microsoft Visual C
Runtime, including standards like "fopen()", is built on top of far more
sophisticated functions in the real Windows system APIs - ie, the ones you
get through <windows.h>.

So select() is based on WaitForMultipleObjects() and fopen() on CreateFile()
and there are really no such things as either file descriptors or FILE *.
They are, rather, an illusion built on the true workhorse of the Windows OS,
namely, HANDLE's.

In short, the entire Microsoft Visual C++ runtime was designed as a sop for
Unix C programmers and, in fact, a well designed Windows program does not
bother with any of those artifacts whatsoever.

OK, so glade on windows is only part there, I take it.  What is really
central is whether libglade can open up a glade-output xml interface
on windows, which might be somewhat less onerous.

Did a little searching for the opinions of others.  Thought this ruby
user's summary was perhaps most relevant for us:

http://www.wonko.com/content.php?id=301

wxwidgets has the native 'look and feel', but glade is 'By far the
easiest to use'...  To me, we are far from being able to design high
quality gui's, let alone contribute to the cross-platform gui
development model.  All we can hope for is passable, serviceable, and
cross-platform, I'd think.  With these resources, ease of use appears
paramount. 

There is also wxglade, but this appears in its infancy, and it is
unclear if there is xml/libglade support:

http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/

Needess to say, if it proves to be as functional as glade, this is
definitely the way to go, at least in the long term.  Don't have time
to investigate right now, alas.

Fair enough, but in the absense of some well-polished, very easy to
use, open source, massively exercised, cross-platform alternative,
this would appear the least of our concerns at this juncture. 

Whatever we choose will be less than desirable -- what we need is to
select wisely given a carefully chosen set of priorities.

The scheme hooks you mention argue strongly in wxwidgets' favor, of
course.

Here are my summary opinions at this point -- feedback most
appreciated!  (Just a note of clarification -- tcl/tk, which exists in
GCL now and is a portable scripting language, is *not the same* as
GTK+, an extremely widely used C library with multi-language bindings
running 'in-process')

=============================================================================
Goal: generic GCL gui  -- short term
=============================================================================

1) get the somewhat clunky but serviceable gcl-tk (i.e. tcl/tk)
   working on all platforms as quickly as possible (Need feedback from
   Mike and/or Bill)

2) make sure gcl-tk can display bitmaps (I'll take care of this)

=============================================================================
Goal: generic GCL gui  -- long term
=============================================================================

   Choose an in-process gui option according to the following ranked
   priorities:

        1) open source

        2) massively exercised in the open source world, which for all
           intents and purposes means the core C libraries used by the
           open source desktops with a thin lisp binding option

        3) universally portable

        4) easy to use, preferrably with a graphical gui builder.

        5) native 'look and feel'

        6) supports the option of a higher level lisp layer like
           mcclim.  This to my understanding can just be layered on
           top of a thin lisp binding layer. 

        7) lgpl better than gpl.  Just to be clear here, if qt4 is
           selected, all apps using this will be GPL when distributed
           in binary form -- Mike Thomas has voiced reservations about
           this in the past, but it doesn't particularly bother me.

    We should not do any work on this, IMHO, unless we have a
    confirmed user of such a system.  As I state below, axiom and the
    other systems currently using gcl might be more easily serviced in
    other ways.  

    My feeling is that depending on wxglade functionality, this would
    result in wxwidgets > gtk+ > qt4

Goal: portable axiom hypertex

=============================================================================

This would appear best served by Bill Page's browser idea with GCL
server sockets.  For now, I will work on providing
fork()/CreateProcess() options, and select/stdio multiplexing options,
to the si::socket function call.  We will postpone threads unless
someone wants to volunteer some work here.  The windows fork() analog
of CreateProcess() will require some work in this context, as
basically the code will have to save the server function in a .lsp or
.o file, and restart gcl or axiom with a command line instruction to
load and execute the file (or do same with pipes).  I suggest we don't
bother working on this again unless we have a confirmed user -- axiom
might be serviced by the user invocation and/or stdio multiplexing
options.  But fork() is a great option to have on Linux, so we should
put it in, IMHO.

Goal: portable axiom graphics

=============================================================================

This is unlikely to be well serviced by a web browser, and only
modestly well-serviced by a standard gui, as axiom's demands on plot
manipulation are likely to require such detail as canned 'widgets' are
unlikely to be available.  I really feel gnuplot is the best tool here
in the medium term, which can be fully accessed cross-platform under
GCL at the present time via run-process.  Please check out the maxima
webpages for soem very pretty pictures (aka dazzling eye candy :-))!

These are just my thoughts, of course.  Feedback always most welcome!
