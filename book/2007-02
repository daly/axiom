There were many plans to rewrite various parts of Axiom.  I decided
to actually rewrite one part: the asq program :).

Actually my reasons for rewrite were:

1) Old asq was broken by trivial changes to database format (like
   turning off compression, or pretty printing databases), the
   new one should be more resistant.
2) Old asq was longish, verbose and used very unusal coding style.
3) Some people (Bill Page ???) hoped to use asq as a base for
   browser access to Axiom databases, the new one hopefully is
   easier to adapt/change than the old one.

Since the output of old asq was rather irregular, I have taken
liberty to change output formatting and command line options.
I hope that such change will cause no troubles.

Since the old asq documentation mostly duplicated daase.lisp.pamphlet,
I have written also completly new (short) documentation.

P.S.  I just commited the new asq to wh-sandbox.

Dear Waldek,

Did you see the mail where I set a price? Well, I repeat the relevant bit here
anyway, slightly modified to make the intention clearer:

(Modifications in [...])


**OLD MAIL*********************************************************************
I think it's time to set a price again. I'll pay 100$ anyone who writes a new,
or modifies an existing program, that displays [in a standard webbrowser] the
documentation of a +++ environment (and only this bit of documentation) as
generated by ALLPROSE, on demand, i.e., using a web interface similar to that
Tim provided.

To get started, do the following

----------------------------------------------------------------------

svn co svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk

cd combinat/trunk/combinat

notangle -t8 Makefile.nw > Makefile

make VARIANTSTOBUILD=axiom

cd lib

for f in $(ar t libcombinatax.al); do ar x libcombinatax.al $f; done
for f in $(ar t libcombinatax.al); do echo ")lib $f" >> combinat.input; done

cd ../src

axiom

-- now everything of combinat is available. To generate a libdb.text say

)se co args "-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y $AXIOM/algebra -i ../include"

)co csseries
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(very likely, there is an easier way to generate the libdb file.)

To explain the process a bit: (Ralf, please correct me if I'm wrong)

  make VARIANTSTOBUILD=axiom

extracts using noweb documentation and code from the source files, for example
series.as.nw. All of the code and the api description (i.e., everything between
\begin{+++} ... \end{+++} ) is put into a file csseries.as.

")co csseries" is one way to extract the +++ strings and write them into
libdb.text.

The best thing would be, of course, if one could simply call tex4ht on the
individual +++ strings. One would have to write a suitable LaTeX preamble, of
course, that \usepackages the appropriate style files. However, I do not know
how hyperlinking will work then. (In fact, I don't even understand hyperlinking
within ALLPROSE, and Ralf begs me to read the documentation since a few
months...)

Maybe it also makes sense to run a preprocessor over the literate
program. I.e., to modify ALLPROSE so that preprocecessed LaTeX (for example
html) is put into a database. But I would like the other solution better.

It would already be a great thing if doc could be displayed without
hyperlinks. That shouldn't be too hard, I believe.

**END OLD MAIL*****************************************************************

Here is a bit of the generated libdb.text:


dDataStream`1`x`(CoercibleTo(OutputForm))->etc`(T)`DATASTR`\begin{adusage}      T == Integer      s: \adthistype{} T := \adname{stream: T -> %} 0;      s := \adname{stream: Generator T -> %}(generator [1, 3]);      g: \adtype{Generator} T == generate for i in 2.. repeat yield i;      s := \adname{stream: Generator T -> %} g;    \end{adusage}    \begin{addescription}{Implements an infinite array.}      The domain \adthistype{} can be abstractly seen as an infinite      array. However, to make thi----s data structure finite, it is more      appropriate to view it as a pair $(a, g)$ of an      \adcode$\adtype{Array}(T)$ and a \adcode$\adtype{Generator}(T)$.        Like \adtype{Array}, \adthistype{} is 0-based.    \end{addescription}



Non-standard environments and commands:

adusage and addescription are environments, adname, adthisname, adtype,
adthistype commands defined in combinat/trunc/allprose/aldordoc.sty.nw.

Below is a very short description, to see the full thing say

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cd combinat/trunk/combinat

make include-allprose-documentation colored html

konqueror doc/combinat.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and go to Section 33.


The short description:

adusage: explains how to use the constructor/operation by example

addescription: the argument of the environment is a one-line description, the
         body a more detailed one

\adname: markup for a constant or operation. Should be hyperlinked to the
         appropriate constant, operation.

\adtype: markup for a type constructor. Should be hyperlinked to the
         appropriate type constructor.

\adthisname: expands to the constant or operation we are currently looking
         at. (should not occur if we are just defining a type...)

\adthisname: expands to the constructor we are currently looking at, or, if we
         we are just defining a constant or an operation, the constructor it
         belongs to. In the example above, it expands to DataStream.


You can find the DataStream example properly typeset in Section 22.1.

To see an operation, look at stream: Generator T -> % (roughly five pages below
the definition of DataStream, which, in libdb.text reads as follows:

ostream`1`x`(Generator(T))->_$`dDataStream(T)``\begin{adusage}      T == Integer;      g: \adtype{Generator} T := generator [2,4,6,7];      s: \adthistype{} T := \adthisname{} g;    \end{adusage}    \begin{adparameters}      \adparameter{g: Generator Integer} A (finite or infinite)      generator that computes the next values of the stream.    \end{adparameters}    \begin{addescription}{Construct a stream.}      The function constructs the stream      \begin{gather}        (g_1, g_2, g_3, \ldots----)      \end{gather}      or (informally) the infinite array      \begin{adsnippet}        [x for x in g]      \end{adsnippet}      where $g_i$ is the $i$-th element generated by the generator $g$.        In case the stream $g$ is finite and generates $n$ elements then      the result is      \begin{gather}        (g_1,...,g_{n-1}, g_n, g_n, g_n, \ldots).      \end{gather}    \end{addescription}    \begin{adremarks}      It is allowed to call \adthisname{} with a generator that does not      --ge--nerate any element, but the resulting stream may not be ask to      reveal any of its entries, since there are none. It is basically      the same to say \adcode$\adthisname(generate)$ and      \adcode$\adname{new}()$.    \end{adremarks}



It is a mystery to me how Ralf did the linking magic. Maybe he or the
combinat.aux file can help...

I think I have to reply to Martin's mail.

I don't have experience with the database, but slightly different from 
what Martin wants, my intensions would go into another direction (which 
are as a first approximation completely independent of ALLPROSE).

The Aldor compiler puts the ++ comments into the .ao files. Using

aldor -fasy file.ao

one basically gets all the information that is relevant, ie, code and ++ 
comments at the right place. Furthermore if one includes

   -lalgebra -laldor

on the above command line, the compiler extracts exports from the 
libraries and puts them into some place of domains in file.ao. That 
would give a list of *all* the exports of a domain/category in file.ao.

Anyway, an .asy file basically is a LISP file, if I am not completely 
wrong. So for a LISP expert that should be not too difficult to make 
sense of it.

My current plans (no time for actually writing some code) would be to 
take that .asy file and produce a .tex file which could be compiled into 
.html via tex4ht. Actually, I go only via .tex because ALLPROSE uses the 
convention to write a LaTeX-like syntax into the ++ comments.

Actually, ALLPROSE already contains the API, but not in an API-only 
form. And I would very much like that one could fold and unfold the 
*complete* list of exports of a domain and to have references from 
categories to domains that use that category.

Come on, Martin, there is no mystery. Since ALLPROSE introduced some 
conventions of how to write domain and category definitions, it is quite 
easy to extract their names from the code and put them into 
\addefinetype{...}. When you use \adtype{...} it links to the place 
where \addefinetype is. The definition of \addefinetype and \adtype 
basically use commands from the hyperref LaTeX package and add some 
indexing and color information. That is not too much magic.

I believe the conventional wisdom would suggest that you add your name
as co-author as opposed to replacing the existing author, even if you
have rewritten it. If this were a separate new program not building on
previous ideas, I would that it is OK.

Hmm, I undersand that conventional wisdom is to err on side of giving
more credit for work than too little credit, but I find this suggestion
a little extreme.

Gaby, did you look at both programs: the new asq is a _new_ program.
Re-used from the old program is starting Latex boilerplate, Latex
footer and AXIOM variable (assignment and a test).  On the level of
ideas of course I re-used the very idea of having such a program
and tried to make it compatible (in particular I re-used most of
the option names).  Also the general approach (using linear search)
is common.  But that is basically all.

About 70% of the new program is a start of generic S-expression handling
library which has no couterpart in the old program.  The rest is also
very different (in particular much simpler) due to use of S-expressions
and table driven option handling.

I think it is proper to have acknowledgement line like:

  This program replaces an older one written by Tim Daly.

(the exact wording may be different).

If the program is more or less completely new then it is OK if Waldek 
just puts himself as an author. But removing Tim completely is, of 
course, no option.

Waldek, what about including the above information of what you took over 
and what you simplified in addition to the line (*)? You probably also 
took over the interface since otherwise your program cannot simply 
replace Tim's asq.

I think that Tim has already stated it before: respect.

I'm not so sure.

| Gaby, did you look at both programs: the new asq is a _new_ program.

I read over your new "asq" and the old asq and followed your
explanation, *before* I sent my mail.

My opinion is that your name should be added co-author, not replace
the original author.  Or, call the program something else and
acknowledge that this new program greatly benefited from the existing
one, in particular from its documentation and its errors. But having
two proram doing almost the same thing will be very confusing.  So, I
believe the conventional wisdom is good here.

A ways to kepp a project attractice and collegial is to be cautious
with credit.

Look at GCC for example.  Most parts of it have nothing common with
the GCC from 1996 or 1997.  In particular, look at the C preprocessor;
it has been *completely* rewritten from scratch, with readically
different ideas.  Nonetheless, the authorship displays the people who
did not "directly" contribute to the new program in any form.

I fail to see how filename affects authorship status of a file.  FYI
I developed under different name outside of Axiom tree.  I started
copying a few lines from old asq but quickly realized that old code
do not fit into my design.  So I wrote the program essentially from 
scratch.  <heresy> After the program was finished I have put literate
wrapper around it and dropped it into the source tree </heresy>.
IMHO the few copied lines are not more significant than a few declarations
that I copied form man pages.

Note that I do not claim any credit for the old asq program.  And
I think that we should prominently state that previous version was
due to Tim Daly.  But the \authors{} construct seem too limited
to correctly express such information.

AFAICS changing file name limits possibilty for
misunderstanding authorship, but is an inconvenience for users
(still, if you guys think that renaming is a way to go I will do
it).  I do not consider keeping the old program as an option:
main reason to write the new one was that the old one does not
work with other changes that I am making.

I do not see information about authors in preprocessor program files,
only note like:

   Copyright (C) 1986, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998,
   1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006
   Free Software Foundation, Inc.
   Contributed by Per Bothner, 1994-95.
   Based on CCCP program by Paul Rubin, June 1986
   Adapted to ANSI C, Richard Stallman, Jan 1987

IMHO such note is misleading by ommision, but at least dates allow
to infer that this information is highly incomplete.  I see
Richard Stallman mentioned as a coauthor of cpp.texi, but comparing
cpp.texinfo from gcc-1.35 with cpp.texi from gcc-4.1.1 I can find
a few passages are taken almost verbatim from the old version.
I would guess that careful examination would show more connections.
So I consider it reasonable to state that Stallman is a coauthor
(assuming he did wrote version contained in gcc-1.35). 

Concering programs: I did not look at preprocessor files.  But I did
found surprising similarities between some parts of gcc-1.35 and 
parts of gcc-4.1.1 -- after many edits code looks very different,
but clearly is still the same code.

Me enither.  Why do you think it has anything to do with this?

Yes, and listing only your name as author implies claiming credits.

The prominent omission is the name of the second author you found in
cpp.texi to which we should add that of Neil Booth.  You can cross
check those assertions either by looking the ChangeLog or digging the
archives (don't look at the ChangeLog in libcpp/, look at those in gcc/).

The original CPP worked on strings (contrary to ISO C specification),
and was an external program.  The new CPP works on tokens and is
integrated to the C-family front-ends.  There are very signficant
differences.  The authors took the pain to preserve the old behaviour
through within the new, correct, implementation.

Put blunt, I think you did a grave act of violence by replacing
the existing asq.c with the new one witout explicit acknowlegement as
co-author (which I believe is the correct thing), and  acknowledgment
section that traces the history of asq.c.

It would be very interesting to see which portions of which files you
look at.

I am shocked by your words.  For me "author" has clear meaning: 
somebody who wrote the work or nontrivial part of it or at least had
significant influence on the shape of the work.  I somebody replaced
something that I wrote by new thing but kept my name as an author
I would probably ask to romove my name -- taking credit for something
taht I did not would only devaluate credits due for things that I
really did.  However, if Tim Daly feels as a coauthor of new asq
I will add his name.  But I will not do this without his explicit
permission.

Concerning acknowledgment: I did a mistake here -- I was concetrating
on technical details and forgot about it.  I would like to correct
this problem but opinions I hear from you (Gaby) and Ralph are
widely different.

IIRC this was in the C front end.  But I am not sure if disscusing
gcc authorship is relevant here (what you wrote above only strengthened
my impression that gcc is not a good model to follow).

The point I wanted to make is: even if evolved text/code looks quite
different from the original its form is usually significantly
influenced by original author (and in many cases this influence
can be seen).  I feel that "start from scratch" rewrite is quite
different.

Well, calling a program something else is not a matter of file-name.
You could very well put your codes in the *same* file asq.c, while
retaining the previous.   But, that is not what is not.  You have
*replaced* the existing one.

yes, but I had not seen you putting Tim's name as co-author and he
asking for taking his name out.  And in this case, I do believe that
Tim's initial effort and continued documentation (even not perfet,
e.g. duplication) does contribute  substantially to the new code.

I just think we should not refrain for giving enough credits if we
ever want the place to be collegial and attracts more people.

| IIRC this was in the C front end.

As I said, the C preproprocessor is a different component now,
separate from the C-family front-ends, with the integration done with
the parser -- instead of through temporary files as in the past.
Look at libcpp/.

I'm not sure.  People contributing new components get their names in.
Others, such as Richard Henderson, are so universally recognized that
they don't think they need to put down their names :-)

In the interests of keeping this discussion productive, can anyone
point to an established (and insofar as is possible objective) standard
for evaluating when co-authorship credit should be awarded and when an
effort is sufficiently new to warrant sole authorship with a history? 
I don't suppose simply diffing the files and looking for some minimum %
changed would be enough, but is there some relatively objective
criteria that can be established here to avoid friction?
 
I understand credit is something people feel strongly about,
particularly in an academic and open source enviornment, so I think it
would be beneficial to have some policy in this regard.  I suspect this
situation is a bit unique - normally academic papers are not
sufficently direct in lineage to provoke a discussion on whether
authors of previous work should have co-authorship credit in the new. 
If we treat Axiom in this fasion (literate programming and whatnot), I
would say the old pamphlet should be cited in appropriate places in the
new one in academic style (after all, if you want to re-use a graph
from an old paper, say in a thesis, you get and include permission and
then cite the source).  An Axiom journal would be a major asset in this
respect, as new versions of pamphlets could be published in one section
of it and become true citable papers.

It's actually a bit of an interesting problem, because we don't want to
dilute authorship credits to the point of not being useful (which
author do you contact if a work lists twenty, and it turns out sixteen
of them worked only on previous versions and don't know anything about
the new one?)  Even in regular computer science channels, there tends
to be a paper published that doesn't directly involve the source code -
really using the literate programming paradigm (where a paper building
on previous work to produce a better result will not just reference
other work but actually include it as part of the foundation on which
they are building subsequent work, as in this case) seems to introduce
some rather unique problems and deserves some careful consideration
about what practices should be used.

One thought might be to include certain "metadata" in the chunck
structure which could be used to automatically add citations and
credits - if we make an emacs mode (say) that when it reads an Axiom
pamphlet parses the metadata and tracks what is changed - then each
chunck knows who changed it and who didn't, and can automatically
produce citation links on that basis (for example, a code block that
survives unchanged through 4 major pamphlet revisions need only refer
to the original, since that is where it came from.)  Maybe one of the
many source code management systems we have available could even
automate this feature based on commit diffs and who is commiting?  Then
the question of "who wrote what" can be quickly and definitively
answered.  If desirable there could be some "primary authorship"
decided based on how much of the current code is new compared to
previous versions.  Peer review could be used to override abuses of the
system (for example, making unnecessary and trivial changes in enough
parts of the code to claim primary authorship.)

Imperfect ideas I'm sure, but maybe someone else has something better
to suggest?

Cheers,
CY

I know that this is not the current development process, but I think
Tim has explained before that in the pamphlet, when you correct
errors, modify or add, you should leave the old code as not used chunk
and add the new code explaining how it improves the old code, and it
serves like Gaby said to keep a history of the changes.

I really hate to enter this debate because, apparently I'm at the
center of it. But there has been a policy of authorship and credit
in Axiom, although I probably never stated it clearly in one place.



I've held forth on the subject of authorship and/or credit in
Axiom before, for instance,

<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-08/msg00058.html>



Being a second-string academic all my life I've had a great deal
of experience with the topic, not all good.

I spent 19 years at IBM Research where "credit" is the coin of the
realm, so to speak. I remember spending years on a project, having
written a reasonable portion of the software, most of the tools, and a
large portion of a user's guide with 3 other people. The copy of the
guide I still have has 4 names on the cover. The DAY after I left the
project the guide was changed to exclude my name. I have a copy of the
"new" guide which is character-by-character the same except for my
name on the cover. 

I also worked on a patent, which my notes (prior to joining IBM) show
as my idea only to have my name excluded from the patent application.

I also generated an idea, did the background research and wrote the
code to demonstrate the idea but when the paper was written and
submitted my name was nowhere to be found. (Names and identifying
details withheld, despite my policy of "liberal credit sharing" :-) ). 

I spent years on another project which I rewrote in common lisp despite
protest (worse, a reprimand). The final project was shipped as common
lisp. The project generated a couple awards of $20,000 each. My name
was not mentioned in the announcement and I did not see a single
dollar of the cash.

Such events, no matter how well rationalized, always feel wrong.




I joined the scratchpad project and a few years later it was to
be sold. I spent time over several months trying to dig up the name
of everyone associated with the project. I put their name on the
documentation and I added a )credit function to the top level command
line of Axiom. I'm certain you don't know most of these people and
you do not know the roles they played in Axiom's history. 

When Axiom was released as free software and I rewrote it into the
current literate form I originally claimed that the author of every
work was Nicolas Bourbaki, thinking that was a clever reference to
a mythical mathematician. I was later informed that this is an official
society in France and changed every author to "The Axiom Team".

<html://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-08/msg00062.html>

Later the "Axiom Team" idea bothered me as there were files for which
I clearly knew the author(s). Their names should be on the work.
I spent time trying to discover or guess the probable author
of each of the nearly 400 files.

Volume 1, the Tutorial book, includes a page that has the name of
everyone who contributed to Axiom up to that time, as far as I know.

The role is not important, it's the effort that counts. There are
people who are listed as contributors and/or authors where the current
work no longer contains a single line of code or documentation. But
they were the original authors. 

I've just gotten permission to use portions of Joel Moses' work 
as part of the documentation effort I'm doing for integration.
It may be that after reformating/editing/rewriting/rethinking
the whole effort there may not be a single line of text that
comes from his original contribution. Yet clearly Joel will be
listed as an author. Authorship is ideas as well as text. And
it is important. So important, in fact, that credit was the ONLY
request made in exchange for his generous contribution.

When considering the issue of authorship and credit ask yourself what
happens when, in 30 years, Axiom contains not a single line of code or
text that you wrote. Are you still an author? Should you still be in
the credit list? Is it meaningful for co-authorship to exist between
people who are 30 years apart in time? Does it hurt to share
authorship or credit? Is ``diff'' the golden standard?

As a matter of (my) policy it has been the case that the most liberal
guidelines were used for authorship and credit. I believe this tradition
should continue.

Francois,

Thank you for testing this.

I have been able to reproduce this problem. The same thing
happens to me. I am looking into the problem and I will let
you know a solution soon.

Regards,
Bill Page.

What version of Sage did you download? As far as I can see the
most recent version of Sage (version 2.0) is "only" about 88 Mb.

http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/dist/src/index.html

or

http://sage.scipy.org/sage/dist/src/index.html

I just finished downloading, untar and make of Sage-2.0 on a
OpenSuSE 10.2 linux system.

On my system I have Axiom built from a recent version of the
build-improvements branch.

Make sure to press Shift+Enter to execute the contents of
the bluebox.

I have very similar problems. But if I only enter Sage
commands, everything seems to work. If I try Axiom commands
then it fails. I see an error traceback in the Sage session
log. These same commands work properly on the Sage server
which is apparently running the same version of Sage but a
different version of Axiom.

Use Shift+Enter to execute a cell.

I think you are doing everything correct. There seems to be
some problem with Sage and/or Axiom. I recall that I had some
problem with readline when I first tested this and I am quite
sure that the 'axiom4sage-0.1.spkg' that is used on the Sage
server was built using gcl with readline disabled. I will
check this and get back to you.

I distinguish authorship and credit: calculus texbooks develop build
on ideas of Newton and Leibnitz (and many have structure similar to
19-century French texts) -- they acknowledge the intelectual acnestors,
but the authors of previous works are not authors of new ones.

Diff is not "the golden standard": it can be easily fooled by reformatting
or trivial changes, IMHO it is importat if structure of original work
remains (translation into another language may change every word, but
preserves structure).

I think that authors should be comfortable with the idea that work
that at one time was useful/important gets replaced by newer works.
If part that I wrote  is replaced by something new I am no longer
author of the new part, when the whole work changes enough I am no
longer author of the new work.  That does not diminsh credit for past
work.  In the mailing list archive (close to the links you gave)
I found the following passage written by Matt Kaufmann:

----
The Boyer-Moore theorem prover, also called Nqthm, is indeed a product of Bob
Boyer and J Moore.  ACL2 is authored by me (Matt Kaufmann) and J Moore, albeit
with significant early contributions from Boyer, who however is no longer
involved (by his choice).
----

So now authors of ACL2 are Kaufmann and Moore, while Boyer contribution
is acknowledged, but he is no longer considered as an author -- that
looks right for me.

I wrote (in response to Gaby, cc-ed to you):

Tim, you have indirectly answered my question.  But I have to 
ask you explicitly:  Do you agree to have your name in \author
field (as opposed to being mentioned in credits/acknowledments
section) of the asq.c.pamplet file commited to wh-sandbox
branch.  If you want to know more about this file I described
how this file took current shape in:

Do you want just setq part (this is one-liner) below, or do you
also want nicely printed databases?  Database part needs my older
change '*do-not-compress-databases*' variable and would brake asq
(asq in wh-sandbox tolerates uncompressed/prettyprinted databases).

Well, I've been reasonably clear about what I believe the Axiom
policy should be and my opinion of what is a reasonable course.

Since I do all merges by hand, when I got to the line that does
the \author merge I would jointly list the authorship of all of
the prior people with all of the new people, quite independent
of the fact that my name is involved.

You chose to "modify" the file rather than replace the file
so in the main line merge I'd have over-ridden your choice
of \author line and changed it to read (in alphabetical order):

\author{Timothy Daly and Waldek Hebisch}

If you, or anyone feels, that they should have sole authorship
the simple solution is to create a new source filename and then 
modify the build script to drop the old file and use the new one.
The build script could compile "newasq.pamphlet" into the bin/asq
function and all would still work. When merging the new file the
issue would not arise and the new file would retain sole authorship.

I have no feelings either way about asq. Indeed, I hadn't noticed
anything until it was mentioned. I do my best not to "own" programs or
keep emotional attachments to them, both of which tend to cause friction
in the open source model.

Hello,

Can someone send me the generated output of the input file
series2.input, which is in src/input ? I have a problem with GCL, so I
tested under Windows where this problem doesn't seem present but I need
to be sure of these results. 

Thanks,

Greg

AFAICS this is bug 312 in action.  This bug appeared as a byproduct
of fix for bug 63.  Igor Khavkine found the wrong place and proposed
a fix, wh-sandbox contains slightly different fix.

Yes you're right, my version of Gold contains the Igor Kahvkine's patch.
Will look in your patches (on my BIG TODO list).

Can any one tell me how to increase the space? Exactly how
big is one page? I have 2GB RAM. Is it possible to allocate
the max to Axiom (under Windows XP)?

Thanks.

Let me add that on my system, the XP OS normally used 
about under 800 MB with multiple programs open. When Axiom 
started the CPU monitor shows 770MB and when the command 
psolve(amat) started, the memory usage rose all the way to 
about 1.20 GB and then quit. So there is plenty of 
physical RAM left (not to mention virtual RAM). I repeated 
this and Axiom aborted with:

    >> System error:
    The storage for CONS is exhausted.
Currently, 97956 pages are allocated.
Use ALLOCATE to expand the space.

Have you tried to follow the advice:

)lisp (allocate 'cons 200000 t)

(Or some bigger number instead of 200000).  Using gcl 2.6.7 I can
maximally give 110000 (120000 is refused, few numbers between crashed
gcl).  Using gcl 2.6.8 I can give bigger values.  Typically page 
means 4 kilobytes, that would agree with process size (empty Axiom
about 80 Mb, around 900 Mb after allocating 200000 pages).

4096 bytes (1 << 12)=20

)lis (room) will tell you the number of page availables. This is fixed
at compile time so if you have compiled with the default options you'll
be limited to 512Mo (and I don't know exactly the memory organisation,
Camm could tell you, but you'll not be able I think to allocate all the
space for cons since there are contiguous pages, relocatable pages ...).

You can use the function allocate:

-- Function: ALLOCATE (type number &optional (really-allocate nil))
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Sets the maximum number of pages for the type class
     of the GCL implementation type TYPE to NUMBER.  If REALLY-ALLOCATE
     is given a non-NIL value, then the specified number of pages will
     be allocated immediately.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Random documentation (under LGPL I think):


-- Variable: *IGNORE-MAXIMUM-PAGES*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Tells the GCL memory manager whether
     (non-NIL) or not (NIL) it should expand memory whenever the
     maximum allocatable pages have been used up.


-- Variable: *OPTIMIZE-MAXIMUM-PAGES*
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Tells the GCL memory manager whether to attempt to
     adjust the maximum allowable pages for each type to approximately
     optimize the garbage collection load in the current process.
     Defaults to T.  Set to NIL if you care more about memory usage
     than runtime.

-- Function: GBC (x)
     Package:LISP

     GCL specific: Invokes the garbage collector (GC) with the
     collection level specified by X.  NIL as the argument causes GC to
     collect cells only.  T as the argument causes GC to collect
     everything.

-- Function: MAXIMUM-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the current maximum number of pages for
     contiguous blocks.


-- Function: GET-HOLE-SIZE ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns as a fixnum the size of the memory hole (in
     pages).

-- Function: ALLOCATE-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES (number &optional
          (really-allocate nil))
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Sets the maximum number of pages for contiguous
     blocks to NUMBER.  If REALLY-ALLOCATE is non-NIL, then the
     specified number of pages will be allocated immediately.

-- Function: MAXIMUM-ALLOCATABLE-PAGES (type)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the current maximum number of pages for the
     type class of the GCL implementation type TYPE.

-- Function: ALLOCATED-RELOCATABLE-PAGES ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the number of pages currently allocated for
     relocatable blocks.

-- Function: MAXIMUM-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns the current maximum number of pages for
     contiguous blocks.


-- Function: GET-HOLE-SIZE ()
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Returns as a fixnum the size of the memory hole (in
     pages).

-- Function: SET-HOLE-SIZE (fixnum)
     Package:SI

     GCL specific: Sets the size of the memory hole (in pages).

-- Funcition: ALLOCATED (type)
     Package:SI

     Returns 6 values:
    nfree
          number free

    npages
          number of pages

    maxpage
          number of pages to grow to

    nppage
          number per page

    gbccount
          number of gc's due to running out of items of this size

    nused
          number of items used

     Note that all items of the same size are stored on similar pages.
     Thus for example on a 486 under linux the following basic types are
     all the same size and so will share the same allocated information:
     CONS BIGNUM RATIO COMPLEX STRUCTURE.

-- Variable: *LISP-MAXPAGES*
     Package:SI GCL specific: Holds the maximum number of pages (1 page
     =3D 2048 bytes) for the GCL process.  The result of changing the
     value of SI:*LISP-MAXPAGES* is unpredictable.

-- Variable: *MULTIPLY-STACKS*
     Package:SI

     If this variable is set to a positive fixnum, then the next time
     through the TOP-LEVEL loop, the loop will be exited.  The size of
     the stacks will be multiplied by the value of *multiply-stacks*,
     and the TOP-LEVEL will be called again.  Thus to double the size
     of the stacks:

     >(setq si::*multiply-stacks* 2) [exits top level and reinvokes it,
     with the new stacks in place] >

     We must exit TOP-LEVEL, because it and any other lisp functions
     maintain many pointers into the stacks, which would be incorrect
     when the stacks have been moved.    Interrupting the process of
     growing the stacks, can leave you in an inconsistent state.


-- Function: ALLOCATE-GROWTH (type min max percent percent-free)
     Package:SI

     The next time after a garbage collection for TYPE, if PERCENT-FREE
     of the objects of this TYPE are not actually free, and if the
     maximum number of pages for this type has already been allocated,
     then the maximum number will be increased by PERCENT of the old
     maximum, subject to the condition that this increment be at least
     MIN pages and at most MAX pages.  A list of the previous values
     for min, max, percent, and percent-free for the type TYPE is
     returned.   A value of 0 means use the system default,  and if an
     argument is out of range then the current values are returned with
     no change made.

     Examples: (si::allocate-growth 'cons 1 10 50 10) would insist that
     after a garbage collection for cons, there be at least 10% cons's
     free.   If not the number of cons pages would be grown by 50% or
     10 pages which ever was smaller.   This might be reasonable if you
     were trying to build an image which was `full', ie had few free
     objects of this type.

     (si::allocate-growth 'fixnum 0 10000 30 40) would grow space till
     there were normally 40% free fixnums, usually growing by 30% per
     time.

     (si::allocate-growth 'cons 0 0 0 40) would require 40% free conses
     after garbage collection for conses, and would use system defaults
     for the the rate to grow towards this goal.

     (si::allocate-growth 'cons -1 0 0 0) would return the current
     values, but not make any changes.

Thanks, Waldek. I tried as you suggested; the allocate produces a system
error unless I use a very small number. Nonetheless, the CONS type space
seems to have 200000 even though there is an error message.

However, when I run the computation, it stops again. So I am not sure if
I got any extra space that way (the max page is still the same) or it is
some other type of memory that needs to be increased.  I am limited to
131072 pages (using (room), as suggested by Gregory Vanuxem -- Greg,
thanks for the docs). So it looks like 512MB. I am using a precompiled
version on Windows. I have no idea what gcl I am using.

I also tried the commands from SI but the run always quit after using up
the pages (but there is still plenty of physical memory).

It's 5 a.m.  on a sunday morning and I can't sleep because I'm
suffering from flaming asshole syndrome. The person suffering from
this disease feels they know what they are talking about and needs to
enlighten the rest of the world. Today I've got it bad.

I've been programming for nearly 36 years. I'm obsessive about it. I'm
writing a program for work that translates bit streams into mathematics
(in lisp). And for a hobby, I write Axiom programs that translate
mathematics into bit streams (in lisp). When I leave work (whatever
that means, since I work from home and have no fixed hours) I swap
machines and work on Axiom. When I'm not programming, I'm reading
about programming. Of course, I don't read programs, which in some
sense makes me illiterate in my own field. But I do write them. And I
do think about how and why I write them. And how to do it right.
Especially when it concerns Axiom.




In the last 6 years I've given a lot of thought to Axiom. Where can it
go? What can it do? Will it survive? Is it worth keeping? Can people
depend on it?

Ah, that's the question for today...."Can people depend on it?".

And if they can't know the results are correct, what's the point?



I'm re-reading the Mythical Man-Month, which I do every couple years.
And I've recently read "Dreaming in Code", a book about constructing
Chandler, an open-source Personal Information Manager. I watched a
video of destructive testing of the new Boeing aircraft wing. And I'm
remembering Bill Perzley, a guy I used to work for who knew what it
meant to write quality software.

I'll take each of these unrelated components and try to tie them
together.

If you haven't read the Mythical Man-Month I cannot recommend it
enough. It brings up so many good points, like the tarpit problem,
that you need to be able to recognize. Among the many points he makes,
one key "take-away" lesson stands out for me. "Nobody knows how to
schedule software". NOBODY. Even Knuth admits it. So next time your
boss asks you for a schedule don't give him one. Because you don't
know. You can't even guess. Another take-away lesson is that
programming is a lot more than writing code. And that's what concerns
us here. More about this later.




The "Dreaming in Code" book is about a paid project pretending to be
an open source project. It is never going to complete. And it will
fail to do anything worth doing. And no-one can learn from or build
upon the results, good or bad.  It's another long, drawn out software
disaster. I've been there and I've done that. I've written whole
shelves worth of software. Some of it died because the robots that it
drove no longer exist. Some of it died because the company no longer
exists. Some of it died because .... well, because it was crap code,
which nobody but me understood and nobody could maintain. More about
this later.





Which brings me to my third reference point, the destructive testing
of Boeing's new aircraft wing. The video is on youtube and it's really
impressive to watch. The engineering team, dozens of people, is
standing around watching the bending of the wings of a brand new
Boeing aircraft until they snap. The design spec calls for surviving
150 percent of the design load. Both wings finally broke, exactly in
the wing location expected with exactly the kind of failure they
expected.... at 154% of design load. The engineering team went wild
with joy. Except for one guy. He was clearly annoyed and when asked
why he said that they were wrong by about 2.7 percent. (That's the
kind of engineer I want designing airplanes I fly.) Think about that
test. They busted up a perfectly good, multimillion dollar airplane to
test it. And they knew the answer to the test before they ran it.  You
could look up the analysis, read the documentation and rely on the
answer before they ran the test.




Which brings me to my last reference point, Bill Perzley. When I first
started working in robotics I worked on a 3 man research team. Bill
was an old man, in his mid 50s (:-) ) and was the research lead. We
had a robot that could move 200kg at several hundred inches per second
and stop within 1 encoder bit of the target location repeatably. This
was a very big, very fast, and when you made a programming mistake, a
very dangerous machine. The robot had 6 different joints and 16
kilobytes of plated-wire memory. That's 131072 bits. 

We had to teach the robot how to weld the fender of a car using a 30kg
spot welding gun while the fender was stationary. Then we had to
convert the stationary points into moving points so the robot would
weld the fender as it slid by on the assembly line. During our initial
testing a single bit value caused the robot to reach upward while the
weld gun was inside the fender. The robot lifted the weld gun, the
fender, the iron trolley, and 6 meters of steel I-beam up to the
ceiling before we could even think to hit the emergency stop button.
Fast, obedient, and dangerous.

So, Bill spends 4 MONTHS in his office smoking cigars like they were
free, banging away on a 4 function hand calculator. After 4 months he
comes out with a huge pile of A4 paper covered in zeros and ones,
131072 of them to be exact. He hands them to me, along with a pile of
mathematics. He asked me to check it over. And when I'm done to use our
memory store interface (a set of switches to choose a memory location,
set its value, and toggle a "write") to "program" the robot. He had
worked out the final location of every weld as it would appear while
the fender moved past the robot. If his calculations were correct the
robot should spot weld the fender in 24 places in real time
coordinated with the varying speed of the cart along the I-beam.

He had me "program" all 131072 bits into the robot so we could run
this test case. He wanted to see the exact results of his test and the
only way to do that was to stick his head into the wheel well of the
fender, inches from the robot and WELL within the robot's
reach. Needless to say, I was a bit nervous as a single bit mistake in
keying in the "program" could kill Bill before anybody could react.
Being the engineer that he was he stuck his head in the wheel well and
told me to start the robot. I argued with him.... 

ME:   Bill, if this is wrong it could kill you.
BILL: It's right
ME:   Bill, how do you know you didn't make a mistake?"
BILL: I checked it.
ME:   Suppose the math is wrong?
BILL: Did you check it?
ME:   Yes.

ME:   Suppose I made a mistake keying in the program.
BILL: Did you check it?
ME:   Several times.
BILL: Good. Then it works. Start the robot.

I watched the robot swing a weld gun within inches of his cigar all
along the 6 meters. And it worked, just exactly as Bill said it would.
And he KNEW it would work. Why? Because everything he did was
absolutely the best he could make it. This test, like the Boeing wing
test, was a foregone conclusion. He knew the answer before he ever
gave me the program. And I understood everything he did because he
wrote it all down in detail. You could bet your life on the result.



Now, what's this all got to do with Axiom?

Ah, that's the question for today...."Can people depend on it?".

And if they can't know the results are correct, what's the point?


I believe that Axiom could be the foundation for the next few hundred
years of computational mathematics. Oh, not the program we have
now. But the one it could evolve into if we do it right. Axiom is the
only program I've ever worked on that has that potential. The
mathematics doesn't change and, if correctly implemented, Axiom should
always give you an answer you can depend on. In fact, you should be
able to look at the final result of an Axiom computation and KNOW it
is right. And after that time, you and everyone else can depend on it.
Like an aircraft wing, only better because this is mathematics.

But I also find it frustrating because I don't see any Bill Perzley's
in the game. Bill not only learned the mathematics (we both took the
same course from Lou Paul), he understood it. He "programmed" it (we
didn't have anything but calculators and switches for programming but
it was still programming). He wrote it up so *I* could understand it.
And when he wrote programs they worked and *I* could check them. You
could bet your life on his work. And Bill often did.

Is this the level of quality we see in Axiom? Nope. Is this the level
of quality we can achieve? Yes. So, why don't we achieve it? Why don't
we write Axiom software as if our life depended on it? Why are we
still writing software like the Chandler project? Why can't we say
that this WILL work and it WILL give you the correct answer? What does
it take to get Perzley kind of quality?



After much thought I believe that we need to deeply improve the way
Axiom is written. Consider the latest dust-up that just flew by on the
mailing list (this isn't intended to cast blame, just to illustrate).

The issue is an apparent bug that was in the original Axiom
code. Apparently the computation of:

  f:=taylor(1-x^2)
  sin asin f

gave a wrong answer. A "fix" was applied that gives the answer:

  1 - x^2 + O(x^11)

This was considered wrong and a new "fix" was applied giving the
answer:

 1 - 1/4 x^4 - 1/16 x^6 - 7/768 x^8 - 5/3072 x^10 + O(x^11)


Lets apply Bill Perzley's eyes to this bug. I don't know if the
original Axiom answer was correct, the first "fix" was correct, or the
latest "fix" was correct. That's a problem. And it's a very deep
problem. Much deeper than this one bug. Bill's approach to this would
be to start at the bottom, namely subtraction in (1-x^2) and work his
way up, understanding all he could about each piece. At the end of
several months he's announce the fix. And I'd be willing to bet my
life he was right. Because he understood the problem, he understood
the answer, and he documented it so *I* could understand it.

How hard is this? Really, really hard. Because almost nobody knows
about subtraction in Axiom. Nonsense? Well subtraction is a very
widely implemented operator in many domains such as quaternions.  It
occurs everywhere. Is the definition right? Does it work everywhere?
Does axiom implement subtraction properly for all domains?  Once we
feel confident of that we can look at the "1" portion of the initial
expression. What does "1" mean in Axiom? Does it properly implement
the concept of "1" in mathematics?  Can we depend on it?




So that's one of the key questions. "Can we depend on it?". We may be
a domain experts in robotics and implement DHMatrices in Axiom. But did
we write it up in depth so the next person can understand it? 

By the time we've reached the level of documentation of things like
 
  UnivariateTaylorSeries(Expression Integer,x,0)

we, and everyone who reads our documentation, should be able to say
with life-depending certainty that our answer is correct. Someone 30
years from now should be able to read what we wrote and be as certain
as we are that our answer is correct.



Because we're doing mathematics.
Because we're doing it for people to understand.
Because Axiom's life depends on it.

Tim

Dear Tim,

I agree with many things you write, save two:

1) I think that it is not worth dying for some robot or mathematics or
   anything.  And it is certainly not the case that you can rely ("depend") on
   anything.  I'd say, that both Bill and Boing team were just lucky.

   Important note: I do believe that various efforts and tools can improve on
   the likelihood of success, literate programming, unit testing are certainly
   two of them (the latter still missing in Axiom, because nobody finds the
   time to make AldorUnit work with libaxiom. Should be quite trivial, though).

   But it won't help you if you "died", even if the probability of dying was
   very very very low.

2) The history

does not seem entirely correct to me. Since I believe that you have some
versions of axiom around, could you please double check?

In any case, Ralf Hemmecke has (in the framework of our species project) a well
documented and unit-tested powerseries implementation, albeit only a partial
implementation, currently. Looking at the code of Axiom, I'm quite convinced
that *all* of it should go away. It can be done much better, if you look at
Joris van der Hoeven's and Dominik Gruntz papers.

(On Computing Limits in a Symbolic Manipulation System; Dominik Gruntz. ETH
 Diss 11432, 1996. http://www.gruntz.ch/publications2.html)

By the way, I think that most code in axiom is crap. It is a mere coincidence
that it works roughly. If you want to see a well engineered system, look at the
MuPAD sources. (I'm not saying that it couldn't be done better. But it's quite
incredible how well it works. It's a pity that MuPAD is non-free now.)


Martin

PS: does anybody happen to know how many initial values one needs to single out
a specific Taylor series solution of an algebraic equation? To get a feel for
the problem:

There need not be a Taylor solution at all:

f(x)^2-x=0

There can be several branches with equal constant term:

 map(e+->series(e, x=0), zerosOf((x^2-1)*z^2-2*(x^4-1)*z+(x^2-1),z))

                             +-+                              +-+
                +-+     2   \|2   3      4       +-+     2   \|2   3      4
   (160)  [1 - \|2 x + x  - ---- x  + O(x ),1 + \|2 x + x  + ---- x  + O(x )]
                              4                                4


I'd guess that the first d terms are enough, when the equation has degree d in
z, but I don't know and in general less should be sufficient.

Some problem for ADE's, i.e., equations of the form

p(1, z(x), z'(x), z''(x), ...) = 0, p polynomial with coefficients in K[x]?

That combination of questions might be the most common objection I have
heard to using CAS software in science and mathematical research.  One
I happen to agree with. Oh, there are others, such as the tendency of
lazy humans to substitute computer software for understanding, and that
has its valid points, but the most serious one I think is being able to
know the results are correct.

This is why I think it is important to pursue proof checkers (things
like Isabelle, HOL, COQ, ACL2, etc.) as a starting point, not as
something to tack on later.  KNOWING a result is correct when a
computer produces it is very very complex.  It is unambiguous when a
wing breaks, and fairly easy to measure (given the right equipment). 
Predicting it is fairly hard, but doable.  Ditto for the robot - if
something goes wrong, lots of equipment starts flying that shouldn't be
moving.  Or, in the less spectacular case, the wrong thing gets welded.
 A computer has many subtle points of possible failure.  Is it a weird
CPU bug, a mishandling of information in some subtle, unexpected way, a
1/1,000,000,000 failure condition of the operating system (think the
blackout that hit most of the northeastern US a while back - they
traced that back to a software error condition with a very small
window: http://www.securityfocus.com/news/8412)  If the systems running
such a major portion of the national energy grid can't be completely
trusted, why should anyone trust CAS software?

In this instance, it sounds like both the hardware and software were
special purpose, very well engineered, and he had a fair amount of
time/money to commit to the project.  While authors of CAS systems
might be able to make sure the software they write is solid (although
that goal still seems a ways off) they must rely on both the operating
environment and the hardware underneath it to work correctly.  Neither
of those components is under the control of the author, since the
software will be installed in as many environments as it can be made to
run.  It will work most of the time, but who knows when some subtle
difference will trigger a northeast blackout in the results?  How can
it be prevented?

Because, among other reasons, we don't have the tools that will let us
make that assertion and back it up.  I doubt Perzley would have been
willing to do what he did if the robot was being operated by Windows XP
and was just taking instructions he had fed it - I know I sure wouldn't
- because every element of the system which MIGHT cause failure isn't
guaranteed.

> What does it take to get Perzley kind of quality?

This is the type of problem I would like to do research in, someday.  I
have a ways to go first (as you mentioned earlier, you must know both
the mathematics and how to program, and I am working on increasing my
basic knowledge before making another run at Axiom level problems) but
the question is a worthy one.

Science magazine had a rather interesting article (I suppose it's not
the full story since it's a specialty topic in a general magazine, but
I found it good food for thought) about the difficulties that have
begun to appear in the form of proofs that cannot be checked by human
reviewers: 
http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/307/5714/1402a   In that
article, the point was made that there are two aspects to proof
checking:

1.  Knowing it is correct
2.  Understanding why it is correct (human understanding)

If you only use human beings to check proofs, these two components are
not separable.  A human being must understand the proof in order to
know if it is correct.  An automated proof checker, correctly done,
should be able to mechanically verify that the proof is sound.  In
theory, a human being dogged enough to follow the computer through the
steps should arrive at the exact same conclusion, although the
experience is unlikely to build much insight into how to make "good"
proofs.  What needs to be human understandable is a) the proof checking
system and b) the logic converting human CAS style inputs into proof
statements.  Once the correct proof statements are generated, the proof
checker will take it from there.

I think the distinction is important for what we are trying to do here,
because for a CAS it is less important to produce elegant/beautiful
proofs and more important to know the result is correct.  Proof
software may never generate the "optimal" proof for a given result, but
so long as it generates a CORRECT proof that can be evaluated in
reasonable time it has done what is needed for us to rely on it.  In
our case the proofs are a means to an end - if people can rely on
Axiom's results as having come from components that have proof backing,
and can at need (say for a particularly critical result for a paper)
have Axiom generate the full proof validation for a result to be
verified by any of several systems, I think we will have achieved a
level of confidence that will permit more general use of the systems. 
We will be able to say "yes it is correct, and here's the proof, to be
checked however you care to check it."

Now the details of that system, and whether it is even possible, are
the subject of many years of fascinating research and may even require
defining as unambiguously as possible what it means to prove something.
 But I think this is going to be essential for the long term viability
of any such system - it must be "so good" that using anything else
becomes a liability.

CAS systems are currently used in science - Mathematica + Feyncalc was
a common tool at my undergrad physics department - and those systems
have become usable through a sort of prolonged process of evaluation by
many scientists.  However, if asked to show proof that a feyncalc
derived result was correct, pencil and paper work would be needed to
verify the system was correct.  Making a system that WOULDN'T need such
work is going to be a hard sell, and some good answers to the question
of why any new system is any better than Mathematica + Feyncalc would
be needed.

But to make that system, one must know not just programming and
mathematics but proof logic as well (plus high energy physics, for this
problem domain), and how to make all of them interact.    Which reminds
me, I have some reading to do...

Cheers,
CY

Dear Bill,

unfortunately, it seems that mathaction is currently down.

furthermore, it seems that the mirror at risc is not really up to date. By the
way, if I make changes at the mirror at risc, I guess they are not applied to
the main site, are they? I.e., after one update, they get lost?

Thanks,

Martin

I am looking at the problem. Something has gone with the configuration
of Apache on the axiom-developer.org server however I have not made
any recent changes. The backend Zope web server however is still working.
So in the mean time you can bypass Apache by accessing the Axiom wiki
site from the following url:

http://axiom-developer.org:8080/mathaction/FrontPage

I will let you know when the problem with Apache is fixed.

It is true that the risc mirror site is not up to date. I have
not gotten around to update for over a month. Changes you make
at the risc site are not automatically applied at the main site
but there is a simple process to transfer pages from one site
to another.

Bill Page.

Ok, problem solved.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

and

http://portal.axiom-developer.org

are working again. The problem was that one of the user directories
on axiom-developer.org was deleted without removing the entries
for that user's web site from the apache configuration files. Apache
refused to restart.

Tim has been making an effort to clean up the file space on
axiom-developer.org in order to reduce the monthly cost of operating
this server (Over $250/month which Tim is contributing from his own
pocket! I think we need to discuss how to share the cost of this
server.) On his request I recently cleaned up the mathaction development
directories but I am quite sure that I did not delete any /home user
directories.

Anyway, the Apache configuration file has now been updated and
everything appears to be fine again.

I will now put some priority on updating the risc mirror site in
case this or something more serious happens again.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Definitively. I'll keep it in mind.

Dear Waldek,

is there a way to turn of messages like

BasicLookup coerce: ((OutputForm) $)
Lookup coerce ((OutputForm) $)
Lookup coerce ((OutputForm) $)
BasicLookup coerce: ((OutputForm) $)
Lookup coerce ((OutputForm) $)

in wh-sandbox?

thanks,

Martin

Waldek, et al.

I just tried to build wh-sandbox on a SuSE 10.2 linux system. Everything se=
ems
to compile normally up to the point of building hyperdoc and ends with the =
error
message:

  No rule to make target `all-ax'.

Does anyone have an idea about what might cause this error?  Suggestions?

What reports do we have of successful builds of wh-sandbox? What
platforms?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I just re-built wh-sandbox, although not from scratch but only after a svn up,
on kubuntu dapper without a problem.

Thanks for the report.  I build regularly on prerelase Debian and on
Mandrake 9.2.  Your log looks different than my build log -- I will
investigate what is the reason for the difference.

When do you see them?  They look like debugging messages I use, but
they should not get into public version.  ATM I do not not them,
and quick search did not found them in current svn.

Later you wrote:

Do the messages appear in the freshly re-built version?

yes. Unfortunately, I have thrown the log away. Ah, I see, I just ran a svn
diff and some files are modified. Very likely, this is because of an
experimental patch of Peter Broadbery to enable aldor extend. Sorry about
taking away your time...

I am not sure if I can fix anything, but you are right that
MantepseSpad2 did not compile in the 1 minute CPU time limit
on MathAction. I increased the limit to 60 minutes - in fact
the compile took almost 12 minutes of CPU time! That is one
long hard program to compile!!!

Maybe it is alright now? It seems to have compiled. You have
to wait for about 15 minutes. The browser times out and does
not display the result but when you refresh the page after 15
minutes the compile is complete and the page looks ok.

Let me know if this works now. I will leave the limit at 60
minutes for now.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes, it is quite big. Even though I factored out many many things already...

> Maybe it is alright now? It seems to have compiled. 

Unfortunately, no. In fact, if you unfold the spad button, it says

  >> System error:
  Unexpected end of #<input stream "/var/zope/var/LatexWiki/GUESS.NRLIB/index.KAF">.

I have never seen such a message before... Well, I'm trying again and see
whether it's a one time only. However, I have to go to bed then, it's alreade
10 past 4...


Thanks for all your help!

Martin

PS: Neil Sloane will be looking at the program next week, and possibly include
it in SuperSeeker. That'd be nice!

While testing Hyperdoc in the current version wh-sandbox on OpenSuSE 10.2 I
encountered the following problem while run some example graphics:

Hyperdoc processed crashed (window disappeared) and the following message
appeared in the Axiom console session:

(2) -> XIO:  fatal IO error 104 (Connection reset by peer) on X server ":0.0"
      after 40603 requests (40235 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
read_pixmap_file: unable to open
/home/wspage/axiom-sandbox/target/i686-suse-linux/share/viewports/AssortedGraphicsExamplePage6.VIEW/image.xpm
uncompress: No such file or directory

-------

My understanding is that 'uncompress' is an obselete name for 'gzip -d'. Is that
correct?

Regards,
Bill Page.

After investigating this a little more I found that the file

   src/hyper/Makefile

in my out-of-source build directory was incomplete. It seemed
to contain only the standard header stanzas but none of the
contents of

   src/hyper/Makefile.in

from the source directory.

I do not know the exact cause, however after re-running configure
in the build directory the problem was corrected and I was able to
complete the build by simply re-starting 'make'.

The only difference that I am aware of between the first time I
ran 'configure' and the second time was that previously I had
not yet installed 'latex'. I am not sure if this might have triggered
the problem.

In any case, I can now report a successful build on OpenSuSE 10.2.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I don't know.  But, it is curious.  I've seen a similar behaviour in
build-improvement once, but it happened at the toplevel.  At the time,
I found that it was because noweave/notangle was missing so the
build-setup.sh script overwrote complete information with partial
information.

I would like to share with you recent progress I made.  Namely, I was
able to bootstrap Axiom algebra using no cached Lisp (that means no
Lisp for algebra files, boot and interpreter are different story).

How doeas it work?  I looked once again at 'Loading' messages appearing
in Axiom trace.  I have noticed that only 263 different thing get
leaded.  Of them there is 199 categories, 44 domains associated
with categories (those domains give default implementations for
some functions) and 20 core domains:

AssociationList Boolean Character DoubleFloat Fraction
IndexedList IndexedOneDimensionalArray IndexedString
IndexedVector Integer List NonNegativeInteger OutputForm
PositiveInteger PrimitiveArray Reference SingleInteger
String Symbol Vector

Main bootstrap problems are due to core domains: if we forget about
Reference the other are all mutually dependent.  Also, they depend
on many categories and it turn many categories depend on core
domains.

AFAICS bootstrap layer used by Tim includes almast all core domains
and categories with associated domains.  Once we have compiled
all categories and domains loaded by Axiom we can proceed essentially
in any order.

I spent some time trying to find pattern deciding wether a file
gets loaded during given compilation or not.  There are obvious
reasons to load categories:  Axiom implements Join as runtime
operation, so in order to compute Join it must first load all
categories involved in Join.  Also, it seems that Axiom loads
categories of arguments of constructors.  However, loading of
domains looked almost random.  After some effort I have tracked
this to the optDeltaEntry in nruncomp.boot.pamphlet: appearently
this functions tries to avoid lookups in domain vectors and redirect
calls to final destination.  To do this optDeltaEntry must have
domain vectors available, so it load corresponding domains.
After disabling optimisation done by optDeltaEntry _no_ domains
are loaded during compilarion.

So, it remains to bootstrap categories.  There is still a little
cyclic dependencies between categories, due to constructor
arguments.  But $bootStrapMode switch resolves this dependency,
and it is enough to topologically sort categories based on
ancestor fields.


The final process looks as follows.  The compiler is modified to
have extra switch $bootstrapDomains, which if set to true disables
optimisation in optDeltaEntry.  In the first pass I use topologically
sorted list of categories and compile in $bootStrapMode.  In the
second pass I use $bootstrapDomains switch and compile categories
plus core domains.  In the thired pass I recompile categories
and core domains in normal mode.  Finally, I compile the rest
of algebra in alphabetical order (in fact, I let make choose the
oreder, but the list I give is sorted alphabetically, and make
processes it in order).

There is still problem of databases: the process I outlined above
uses pre-built databases.  Most of the typechecking uses information
form databases, so in order to modify algebra one has to generate
databases first and only later can use bootstrap procedure.  I made
some progress trying to bootstrap with empty databases.  I am able
to compile categories and about 50 domains in $bootStrapMode starting
from empty databases, but the resulting databases still contain too
little (or possibly incorrect) information, so normal bootstrap using
such databases fails relatively early.

I think we need to have a basic interpreter, and a basic compiler
in the sense that they are almost like the interpreter and compiler,
but they "know" only 

   * simple types: Boolean, Integer, Float
   * constructed types: List(T), Vector(T)
   * fundamental structure: Category

Form that, we must separate and rationalize the database construction.

We must also be able to process a file without first having to split
it into several chunks.  We have been able to process SPAD files that
way; making )abbrev a no-op.

Not exactly, 'uncompress' the program to decompress .Z (LZW compressed)
files.  Later 'gzip' was created and to large degree reduced need to
use 'compress' and 'uncompress'.  And yes, 'gzip -d' can do the job
of 'uncompress' (and more).

I have met similar (or maybe exactly this) problem.  'uncompress'
program is uses by Xpm library -- to see any images at all you
must have 'uncompress' program (shell script passing work to 'gzip -d'
may serve as a replacement).  But on some machines there are problems
even if 'uncompress' is present.  In fact on dual core Pentums running
Debian prerelease most of the time I get error trying to see images
(but sometimes images work).  I have traced my problem to Xpm library
-- it looked that 'uncompress' was nicely decompressing images,
but for unknown reasons Xpm library decided that 'uncompress' was
not working and returned error indication.  I am not sure where the
real error is: it may be bug in this version of Xpm library, it may
be that Hyperdoc is messing with process control in ways which
confilct with Xpm.  All machines where I was able to reproduce the
problem run the same version of Debian on the same hardware, so it
looked likely that this is a bug in Debian provided Xpm library.

There is a workaroud: in wh-sandbox Hyperdoc will uncompressed files
if they are present (or 'gzip' compressed ones, but AFAIK 'gzip -d'
has the same problem as 'uncompress').  At least in my case reading
uncompressed images never failed.  So you can try uncomressing
all .xpm.Z files (wastefull on space, but should work ...).

In the future we want to replace Xpm library by a different (portable)
image library, so the problem should automatically go away.  If the
problem affects more poeple I will probably look again at it to
find quicker solutuion.

Hello,

I have installed axiom and msys as root in windows xp for some students.
It's all right ! 

But I don't want theses students are root in windows xp.
So I create an other login.

I change rights of the axiom directory and the msys directory.
Now they are read/write/and others for all users.

When I run axiom in this login I get a boot error.
Axiom is looking for a file in a very long path in msys
inside 8 or 10 sub-sub-directory. This file isn't in the msys directory.

This computer is at work and my mail at home... So I can't be more precise.

May you help me ?

Francois M.

msys is not necessary to use Axiom on windows - only if you
need to build Axiom from source.

How did you install Axiom in Windows? From the binary install

It sounds like the AXIOM environment variable is not set.

To check the AXIOM variable go to:

 Start/ControlPanel/System/Advanced/EnvironmentVariables

and check that the 'System variables' table includes

  Variable Name: AXIOM
  Variable Value: c:/Program Files/axiom/mnt/windows

It is possible that Axiom was originally installed for a single
user only, in which case the AXIOM variable may only be defined
for that specific user in the 'Users varaibles for ...'.

Bill Page.

I have commited new algebra bootstrap to wh-sandbox.  This code is
subject to change.  I belive that the code I commited should work
well for the intended purpose (that is bootstraping Axiom),
however:
- I am still investigating bootstrap problems (especially database
  bootstrap) and the whole process is likely to change
- I find the code ugly, partially due to tools used (make nad shell)
  and consider moving it to Lisp
- the code uses hardcoded lists of files, we should generate them
  automatically.

I have commited it so that:
- others can see details of bootstrap process
- I can kill Lisp embedded in algebra pamphlets

Current compiler (before algebra bootstrap) does not know about Integer.
And Integer depends on large part of algebra.  So I would say that such
basic compiler while a noble goal would require substantial algebra
rewrite.  Such rewrite in turn need something like Aldor post facto
extension.

As an excercise I tried to make a minimal algebra.  I compiled
about 20 very simple domains and categories and generated corresponding
databses, but resulting interpreter was non-functional.  More effort
would probably give functional system, but ATM I am not sure if such
system is useful for bootstrap.

In longer run sure.  ATM I am using quite different method: I dumped
parse trees of the whole Axiom algebra into a file.  So now I can load
the whole algebra just as a single S-expression.  I am loading this
S-expression into sbcl running various analyses on it.  The idea is to
write (in Lisp) a simple compiler capable of extracting type declarations
and generating from them Axiom databases.  ATM I have a semi-reasonable
macro expander (there is one macro that the expander misess, but I
hope that it correctly expands all declarations that I need).  I have
also a simple transformer that eliminates 'where' construct.  Together
macro expander + 'where' transformer allow me to separate implementation
form interface (the assumption beeing that in databases we need only
information from interface).

Concerning abbrev declaration: I am not sure how to find out wether
something is a package or a domain without using information from
abbrevs.

I don't think so.  

The internal AST that eventually reaches the type analyzer and the
semantic analyzer, starting from compTopLelve, already contain mention
of Integer (and the other basic types).

| And Integer depends on large part of algebra.  So I would say that such

By "simple type", I don't expect the basic type to understand beyond
simple operations defined on their domains.  

The glorious version of Integer is not needed wholesale when starting
the boostrap process.  The glorification is a set that needs to come
after.  Yes, post facto extensions are ways to achieve late
glorification -- and if you look at the practice, this is not fancy;
just think "type classes" (Haskell), which Axiom would have invented
two decades ago if it had post facto extensions.

Well, Axiom has 25-year horizon; so not sure what you mean by 
"longer run" :-)

What other thing we have been doing, we have found both the parse form
(not the parse tree) and the internal AST useful to save and load later.
A third form, not conveniently present in Axiom at the moment, is one
where either the parse form or the internal AST is completely typed
(just before code generation).

I do sincerely hope, we don't end up multiplying parsers, analyzers,
type checkers, macro expanders, each with its own share of bugs, and
mix all those in form or Axiom!

Now, if you look at a capsule, it tells your whether something "is"
for a domain or not by the presence or absence of 'domain in the
category declaration.  Again look at the the internal AST produced by 
parseTransform.

I'm sorry the whole documentation is not online yet, but many things
are happening and I need to petition for 48h in a day.

Th algebra interface to the parser is very simple minded.  There is
work going on to define different levels of fully typed ASTs.

Try starting with minimal databases.  You will get messages as:

Integer is not a known type

or

Boolean is not a known type

Compiler do have _some_ knowledge: Record, Union, Mapping and
Enumeration are built-in.  There are some more or less random
pieces of information hardcoded in various parts of the compiler.
But Integer, Boolean and List are recognized only if present in
databeses.

Note that already postTransform uses semantic information:

postAtom x ==
  $BOOT => x
  x=0 => '(Zero)
  x=1 => '(One)
  EQ(x,'T) => 'T_$ -- rename T in spad code to T$
  IDENTP x and GETDATABASE(x,'NILADIC) => LIST x
  x
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

and parseTransform (more precisely parseHas) again preforms database
lookup.

I use the following Integer for bootstrap:

)abbrev category INS IntegerNumberSystem
IntegerNumberSystem(): Category == with nil
)abbrev domain INT Integer
Integer: IntegerNumberSystem with
    FakeIdentityToAppeaseSpad: % -> %
  == add
    FakeIdentityToAppeaseSpad(x) == x

This is enough to convince compiler that Integer is a valid type.  I do
not see how better Integer will help in bootstrap.  More precisely to
bootstrap you need to resolve forward references.  And the problem is
that in _last_ bootstrap pass there is a lot of forward references.
I do not think that will help resolve those references.

I guess that you think about something like classic compiler bootstrap,
where you need to get translator for small language running and than
you can use it to translate rest of the compiler.  In particular such
set of basic domains would allow to write large part of compiler in
Spad.  But current bootstrap problem is really all about databases,
we do not care if during database bootstrap we get correct code (or
any code at all), we just want to collect type declaration.  And
we need a lot of declarations in databases to start compiling
current Axiom algebra.

That was just a sanity check of what I did.  All I am saying here is
that my attempt to create small system failed (it does not mean that
other will fail -- I certainly did not try hard and gave up early).

I wrote: parse tree.  More precisely I took output of Meta parser, just
before call to postTransform.  I replaced call to postTransform by
call to a simple flattener (to replace nested trees having semicolon
as operator by lists) and pretty-printed the result of flattener 
(without flattening the expression had too much nesting and
pretty-printer could not print it correctly).

My Lisp code is throw-away code (or research if you prefer such name).
The basic thing is that I am getting better turnaroud with sbcl.  
I can load the algebra tree into sbcl in about half of second (I am
loading it from a fasl).  Tree walk trough this tree takes small part
of second.  If I have large output most of the time is spent pretty-printing
the results, which may take few seconds.  If results are small the
whole run may finish in a second.  I do not see how I could get
such turnaroud working inside Axiom tree.  FYI, Axiom needed about
70 seconds to parse algebra -- I certainly do not want to loose
70 seconds each time I try something.

I do not want to use output of parseTransform because it depends on
databases.  If databases miss some information the resulting tree
is incorrect (sometimes the compiler will later fix such a tree, but
many cases lead to errors).  

I think that currect Axiom apprach to compilation has serious flaw.
Namely postTransform and parseTransform are dane _before_ macro
expansion.  This means that they have only limited syntactic
information and some transformations just work blindly.  Both
parseTransform and postTransform compensate this lack of syntactic
data by use of semantic informations from databases.

I think that macro expansion should be done just after initial parse
(before any semantic transformations), that is why I have written
my macro expander.  BTW: current Axiom way allow pretty weird 
macro tricks, but it seems that algebra uses only small, well
behaved subset.

P.S. Thanks for the attached code.

| Try starting with minimal databases.  You will get messages as:
| 
| Integer is not a known type
| 
| or
| 
| Boolean is not a known type

Yes, that adds evidence to my claim that the compiler knows about
Integer and other basic types: they are gotten through the databases,
and the compiler (in its current state) cannot do anything meaningful
without that knowledge.  That is what I meant.

| Compiler do have _some_ knowledge: Record, Union, Mapping and
| Enumeration are built-in.

Yes. Record, Union, and MApping are necessary.  

For Enumerations, I have not make my mind yet.  Som built-in support
is needed, but it is not clear to me that level of built-in is needed.

|  There are some more or less random
| pieces of information hardcoded in various parts of the compiler.

Yes, a systematic approach for restructuring the compiler (as well as
the interpreter) is needed.  No doubt.  My primary concern is about
laying down precisely the rules.  That needs some kind of basic "first
principles".  That is what I'm aiming at.  I largely regard the
current setting as a defective departure that needs correction.  The
question is what to correct?  And in which directions?  

| But Integer, Boolean and List are recognized only if present in
| databeses.

and if they are not, the compilation is screwed!  You cannot really
define them as "secondary", because they come as annotation for
constants,a nd they parser knows they must mean something.  They
really are "primary" from the compiler point of view.  The compiler
needs to query the database because, it believes that Integer has more
properties (e.g. Euclidean domain) than it assumes.  That is not the
case for a Record for example, neither for Mapping.  The case of List
is a bit curious.  However, my *guessing* from reading the code for
List is that it was realized that List can be assumed a basic domain,
but later enriched in an algebra file -- embryonic ideas for "post
facto extensions". 

| Note that already postTransform uses semantic information:
| 
| postAtom x ==
|   $BOOT => x
|   x=0 => '(Zero)
|   x=1 => '(One)
|   EQ(x,'T) => 'T_$ -- rename T in spad code to T$
|   IDENTP x and GETDATABASE(x,'NILADIC) => LIST x
|   x
|                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But that really is not semantic information -- you don't need to
evaluate "x" to know what it means.  That information is
purely syntactic, because you can infer it from purely syntactic
considerations looking at the parse form of a definition.

Now, if your point is that the post-parser transformer should be fixed
to clearly delimit the phase, the answer is yes.  As the key is
approach this from the angle of "what it ideally should do?"; then you
look at the current approximation and see where the defect is.

| and parseTransform (more precisely parseHas) again preforms database
| lookup. 

Much less than the interpreter.  Still before and during the type
checking phase, we don't need to consult the databas, except, except,
when we have an "import" statement.  But, even there I'm not sure
looking at the database is the right answer.

| I use the following Integer for bootstrap:
| 
| )abbrev category INS IntegerNumberSystem
| IntegerNumberSystem(): Category == with nil
| )abbrev domain INT Integer
| Integer: IntegerNumberSystem with
|     FakeIdentityToAppeaseSpad: % -> %
|   == add
|     FakeIdentityToAppeaseSpad(x) == x
| 
| This is enough to convince compiler that Integer is a valid type.  I do
| not see how better Integer will help in bootstrap.  More precisely to
| bootstrap you need to resolve forward references.  And the problem is
| that in _last_ bootstrap pass there is a lot of forward references.
| I do not think that will help resolve those references.

No, but you're looking at a much higher level and you don't see the
trees. 

The question, for each individual uses of Integer is what is needed?
If you use "+", then the above fake is insufficient.
Where the "post factor" extensions helps is that you can add those
required operations as you go.  This process is very diffrent from
asserting that Integer belongs to a given caterogy.

| I guess that you think about something like classic compiler bootstrap,
| where you need to get translator for small language running and than
| you can use it to translate rest of the compiler.

Yes, but there is nothing un-classic here, except that the runtime
support is a Lisp system.  And precisely, we should take advantage of
that. You extend the small think and load it, and have an improved
version.  That is much simpler that the "classic" compiler bootstrap.
Remember, they bootstrapped Lisp before they bootstrapped C, so if
sometrhing is classic, it certainly is Lsip bootstrapping :-)

|  In particular such
| set of basic domains would allow to write large part of compiler in
| Spad. 

YES!

I believe, I already stated that many times in the past.
I evene recalled Bill saying that from his point of view Boot was
conceived as a mini-SPAD, but I would have to disagree with him on
several technical points :-)


| But current bootstrap problem is really all about databases,

Get rid of the databases, or said differently look at the database as
the final thing with the belts and whistles.  Don't design the
bootstrap process around it.  It is what you build as wrap up.  Think
of it as the .so or .a you ship to user.  You don't build your
compiler to depend on it for its own bootstrap.  You design your
compiler so that it can produce the library and use it.  Shift
perspective. 

| we do not care if during database bootstrap we get correct code (or
| any code at all),

We should care that we get correct code.  Compiler miscompilation is a
nightmarre to debug.

| we just want to collect type declaration.  

And most of this can be done at the abstract syntax level -- given the
relatively simple syntax.

| And
| we need a lot of declarations in databases to start compiling
| current Axiom algebra.

If we get to the point that the compiler can handle a unit
(e.g. source file) at a time, then you can rely on mutually recursive
definition to sort out the initial problem.

OK, that is nothing then :-)

| call to a simple flattener (to replace nested trees having semicolon
| as operator by lists) and pretty-printed the result of flattener 
| (without flattening the expression had too much nesting and

OK.  I'm nervous about having to duplicate the work of the post-parser
transformer.  It should be fixed so that you don't have to outsource
its job.

[...]

| My Lisp code is throw-away code (or research if you prefer such name).
| The basic thing is that I am getting better turnaroud with sbcl.  
| I can load the algebra tree into sbcl in about half of second (I am
| loading it from a fasl).  Tree walk trough this tree takes small part
| of second.  If I have large output most of the time is spent pretty-printing
| the results, which may take few seconds.  If results are small the
| whole run may finish in a second.  I do not see how I could get
| such turnaroud working inside Axiom tree.  FYI, Axiom needed about
| 70 seconds to parse algebra -- I certainly do not want to loose
| 70 seconds each time I try something.

Now, the question is whether it is an inherent inefficient in Axiom,
or its runtime system (GCL).  I know that some long time GCL users
have complained about GCL spending too much time doing unnecessary
work (mostly done on its behalf by GCC).

If it is an inherent deficiency in Axiom, we must know.

For example, there are many places in where an a-list is used, and
that a-list may induce in some places linear search -- when a
hash-table or just a good tree would have been better.  The 
the Environment (third slot of the triplet) is a horrible mess of
a-lists.

| I do not want to use output of parseTransform because it depends on
| databases. 

yes but the uses of the databases at that particular point are not
necessary. If you fix that, do you still need to duplicate the job?

| If databases miss some information the resulting tree
| is incorrect (sometimes the compiler will later fix such a tree, but
| many cases lead to errors).  

IF you can process a file in a whole -- which you can with the
skeleton I posted earlier -- you don't need to consult the databases.

| 
| I think that currect Axiom apprach to compilation has serious flaw.
| Namely postTransform and parseTransform are dane _before_ macro
| expansion.  This means that they have only limited syntactic
| information and some transformations just work blindly.  Both
| parseTransform and postTransform compensate this lack of syntactic
| data by use of semantic informations from databases.
| 
| I think that macro expansion should be done just after initial parse
| (before any semantic transformations), that is why I have written
| my macro expander.  BTW: current Axiom way allow pretty weird 
| macro tricks, but it seems that algebra uses only small, well
| behaved subset.

I believe I don't understand why the macro expansion *needs* to be
done before postTransform and parseTransform.  I'm not saying you're
wrong; I'm saying "can you elaborate?".

Hello *,

I am wondering what is the latest AXIOM release for Linux?

When the next release for Windows is planned (at least approximately)?

Thanks in advance.

Trying to get Axiom to build on the Mac is pretty frustrating, mainly  
because the build fails on GCL.  Since I already have access to at  
least two (and possibly more) excellent Lisp implementations I  
regularly use, it would be great to use one of them instead.  (Or at  
least, use a precompiled GCL, if I have one on my system).

Has anyone made any progress working with Axiom in a non-GCL  
environment?

Thanks,

-Brent

There have been documented successful build reports on Mac OS/PowerPC.  So,
could you be more specific?

Sorry, no windows. Bill?

Vladimir, did you consider taking the price for porting AldorUnit to Axiom?
Would be really nice!

Good luck!

I'll try to document the Taylor series patch provided by Igor Khakvine, so that
it is not only included in wh-sandbox, but also in trunk. (Although I accept
help, of course)

There are quite a few "fix proposed" issues on IssueTracker. If you find time
could you walk through them and send me mail like "please send documentation
for #xxx", I'll try to make an effort.

I have also documented parts of ystream.spad, find it attached below.

  Implementation ==> add
 
This package uses the internal representation of [[Stream]]. There we read:

\begin{verbatim}
    -- This description of the rep is not quite true.
    -- The Rep is a pair of one of three forms:
    --    [value: S,             rest: %]
    --    [nullstream:    Magic, NIL    ]
    --    [nonnullstream: Magic, fun: () -> %]
    -- Could use a record of unions if we could guarantee no tags.

    NullStream:    S := _$NullStream$Lisp    pretend S
    NonNullStream: S := _$NonNullStream$Lisp pretend S

    Rep := Record(firstElt: S, restOfStream: %)
\end{verbatim}

<<pkg: YSTREAM ParadoxicalCombinatorsForStreams>>=  
    Y f ==
      y : ST A := CONS(0$I,0$I)$Lisp
      j := f y
      RPLACA(y,frst j)$Lisp
      RPLACD(y,rst j)$Lisp
      y
@ 

Let [[f: ST -> ST]]. We create a new stream [[y]], which we leave
uninitialized. For the moment, I cannot explain why the compiler accepts
[[CONS(0$I,0$I)$Lisp]] as a stream. However, since [[Stream]]s are lazy, %
[[f y]] doesn't compute any elements of the stream. However, if [[f]] really
depends on its input, this dependence is then captured in the [[restOfStream]]
part of the record representing the stream. The next two lines replace
[[frstElt]] and [[restOfStream]] of [[y]] by those of [[j]], thus, now
[[restofStream]] of [[y]] depends on itself.

It seems that the $n$\textsuperscript{th} element of [[f y]] should only depend
on the first $n-1$ elements of [[y]]. For example, let us simulate the
computation of the first two elements of [[Y f]]: calling [[fun()]] returns the
first element $c_1$ of [[f y]]. Thus, [[Y f]] now equals $[c_1,\dots]$. Calling
[[fun()]] again, we have to get the second element of $f [c_1,\dots]$. Suppose
this equals $c_2$, and [[Y f]] now equals $[c_1,c_2,\dots]$.

<<pkg: YSTREAM ParadoxicalCombinatorsForStreams>>=  
    Y(g,n) ==
      x : L ST A := [CONS(0$I,0$I)$Lisp for i in 1..n]
      j := g x
      for xi in x for ji in j repeat
        RPLACA(xi,frst ji)$Lisp
        RPLACD(xi,rst ji)$Lisp
      x

Hello *,

I've just checked out build-improvements, ./configured it and started make:

grozin@gandalf ~/build-improvements $ make
Making in noweb
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/grozin/build-improvements/noweb/src'
cd c; make "CC=gcc -ansi -pedantic" "CFLAGS=" all
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/grozin/build-improvements/noweb/src/c'
notangle -Rheader errors.nw > errors.h
/bin/sh: notangle: command not found
make[2]: *** [errors.h] Error 127
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/grozin/build-improvements/noweb/src/c'
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/grozin/build-improvements/noweb/src'
make: *** [build/i686-pc-linux/bin/notangle] Error 2

I'll install noweb and try again. I just wonder: there is directory noweb, 
and, if external noweb is not found, it should be build? Or am I wrong?

While I'm at it, one more question. I have gcl 2.6.7 installed. It is in 
ansi mode (I need it for maxima). Will build-improvements build gcl in 
traditional mode from the sources in the gcl directory? Or it will simply 
fail? I'll see shortly, I just want to ask what it is supposed to do.

By the way, I use Gentoo current (very current, updated today :-). 
Build-improvements seems the best bet for constructing a reasonable 
ebuild, because it is distro-packager friendly. What do you think, is this 
branch ready for packaging? (I mean not the main portage tree, but an 
experimental overlay.) If not, when will it be ready for such wider 
testing by the Gentoo community?

Andrey

You're not doing anything wrong.  

This is a timestampe issue introduced recently when noweb was
unpackage in the source tree.  I should really fix that.
Here is how you can work around that:

    # from the top directory of the Axiom build-improvements branch
    # bring the timestamp up to date
    % (cd noweb/src/c/ && touch *.h *.c)
    # now issue make as usual
    % make

If gcl is visible from your PATH, then configure will pick it by
default and use it.  I have not tried gcl in ansi mode yet.
But, you can also convince Axiom's configure NOT to use the gcl from
your path (even if it found it):  add --without-gcl to your configure
command line.

one of the reasons why this branch was created was to make it
"distro-package friendly".  At the moment, I believe it supports the

ready for packaging.  However, it does not support cross-compilation
for deeper reasons.

It would be great if you could help in that regard!

I have not tried the Gold branch, but working from the "build  
improvements" branch (following the instructions shown on http://

The sed stuff is failing due to some kind of line-ending problem.   
Perhaps a UNIX/WINDOWS/MAC EOL issue?  Looking in a text editor  
doesn't show anything helpful.  Of course, once the autogeneration  
phase fails, everything else is broken after that point:

echo "ECHO start %1\lib\gcl-`cat majvers`.`cat minvers`\unixport\.exe

Grr!

Waldek's version is no better for this error.

I could diff the 'official' GCL and Axiom GCL directories to see  
what's wrong, if that might be helpful.

If anyone has successfully built on Mac, please let me know if you  
had to do anything fancy.  I already tried adjusting my pathing to  
exclude my MacPorts stuff, but that didn't seem to help (using or not  
using it resulted in the same problem).

Thanks,

- -Brent

This posting is in response to Andrey Grozin's questions here
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-09/msg00076.html
which were recently referenced by CY.

I wanted to get my mathml package delivering output.  Here's what I did.

1.  created output mathml section in src/interp/setvars.boot.pamphlet by
copying
    and modifying the tex section. Remember to add "<<outputmathmlCode>>" at
    end.
    Copied setvars.boot.pamphlet and ran notangle on it.
    From inside axiom ran )lisp (boottran::boottocl "tmp/setvars.boot")
    which put setvars.clisp into int/interp/setvars.clisp and then replaced
    the lisp in setvars.boot.pamphlet with that in setvars.clisp.
    code chunks:
     <<outputmathmlCode>>
     <<setOutputMathml>>
     <<describeSetOutputMathml>>
    variables:
        setOutputMathml
    $mathmlOutputStream
    $mathmlOutputFile
    $mathmlFormat
    describeSetOutputMathml

2.  create output mathml section in setvart.boot.pamphlet.
     Added line
    mathml        create output in MathML style         Off:CONSOLE
    to \section{output} table

    Added <<outputmathml>> to code chunk <<output>> in \section{output}
    code chunks:
     <<outputmathml>>
    variables:
    setOutputMathml
    $mathmlFormat
    $mathmlOutputFile

3.  Added
    ${OUT}/MMLFORM.o to Layer 17 of Makefile.pamphlet
    So far I've eliminated the analog of TEX1, doesn't seem to be needed.
      I added the line
    "mathml.spad.pamphlet (MMLFORM)" to layer 17 completed spad files.
    I added a dependency in my package so it needs to be in layer 17 rather
    than layer 14 where TEX appears.
    Incidentally why does TEX1 appear in layer 4 when it seems to depend
    on TEX which appears in layer 14?
    Added lines to SPADFILES  and DOCFILES.

4.  Added
    (|MathMLFormat| . MMLFORM)
    to exposed.lsp.pamphlet

5.  Added
    DONE mathml.spad.pamphlet
    DONE )abbrev package MMLFORM MathMLFormat
    to Lattice.pamphlet.
    Stepped through Lattice.pamphlet by searching for "TEX" and
    mimiced everthing for MMLFORM however I can't see that
    Lattice.pamphlet is actually used anymore.

6.  Added mathml.spad subsection to src/doc/axiom.bib.pamphlet.

7.  Added
mathmlFormat expr ==
  mml := '(MathMLFormat)
  mmlrep := '(String)
  formatFn := getFunctionFromDomain("coerce",mml,[$OutputForm])
  displayFn := getFunctionFromDomain("display",mml,[mmlrep])
  SPADCALL(SPADCALL(expr,formatFn),displayFn)
  TERPRI $mathmlOutputStream
  FORCE_-OUTPUT $mathmlOutputStream
  NIL

  to interp/i-output.boot.pamphlet

  To function "output(expr,domain)" add lines for mathml,e.g.
     "if $mathmlFormat then mathmlFormat expr".

After all this I successfully compile axiom (using gold branch) so
now I can do this:

(1) -> )set messages autoload off
(1) -> )set output tex on
(1) -> )set output mathml on
(1) -> (x+y)**2

         2           2
   (1)  y  + 2x y + x
$$
{y \sp 2}+{2 \  x \  y}+{x \sp 2}
\leqno(1)
$$

> I wanted to get my mathml package delivering output....

Excellent. This seems to be a simple enough change that we could
pick it up quite quickly. There is a browser plugin by Sam Dooley,
a previous Axiom author, that handles MathML. I can't remember the
name though.

In order to pick up this work into the mainstream axiom it still
lacks a few pieces:

1) DOCUMENTATION. besides modifying the pamphlet files it would
   be useful if you could write down any understanding you gained
   about how the current code works and why you needed to change
   what you did. It's the 'WHY' that is most important to future
   people trying to follow your changes. Assume some other person
   is trying to understand and change your code 30 years later.
   Plus, if you made the effort to understand how Axiom works in
   some small piece, it is worth capturing that understanding so
   others can build on it. For instance, why does TEX1 appear 
   useless? What did you depend on that moved your code up the
   layer chain? Is there a 1-to-1 correspondence between MathML
   constructs and Axiom-Tex constructs? Does your code cover all
   the cases?



2) MORE DOCUMENTATION. I, and many others, do not know the details
   of MathML. Perhaps finding/referencing/writing some overview as
   well as adding bibliographic references would be useful. Look at
   dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet for an example of possible documentation.
   A discussion of the possible forms of equation output in Axiom
   and their generation by your code would make the whole change
   much easier to maintain and modify once they come out the MATHML 2.0



3) TESTS. MathML works for your example. But a reasonable test suite
   is needed to check the range of coverage and to make sure it doesn't
   get broken in the future. One of two approaches seem reasonable to
   me, although any reasonable test strategy is fine. You could either
   collect a large number of axiom input syntax expressions into a
   single file and run your code against this set, thus testing the
   robustness on "random" input you didn't create. You could also give
   some thought to a "coverage" test suite to show that you handle
   things like summation symbols, equation numbering, various bracing
   styles, tables, as well as the usual things like exponentiation, etc.

   This kind of testing really won't cover the "format" issues for 
   output and I'm not sure how we could do that. But it will test for
   code-breakage on random and constructed input. Axiom users can
   create their own output formats for their domains which is not
   constrained to follow "standard math".

   Please add your test files to the src/input/Makefile.



4) PATCH FILES. Run

     diff -Naur axiomfile.pamphlet yourfile.pamphlet >axiomfile.pamphlet.patch

   so we can see exactly what changed in each file. The "-Naur" option is
   the standard way to create axiom patch files.

This is really the only way to "get it off your desk" and into the
distribution. I try to pick up changes I understand "in the small"
which I can test but more glorious changes really require your effort.
Packaging changes to "get it off your desk" is three times more work.
I'd like to be able to pick things up that seem "simple" but since I'm
not the author I have no real ability to debug it when the merge breaks.

This is really good news!

But maybe you find it possible to change the way
how Axiom releases are actually released.

1) IMHO publish release as CVS tree on SorceForge
is bad practice.  To make sure whether something
have changed or I still have some old release
I have to check all hundreds of files in CVS tree.
Publishing release as a single file (tarball)
is common practice and is much better IMHO.

2) I'd like to see some consistent version
numbering scheme for Axiom releases which
will last more than one year.  It will be
of great help for maintainers of .rpm and
.deb packages who package Axiom for
various Linux distributions and users
who use these packages.
Try to find axiom on www.rpmfind.com and
you'll see that now each packager invents
his own package numbering scheme - all
different.

I understand that both issues are purely
technical but I think they are important
enough from practical point of view.
After all this is question of identity.

With best regards,

Vadim

I propose that the next version be 3.5.0, with subsequent bug fix
releases, be 3.5.x.
When we merge build-improvements to trunk, I would suggest we bump it
to 4.0.0.

I also propose that on a regular bases (e.e.g 3 months), we make

Indeed.

> 1) IMHO publish release as CVS tree on SorceForge is bad practice...

That's unlikely to change, at least by me. I'm only trying to maintain
the source tree, not the release of binaries. The sources also live at
savannah.nongnu.org (CVS), axiom-developer.org (arch), and 
sourceforge.net (SVN), as well as on google.

I could create a tarball and store it on these sites except for one
problem, ... time. I simply don't have the time. I'm not a company.
I'm one guy sitting in a room working on this at night and on weekends
as a hobby.  However, if you have the interest you could maintain
tarballs on these sites.  Advocacy is volunteering.

I put together a web page showing a grid of binaries and their
platforms (<http://daly.axiom-developer.org/axiombinary>) which was
mentioned on this list a while ago and, I believe, was picked up by
<http://wiki.axiom-developer.org> (I don't see it there now). However,
no one has contributed any binaries.



> 2) I'd like to see some consistent version numbering scheme....

Check the mailing list archives. We've had this discussion and
several schemes were proposed, such as the usual Major.Minor.Patch
schemes. We settled on a version scheme, which is consistent, 
which is machine checkable, and which has been used for years.

There is a VERSION variable in the top level Makefile.
This variable is changed with every new release of the source code.

This version is printed in the banner when Axiom starts:

                AXIOM Computer Algebra System
                Version: Axiom (September 2006)
      Timestamp: Thursday December 14, 2006 at 20:11:24

The Version: says what source release was used for the build.
The Timestamp: says what date and time the binary build occurred.

The VERSION variable is: boot::*build-version* which you can access:


 -> _*BUILD_-VERSION_*$Lisp
 (1) Axiom (September 2006)
                                              Type: SExpression

 -> )lisp *build-version*
 Value = "Axiom (September 2006)"

Since source releases occur (on a best-effort) basis every two months
there is no ambiguity to the Month-Year format. 


The TIMESTAMP variable is: boot::*yearweek* which you can access:

 -> _*YEARWEEK_*$Lisp
 (2) Thursday December 14, 2006 at 20:11:24 
                                              Type: SExpression

 -> )lisp *yearweek*
 Value = "Thursday December 14, 2006 at 20:11:24 "

The variable name "yearweek" comes from the fact that I used to release
Axiom on a weekly basis when I was at IBM and it was my primary job.

Hello,

I have uploaded a version of Axiom built on top of SBCL for Windows (32
bits).
So if you are a Windows user, you already know Axiom and you can spent some
time
for testing and reporting bugs I would really be happy.

Things that you have to know:

* You must know Axiom,
* You have an official version of Axiom (built on top of GCL) for Windows,
* You must know that this version comes with absolutely no warranty of any
kind,
* "How to use it" is not supported,
* Bug (that is, bug in this version not present in the official one) MUST be
  reported to vanuxemg at yahoo dot fr and not to the official Axiom bug
tracking systems,
* This is not the same version than the official one (the code differs),
* This is not a fork (code in this version is destined to be included in the
official version),
* The source code is NOT available (sorry, not yet),
* Do not discuss issues related to this version on the official Axiom
mailing lists unless
  this is explicitely permitted,
* This version contains a LOT of bugs,
* This version is based on an "experimental" version of SBCL so you'll
contribute to SBCL
  too if you find SBCL bugs, but do know that all of this is experimental,
* Do not trust its results.


It can be downloaded from:
http://perso.orange.fr/parabola/axiom-sbcl-win.tar.bz2

To use it, untar/unbzip2 it in a directory without space in its name (full
path without space).
Export the environment variable AXIOM, it must point to the directory that
contains
the algebra, bin etc... directories.

So for example:

set AXIOM=c:\somewhere\axiom-sbcl-win

and you can start it with

c:\somewhere\axiom-sbcl-win\bin\interpsys


One of the the most important thing to know is that this work is based on
the
work of Juergen Weiss (among others of course), he "ported" parts of Axiom
to the CMU Common Lisp system.

Many, many thanks to you, Juergen Weiss.

Greg

"Do not discuss issues related to this version on the official Axiom
mailing lists unless explicitly permitted"

Well, it's axiom. it's in development. this is the most likely place
to discuss it. you don't need permission to discuss anything on this
list (although some topics, like legal topics which have their own
list, can generate some pushback).

But if you want permission, you have mine for what that's worth.

It seems perfectly reasonable to discuss the SBCL effort here.

Tim

The "machine checkable" thing is a non-argument.

There are other meaningful machine checkable alternative as well.

With a 3 months cycles, I think a schema like the ones used by Gentoo or Ubuntu
makes sense: 2007.3, 2007.6.....or 7.03, 7.06....where is clearly
visible when it was
released.

I say this because maybe there is no that many changes for the X.Y.Z
schema, even when I am aware that this is usually the standard.

Just my 0.005 cents.

Alfredo

Isn't that already obvious and clear? I think this applies to
all open source projects including the open source version(s)
of Axiom.

Do you prefer this for your own personal reasons? I do not see
why your work should not be included along with the other current
and experimental version of Axiom. It is possible to make special
provision (i.e. new categories) in the Axiom wiki IssueTracker
system to refer to your new version so that we can easily
distinguish to which version the issue applies.

I do not know what is really "official" any more. Juergen Weiss'
experimental version of Axiom on CMUCL has been discussed before
on this list and his original source code has been distributed.
Some of his changes have been incorporated into the "official"
sources in available via CVS and at SourceForge.

I think it would be perfect if you would make this source available
as a branch in SVN at SourceForge.

As Tim Daly has already pointed out: no permission is required
to discuss any Axiom related issue on the "official" Axiom mailing
lists. In fact, discussing Axiom any other way seems rather
pointless to me.

I think that this is not a surprise and does not differ from other
current experimental versions of Axiom.

Great. I am very glad that someone has finally begun to work
publicly with Axiom on another version of Lisp.

That applies to ALL computer algebra systems - even the expensive

>=20

Yes, as I have said before: Juergen's work on the CMU version
was (and still is) critically important to the current open
source version of Axiom. I think it would be great if someone
would take on the job of making the source for the CMU version
available in the SourceForge SVN repository. I think there may
be some people who would be willing to test it further and to
contribute changes and improvements.

I don't think we should be afraid to work on several different
versions of Axiom in parallel, especially when one of the stated
goals is to of the Axiom project is to support Axiom on a number
of different Common Lisp environments.

Thanks again, Greg, for making your work available!

Regards,
Bill Page.

I get the following result on by Windows XP SP2 system while
running under Cygwin, using 'wget ...' and 'tar xjvf' to
extract the binary and setting the AXIOM variable:

$ echo $AXIOM
/home/Administrator/axiom-sbcl-win

$ /home/Administrator/axiom-sbcl-win/bin/interpsys

This is a native Windows application so SBCL does not
understand the path used (Cygwin specific).

Duh! I should have realized ... thanks.

You it works. Great job. I think this is a great step forward
for a fully ANSI-compliant common lisp implementation of Axiom.
I can't resist to ask: Have you tried building this version of
Axiom with GCL in ANSI mode?

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. Could you explain the phrase: "Kitten of Death" :-)

Greg,

So far I have two problems with axiom-sbcl-win to report:

1) The )cd command does not work as expected. Here is an
   example with my comments marked --->

-------

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\Desktop>set
AXIOM=3DC:\cygwin\home\Administrator\axiom-sbcl-win

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\Desktop>cd "c:\Documents =
and
Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My Documents"

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My
Documents>C:\cygwin\home\Administrator\axiom-sbcl-win\bin\interpsys

This is SBCL 1.0, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

(1) -> )sys cd
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My Documents

---> The current system path is correct.

(1) -> )cd
   The current AXIOM default directory is
      C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\

---> This current directory is wrong. So this file is not found.

(1) -> )co FOO.spad

   The file FOO.spad is needed but does not exist.

---> But we can set it explicitly

(1) -> )cd "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My Documents"
   The current AXIOM default directory is
      C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My Documents\

---> Now it works.

   Compiling AXIOM source code from file
      C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My Documents\FOO.spad

   ...

---> The package is compiled (FASL) and loaded and executes as
     expected. Great!

---------

Note: This problem occurs even if the path does not contain any
spaces.

But here is the second problem.

2) If I compile the same file twice, the existing compiler output is
not replaced:

(1) -> )co FOO.spad
   ...
   finalizing NRLIB FOO
The system cannot find the file specified.
The system cannot find the file specified.
The system cannot find the path specified.
The system cannot find the path specified.

   >> System error:

Note: This re-compile problem does *not* occur if the current
directory is set to a path that contains no spaces.

Bill Page.

Interesting!  Not being a Windows user I can't check this out directly, 
but it is good news.

I have a couple of questions concerning how this has been accomplished, 
although they may be premature:

1.  You mentioned Juergen Weiss's CMUCL port - did you alter that code 
to run on SBCL or use the techniques there as a guide and convert one of 
the other trees?

2.  Did you change the boot/SPAD compilers to output SBCL compliant lisp 
code, or hand tweak the lisp code produced by the "regular" compile?

Back when I took a run at SBCL + Axiom, one of the points that became 
quickly clear was that short of carrying through with a complete 
conversion of all boot code to lisp (a long term goal at the moment) or 
simply living with hand tweaked translator output for a large number of 
files at least the boot compiler and possibly the spad compiler would 
need to be adjusted to output ANSI lisp.  I was able to just about load 
the stand-alone bootstrap boot->lisp system after some tweaking, but I 
didn't carry much further than that.

Gaby has proceeded much deeper into the BOOT world than I was ever able 
to and the presence of old and new BOOT (shoe?) adds a rather unexpected 
twist.  The prospect of fixing BOTH variations to output correct code is 
not a particularly enjoyable one.  My hope was that the new BOOT (shoe) 
was the stand alone code in the boot directory, which I suspect would be 
somewhat simpler to get working as the first step in getting sbcl to 
support the complete build chain as it exists today in GCL.

Gaby, did SHOE ever reach a point where it could convert all of the 
Axiom BOOT code to lisp?  I recall there being a couple of different 
conventions between BOOT and SHOE but I don't remember the conclusion - 
  can the conversion be made?

Cheers,
CY

Excellent news.  Is there anything I/we can do to help that process
along?  When we have that, I would like to take another run at getting
the complete bootstrap process working on sbcl.  Roughly, I think it
will work something like:

1.  Get boottocl working and compare the generated output to the
current output, and identify any differences.  Once we can generate the
same output, in theory Boot/Shoe should be functional.  I don't
anticipate any tremendous difficulty here based on my earlier
experiences.

2.  Once it is working, start tracking down gotchas that prevent the
generated lisp code from working in SBCL, and start tweaking BOOT to
generate correct results.  In one sense I would prefer to work directly
with the lisp code but I think that is too large a project to start
with - fixing BOOT to generate legal ANSI code should (hopefully) be a
relatively straightforward change.

3.  Once we can load the generated files from BOOT successfully, see if
the SPAD compiler also needs fixing.  If the translation is
SPAD->Boot->Lisp we should be OK, but I'm guessing it's SPAD->Lisp and
so more tweaking will be needed.  Hopefully the changes to BOOT will
map fairly readily to SPAD as well.

The completion of that process should leave us with a functional Axiom
on sbcl using the existing process and no hand tweaked lisp files other
than the ones that are lisp now, which I think is where we want to
start when merging portability changes back into the main tree given
the current build situation.  Hand tweaked lisp files that are supposed
to be autogenerated will work in specific cases but will be hard to
maintain, so I think we need to bite the bullet and go back to the
source.  Once we are running in sbcl using the existing bootstrap
process we can try many things (like asdf) without being forced to step
carefully around the build issues, which I think will help speed things
up.

Cheers,
CY

The New Boot translator has the command  boottran::boottoclc (no the

I have to make a list of reserved words or "library" functions that
both Old Boot and New Boot use.  That should help you quickly focuse

Yes.  Note also that the New Boot translator has the framework to
generate machine code (when told where the CL compiler is) from Boot
and load it in the running image at a go.

There are still some GCL-isms deeply embedded in Axiom.

No, I dropped support of GCL because of spurious bugs: (cond ...)
handled strangely (a runtime problem apparently). But I added some
modifications to allow it to run on the "ANSI" version of GCL. They are
not tested of course.

No :-) It comes from the SBCL banner (on Windows only).

Thanks. I think the GCL main developer Camm Maquire would be
strongly motivated to help with ensuring that an ANSI version
of Axiom works with GCL, especially as a means to test and
improve GCL's support for ANSI. As I recall he is away for a
few more weeks but we should expect some comment from him on
this when he returns.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thanks for reporting these problems, they are added on my TODO list and
in fact the problem is more complex, we need some functions that
generate correct (portable) pathname. I have modified some functions in
this regards but I do not always use them. I (or we) will use them later
but these type of things (and a lot of other from my point of view) need
to be "uniformized" and well defined (the API and it's _REAL_
conformance to ANSI CL).

Aim for POSIX -- they already have done the work -- and have tools
that convert non-POSIX to POSIX.  In essence, that is what MinGW does
with the path names.

I completely based this work on the version of Juergen Weiss. My work
was essentially the one of an ant. I grepped the code for "cmu" added
support of SBCL and Clisp. After that I added some files and modified
bootsys so that it can be compiled on GCL, SBCL, Clisp and (for the fun)
Allegro CL. Finally I tried to fix as much as can bugs.

Juergen Weiss did an amazing work...

Of course there are some GLC'ish things in the boot code, as Gaby said
previously, that needed to be fixed. I must point out that what I have
done will need to be checked by Lisp specialists. The version that I'll
share will not be the one I'm working on. I added to this "shareable"
version a tons of things from the official Axiom such that it'll be easy
to diff it. But I intimately think that we have to reorganise, simplify,
factorise, develop and document the code when we will merge changes. I
already began to reorganise the code, this is a pain to work on, say
stream for example, when the code is disseminated everywhere...

No the code (from spad, bootsys boot and old boot) produced by the versio=
n
on which I'm working (presumably the same than the official Axiom))
is compilable and "runnable" by SBCL, CMU [1] and Clisp.

Spad, bootsys boot and old boot can be compiled without problem  :-). It'=
s really
simple to add support of SBCL, Clisp, CMU and Allegro (though I'm pretty =
sure
some bugs remain) to bootsys.=20

I forgot to say one thing, I have not "ported" the socket code. I need
first to better understand some parts of Axiom relative to this.

Greg

PS : I have a couple of problems with CMU CL, it can not compile some fun=
ctions
and I don't know why as of now.

Nothing personal. But for now the code is not public so this is
problematic. I prefer to not pollute official Axiom bugs tracker.

There are, already, a lot of versions of Axiom (gold, silver,
build-improvements, wh-sandbox...), I do not want to add yet another
one. Don't know how this has to be handled.

The big problem is to find a simple way to reproduce it, I haven't one.
I have sent a bug report (for GCL-2.7) to Camm ("Disparition of a
condition ?") and it may be similar to the one in gcl-2.6.8pre so... The
big problem is that I'm alone with this bug, Bill and Waldek does not
have this bug. The bug is (on 2.6.8):

(1) -> )set br query
(1) -> 1/0
=20
   >> Error detected within library code:
   division by zero


   You have two options. Enter:
     top        to return to top level, or
     break      to enter a LISP break loop.

   Please enter your choice now:

Normally we have three choices... (and the code looks correct, I don't
understand).

I dropped support of GCL, but that does not mean I don't want to support
GCL. The code on which I'm working is destined to be included on a
version that supports GCL.

Have you tried to use precompiled GCL?  On Linux I regulary use
such method:

GCL=/path/to/gcl ../wh-sandbox/configure

There is a little catch:  last time I chcecked build did not work
with ANSI version of GCL.  But gcl-2.6.7 and 2.6.8 worked fine.

X-List-Received-Date: Mon, 12 Feb 2007 20:43:42 -0000

I would like here to make some remarks concering bug 312.  First,
this bug is really in 'powern' function defined in 
'sttaylor.spad.pamphlet'.  Below is (corrected) version contained
in wh-sandbox:

      powern(rn,x) ==
        order : I := 0
        for n in 0.. repeat
          empty? x => return zro()
          not zero? frst x => (order := n; leave x)
          x := rst x
          n = 1000 =>
            error "**: series with many leading zero coefficients"
        (ord := (order exquo denom(rn))) case "failed" =>
          error "**: rational power does not exist"
        co := frst x
        if ord > 0 and rn < 0 then
           error "**: negative power does not exist"
        (invCo := recip co) case "failed" =>
           error "** rational power of coefficient undefined"
-- This error message is misleading, isn't it? see sups.spad/cRationalPower
        power :=
--          one? co => YS(powerrn(rn,x,#1))
          (co = 1) => YS(powerrn(rn,x,#1))
          (denom rn) = 1 =>
            not negative?(num := numer rn) =>
-- It seems that this cannot happen, but I don't know why
              (co**num::NNI) * YS(powerrn(rn,(invCo :: A) * x,#1))
            (invCo :: A)**((-num)::NNI) * YS(powerrn(rn,(invCo :: A) * x,#1))
          RATPOWERS => co**rn * YS(powerrn(rn,(invCo :: A) * x,#1))
          error "** rational power of coefficient undefined"
        monom(1,(ord :: I) * numer(rn)) * power

-------------------------

At first glance this function looks cryptic.  But look at documentation:

      powern : (RN,ST A) -> ST A
        ++ powern(r,f) raises power series f to the power r.

So 'powern' is supposed to raises Taylor series to a rational power.
How one can to such thing?  If Taylor series has form f=1+c_1*x+...
(the lowest order term is zero) one can recursively compute coefficients
using the fact that:

  (f+a*x^n)^r = f^r+r*a*x^n mod x^(n+1)

Axiom code uses YS operator to solve this reccurence: this is done
in assignment to 'power' variable.

If the series has non-zero, non one lowest order term, that is

f = c_0*(1+c_1*x+...),

we just have to divide f by c_0 and multiply the result by
c_0^r (this is also handled in the assignment to power).

So the remaining case is when the lowest order term is 0.  In this
case 

f = x^a*f_1 

where f_1 has non-zero lowest order term.  We handle f_1 by earlier
method while (x^a)^r = x^(a*r).  However, we want a Taylor series
as a result, so we must require that a*r is a natural number.

Now, the first part of 'powern' handles splitting this power of x:

        order : I := 0
        for n in 0.. repeat
          empty? x => return zro()
          not zero? frst x => (order := n; leave x)
          x := rst x
          n = 1000 =>
            error "**: series with many leading zero coefficients"

(note that 'x' in the code is what I call 'f' above, while my 'a' is
called 'order' in the code).  Next, we check that order*r is an 
integer:

        (ord := (order exquo denom(rn))) case "failed" =>
          error "**: rational power does not exist"

Remember first nonzero coefficient:

        co := frst x

Check that we get nonnegative order*r:

        if ord > 0 and rn < 0 then
           error "**: negative power does not exist"

I skip assignment to power (explained eariler).  Finally we have
to multiply the result by correct power of 'x':

        monom(1,(ord :: I) * numer(rn)) * power

(note that ord = order/denom(rn), so ord * numer(rn) = order*rn).

Checking in SVN archive shows that the last line was omitted in
revision 19.  The change in revision 19 added support for negative
integer powers, it is clear that omission of last line was
unintentional.

At this point, I'd say with everyone exploring and testing at a very
basic level the only thing to do is to keep a list as best we can. 
Eventually things will probably come together as the best solutions
appear, but for a while it's going to be a bit crazy.

The requirement to document code in a literate fashion means the hurdle
to get code in the main tree is high, and that means a lot of
experimental branches will spring up as people do "not ready for prime
time" work.  In some ways this might actually keep people from assuming
Axiom is ready for uses it isn't really ready for, so it's not all bad.

Cheers,

Gaby, how do you plan to avoid latent bugs due to semantic differences
between Boot and Shoe?  AFAICS Shoe accepts almast all (or maybe all)
Boot, but trying to use it results in build failure due to mistranslation.
Do you have a tool that can flag places where semantics of Boot and Shoe
differ?

No, but the only places I'm aware of where both languages differ
is in a tiny part of "built-in" or "library" functions.

To have a tool that does what you say, we must have the difference in
semantics documented.

The differences are apparent once we have the table in
front of our eyes, and there we can have a warning is we want.
For any other construct, I'm not aware of semantics difference.

Well, I tried once to compile all .boot files using Shoe.  IIRC I was
able to quckly handle syntax errors.  But the process quickly died
during algebra build: clearly SPAD compiler was mistranslated.

I now tried to just convert 'postpar.boot.pamphlet'.  First, quoted
symbols such as 'if 'in 'where where upcased (AFAIUI you call this
"library" differences).  I am not aware of any more problem with
'postpar.boot.pamphlet', but ATM build is in progress and it will
take some time to verify results.  However, I also noticed another
problem: Shoe mistranslates some where constructs.  In particular,
in as.boot.pamphlet we have function asCategoryParts which has
where clause defining three functions: main, build, and exportsOf.
main references exportsOf.  Shoe renames the three nested functions,
but fails to rename reference in main to exportsOf.

No question.  It's a shame that work didn't get more press way back when.

OK, sounds good.  I'm fooling around with asdf at the moment trying to 
figure out how to work with it, which may be a bit premature but will 
hopefully be useful later on.  (Don't know how well GCL/asdf play 
together, I've never successfully run asdf on GCL personally.)

Really??  That's excellent news, but rather surprising.

Nice!  I have the code in the boot/ directory loading on sbcl as well, 
so it will be interesting to check what the various diffs look like.  I 
have tried running it on interp but I get what are probably the 
collisions between old boot and new boot Gaby mentioned before.

I'd say usockets and cl-fad might be of interest here (the links I 
provided in another email) but I don't have enough experience with 
either to know for sure.

Dear Waldek,

it seems that version 434 of wh-sandbox seems to install "document" to
axiom/target/.../bin

Is this only on my machine?

Furthermore, it seems that my packages get recompiled in any case, even if I
only did a configure to change the prefix.


Martin

Hello,

I've installed noweb and did

./configure --prefix=/usr --infodir=/usr/share/info \
--mandir=/usr/share/man --without-gcl

(because my external gcl is ansi), then make. After some time, I've got

This is a bug in GCL, also reported by Bill.  I'll check in a work
around for Axiom.

Gaby, et al.

Every time I download build-improvments on a new machine, I've been
thinking about the decision to include gcl and noweb source in the
Axiom source tree (in source format) in the SVN repository at
SourceForge. It seems to me that rather than having gcl inside the
tree

  /trunk
     ....
     /branches/wh-sandbox
    ...
     /branches/build-improvements
      /branches/build-improvements/gcl
      /branches/build-improvements/noweb
      ...

what we should have done is create a new root directory

  /trunk
     ....
     /branches/wh-sandbox
    ...
     /branches/build-improvements
    ...

  /extras
    /gcl
    /noweb
    ...

That way, it would be possible to avoid having to pull all the
source for gcl and noweb if these are already pre-installed.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Here is a patch that I use to solve this problem. It seems that at least
on some platforms, i.e. combinations of shell and/or make, gcl cannot
process the '-batch -eval' arguments in the the way one would expect.

Yes.  More curious is that Jacob Smith ran into similar problem on a
Debina based system only for some of the "-batch -eval" things.

:-(

Bill, please could you check in your patch?

That is a good alternative.
I would rename /extras to /tools though :-)


The implication though is that when we make a release, we must make
sure gcl and noweb are included.  That slightly complicates the logic
of the Makefiles, but it is doable.  Also we must watch out that
people don't forget building and testing --without-gcl and
--without-noweb (which will be the common cases).

I should probably add that with SVN, it is possible to branch "only"
directories people are interested, not the whole stuff.

| I don't understand why GCL and Noweb are included in the first place.

since this is a recuring discussion, we should probably have an FAQ
entry for it.  The archive has some record of the discussion.

indeed.  Because they are standard tools.

Which distros include noweb and GCL as standard tools?

You suppose right.

I don't think the inclusionof GCL was supposed to be forever.  It will
be however necessary, as long as it isn't standard tool.

Hello,

I have introduced two bugs in DFLOAT when I sent a patch against
sf.spad.pamphlet (outputting routine). Try, for example,
complex(1.7,-2.3@SF) or 3.0*x^3+-2.7@SF*x^2. Furthermore, the directive
used ("~G") is not "the" good one (it's not portable, the directive
works this way only on GCL). Patch in attachment (I have used the Float
method (via 'message')).

A suggestion, what about using )spool to produce *.output file?
(to simplify the comparison via diff of two versions of Axiom (different
banners)).

Greg

PS : Tested on Gold and Build-improvements (should work on Wh-sandbox, I
think). My tests were : building from scratch, tracing outputTran and
testing all outputting formats (algebra, fortran, tex etc...).

I forgot one thing, GCL adds something like "Starts dribbling to
test.axiom (2007/2/15, 23:13:40)" in the output file so this suggestion
does not help.

I wonder how portable "~A" is.  The standard promises nice output,
but nothing more.  OTOH all Lisp implementations that I tried get
"~G" wrong (GCL does not add trailing spaces, the other lose
some significant digits).

FYI: I use the script below.  The crucial thing is at the end:
I use sed to delete banner and timing messages.  I also normalize
paths that appear for various reasons (most from 'Loading' messages).

I hesitate to say it's useful, but I have what appears to be a (more or
less) working notangle command in lisp.  It successfully handles a
couple test files, and although I haven't inspected the results it
handled most of the contents of boot and interp without crashing. 
Unfortunately it's performance is worse than abysmal.  The first result
is with noweb's notangle on the boot and interp directories, the second
with the lisp one:

CL-USER> (load "./setup/cleardirs.lisp")
T
CL-USER> (time (load "./setup/runnotangle.lisp"))
Evaluation took:
  7.172 seconds of real time
  0.892056 seconds of user run time
  1.44809 seconds of system run time
  [Run times include 0.016 seconds GC run time.]
  0 calls to %EVAL
  0 page faults and
  12,691,344 bytes consed.
T
CL-USER> (load "./setup/cleardirs.lisp")

  610.982 seconds of real time
  591.209 seconds of user run time

  0 calls to %EVAL
  0 page faults and
  12,712,508,936 bytes consed.

What I'm hoping is all of the things I've undoubtedly done very very
wrong can be fixed, but I'm not sure at this point.  In the hopes that
this will prod someone into doing it right, I'll upload the files (and
yes the cl-notangle.lisp file was notangled by cl-notangle ;-).  I
haven't got a noweb command in lisp yet though, which I guess we would
need unless we switch to the latex-as-chunks style.

Cheers,
CY

Doing ./configure and make in a freshly checked-out tree with the latest 
Bill's patch, I get exactly the same error:

./../..//build/i686-pc-linux/bin/lisp -batch -eval \
                 '(progn (mapcar (function (lambda (x) (load x))) \

"stage0/tytree1.o"))) \
                         (system::save-system "bootsys"))'

Error: The variable |
| is unbound.
Fast links are on: do (si::use-fast-links nil) for debugging
Error signalled by PROGN.
Broken at MAPCAR.  Type :H for Help.

Maybe, changes of this kind are needed in several places?

Thanks,
Andrey

Your method of appending content to a chunk was quadratic.  Below
is a diff changing this to linear method, gives much better speed (at
least on "nag-e02.boot.pamphlet") but still much slower than Debian
notangle (0.48s sbcl, 0.028s system version).  AFAICS reading
pamphlets is still slow (takes 0.4s on "nag-e02.boot.pamphlet").

Thanks!  Wow, did that ever make a difference.  Where you running the
above after compiling cl-notangle.lisp or just loading it?  Running the
same comparison (I'm in SBCL 1.01, by the way) I've now got:

CL-USER> (time (load "./setup/runnotangle.lisp"))
Evaluation took:
  4.93 seconds of real time
  0.848053 seconds of user run time
  0.728046 seconds of system run time
  [Run times include 0.1 seconds GC run time.]
  0 calls to %EVAL
  0 page faults and
  12,686,456 bytes consed.

Which doesn't achieve Tim's goal of a faster notangle than notangle but
is usably quick.  Thanks Waldek!

I attached v0.2 with this patch applied.

CY

P.S. - I know the descriptive text in the file needs quite a lot of
improvement (for example I don't cite any sources at the moment) but
them's the breaks when it's 2am and you have to work tomorrow.  If
there is real interest in this as a tool for Axiom I'll try to spruce
it up some more.

Hi Cliff,

Wouldn't it make sense to contact the Texmacs people whether they would 
want some literate programming support. Or has Texmacs LP support already?

That's a good question.  I don't know if they support it - I'll have to
check tonight.  At the moment I can't compile TeXmacs for some reason
on my machine, so I'll have to figure that out first.  I don't know if
there would be interest on the product side.

The Emacs mode is nice but that syntax highlighting problem is annoying
and is apparently a limitation of mmm-mode - that plus the mathematical
WYSIWYG of TeXmacs could be Very Nice indeed.  Don't know how much work
is involved with making TeXmacs nice for our purposes, but it's
probably worth a look.

Cheers,
CY

And another one (it does not remove the last #\Newline):

(defun read-in-chunk (curr-chunk-name filename)
  (let* ((nl (string #\Newline))
        (lines (loop for nextline =3D (read-line filename nil)
                 while (or (not (search endchunkchars nextline))
                       (search (concatenate 'string (string #\")=20
                                        endchunkchars)
                                nextline))
                 collect (concatenate 'string nextline nl))))
      (if lines=20
            (add-to-chunk-contents curr-chunk-name=20
                            (apply #'concatenate 'string=20
                                 lines)))))

Only tested on nag-e02.boot.pamphlet with SBCL.

Generally doing read or readline calls is a very slow way to read a file.
Use read-sequence instead. The improvement is noticeable.

Well, every time I try texmacs I get frustrated after a few minutes.
Recently I downloaded TeXmacs-1.0.6.8-static-gnu-linux.tar.gz extracted
and started it. Then I started a Maple session typed just

2 + 3

and ENTER and texmacs stopped to respond.

After setting MATHLINK_PLATFORM I get a few warnings but Mma seems to work.

Anyway, always seem to run into trouble with TeXmacs although I find the 
idea very good and I think texmacs is very appropriate as an Axiom GUI 
and also (and in particular) for the literate programming way of writing 
  the Axiom program itself.

Well, I thought you in particular could trace that bug somehow. 
Unfortunately, I cannot do serious things in LISP.

I probably can, but my current (imperfect) understanding of the issue
is that it is buried deeply in the controlling of the Emacs syntax
highlighting routines and how they work.  It would probably involve
some serious greasemonkey work on mmm-mode's guts (I don't think
mmm-mode is being actively developed any more), and if I'm going to do
that I would rather turn the whole thing into a literate program and
actually understand what it is doing.  (I'd probably have to do that
much work anyway to figure out how to handle this.)

> Unfortunately, I cannot do serious things in LISP.

Well, I can't either ;-).  No point in letting that stop me though -
given enough head banging you can punch a hole in a brick wall :-).

Cheers,
CY

I'll take a look at read-sequence this weekend and see if I can figure
it out.

Tim, performance tuning and fixing a couple of hacks aside (I need to
look over Ralf's perl solution to make sure I've got my bases covered)
is this something that you think could be used in Axiom?  I wrote it
because I want to teach asdf how to handle Axiom's source files by
itself, and for experimental purposes it will probably serve in its
current form, but if there's a real chance of it being used in Axiom
proper I'll put some more time into it.  It will probably never be as
flexible as noweb itself but I doubt we need all of that flexibility.

Of course, that begs the noweb side of the question, but that's more
complex than notangle and will probably have to wait a bit.

Cheers,
CY

PLEASE PLEASE DO. In fact, since you say that mmm is roughly dead, maybe you
could resurrect it? It is a wunderful thing, apart from those glitches...

I support Martin. It is really annoying that I have to add %$ after the 
end of a code chunk if the code chunk contained an odd number of $'s. 
That only happens in XEmacs. but Martin has similar problems with the 
double quotes although they seem to be paired correctly.

If you or some other on this mailing list could find the bug in mmm-mode 
that would really be wonderful. Martin and me could probably put 
together a demonstration file for this syntax-highlighting problem.

> is this something you think can be used in Axiom?

Yes, I do. This debate has raged before on this list but I
believe that we need a lisp version of noweb for several reasons.
Your opinions may vary.

1) the )compile command needs to understand pamphlets directly
2) we need tighter integration of the interpreter and documentation
3) the build process will eventually be lisp-only (controversy)
4) we need to be able to experiment with pamphlet formats for new ideas
5) noweb slows considerably as the files get larger, apparently due to
   the shell pipe of data from process to process.
   (my work pamphlet is now 6M lines, (4k pages of doc, 67k lines of lisp))

What would you consider as the minimal features required to include
cl-notangle (or cl-noweb as the case may be) in Axiom?  I would like to
know what the key minimal requirements are so I know what to shoot for
first.

> 1) the )compile command needs to understand pamphlets directly

Agreed.

> 2) we need tighter integration of the interpreter and documentation

Not sure quite how that works but it sounds good.

> 3) the build process will eventually be lisp-only (controversy)

This is my main reason for wanting notangle in lisp.  Is the eventual
goal of building in lisp controversial?  My understanding is
all-in-lisp is regarded as the best (most portable) way to handle this
process, but the tools were/are lacking - perhaps with notangle in lisp
(and eventually noweb) we can achieve this.  The only catch is that we
can't be lisp only if we need to build GCL first, but at least once we
have a running lisp everything else can be lisp.  The news that we are
close to replacing old boot with new boot (which is simpler to get
working in ANSI lisp) and an sbcl port are two major pieces of the
puzzle, so I'm trying to add notangle and an asdf based loading system
as the other missing pieces.  

> 4) we need to be able to experiment with pamphlet formats for new
> ideas

Yes - I would like to see the default Axiom pamphlet output a little
different (fancier) than it is now (now there's controversy ;-)

Tim, out of curosity how does this version (suboptimal I know) compare
with noweb on that really large file?  I'm sure the read commands will
be a killer but it shouldn't be piping data around, at least.  (Dunno
if it works in GCL, I've only tested it on sbcl).

Cheers,
CY

I think it's basically that the coloring function for Emacs's syntax
highlighting doesn't skip chunks in mmm-mode when deciding how to
highlight things.  That's what would need to be fixed, and it may be
rather non-trivial (but worthwhile) to fix it.  I have a feeling it may
wind up being the case that mmm-mode serves as a guide for a new
literate programming mode, rather than being a fix to mmm-mode - we
will see.  My major concern is that that behavior of Emacs's syntax
highlighting is not user configurable at all, but I don't know enough
to say.

I've seen it before on the $ symbol, in Emacs.  I'll have a look and
see what can be done, but it may be a slow process.

Dear all,

I keep repeating it.

> > 4) we need to be able to experiment with pamphlet formats for new ideas

BEFORE you start developing new ideas, PLEASE look at ALLPROSE. for example by
checking out aldor-combinat

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
svn co svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk

cd combinat/trunk/combinat

notangle -t8 Makefile.nw > Makefile

make dvi

or

make colored dvi

or, if you have tex4ht installed,

make colored html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It does not make sense to reinvent the wheel. A lot of though has gone into
ALLPROSE, and it proved *very* convenient. Note that aldor-combinat is *not* a
small project. I did use ALLPROSE also for very small projects, by the way. It
just works.


Martin

I just came across

http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=60302&topic=10727

So, who is going to prepare the application for google SOC?

If nobody volonteers, I'll do it. I'd propose a HyperDoc replacement using the
ALLPROSE format.

Martin, I'm failing on the latter command with:

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [grouping levels=255].
\@textcolor #1#2#3->\protect \leavevmode {
                                           \color #1{#2}#3}
l.148 ...YVERSION}}\\{{projectname}{projectname}}}
 
\nwindexuse{LIBRARYVERSION...

Do I need to tweak a texmf.cnf setting or some such?

Cheers,
CY

Interesting.  I had similar (and more) patches like that in my local
tree as of 2006-12-26.  I never committed it because there was a small
catch -- which I can't explain right now because I don't have all the
elements handy :-(  Good to see someone is catching on :-)

I don't know exactly what you have done, and although I have increase my 
pool sizes locally, it is very probably not the reason for the problem.

I guess, there might be something missing on your computer.
Maybe you first install "packaged-allprose" from

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/hemmecke/aldor/allprose/index.html

in particular you should install the newest version of srcltx.sty. 
ALLPROSE needs at least version 1.4. (I have the suspicion that this 
could be the reason for this strange error message.)

Try first srcltx and then packaged-allprose. Then let me know.

Ralf

The patch is more tricky than it looks like: greping for suspected
keywords give tons of false positives and in first shot I missed few
places (and I dicovered that a few more bad keywords).  And I still
use depsys for to translate c-util (trying to use bootsys gives me
some misterious errors).

I have checked that resulting Lisp (output from depsys and interpsys)
is identical (modulo gensymed names) so the patch works reasonably,
but there is still risk of bugs in rarely used code.

In case this triggers a flag for anybody, it looks like this might
be what we need (or mmm-mode needs anyway) to fontify in such a way
that chunks are avoided:

;;; Fontification functions.

;; Rather than the function, e.g., `font-lock-fontify-region' containing
;; the code to fontify a region, the function runs the function whose
;; name is the value of the variable, e.g.,
;; `font-lock-fontify-region-function'.  Normally, the value of this
;; variable is, e.g., `font-lock-default-fontify-region'
;; which does contain the code to fontify a region.  However, the value
;; of the variable could be anything and thus, e.g.,
;;`font-lock-fontify-region' could do anything.  The indirection of the
;; fontification functions gives major modes the capability of modifying
;; the way font-lock.el fontifies.  Major modes can modify the values
;; of, e.g., `font-lock-fontify-region-function',
;; via the variable `font-lock-defaults'.

;; Languages that contain text normally contained in different major
;; modes could define their own fontification functions that treat text
;; differently depending on its context.  For example, Perl mode could
;; arrange that here docs are fontified differently than Perl code.  Or
;; Yacc mode could fontify rules one way and C code another.  Neat!

That sounds like the ticket, now to figure out how to use it!

Included now in wh-sandbox (the Lisp part was not needed, since wh-sandbox
now contains no algebra bootstrap Lisp).

I have tried to use read-sequence to load a file quickly, which works
fine, but I'm afraid I haven't done too well with the problem of
working with the resulting string.  The code so far is actually slower
than the earlier version, and from what I can tell the primary issue
seems to be too many subseq operations on the big one-pamphlet string. 
I tried leaving the string intact and just identifying positions rather
than chopping it off as I scanned, but the searches got progressively
more expensive even though I was supplying new start positions. 
There's probably a better way to do it or an obvious mistake in the way
I have done it, but I'm afraid I've been staring at it a bit too long.

I've posted my MathML package on SandBoxMathML.
I'm still working on both the code and the documentation but
it does work now.  I've also included the diff files needed to
patch Axiom so it can be built with mathml as a new output
form.  There are also a few files to help with viewing the
output in Firefox.

Fast way to scan strings is to use finite automaton.  The code below
shows how this can be done in Lisp. 

Notes:
- This is a proof of concept (probably buggy) code, in particular I
  only extract the  main chunk (do not handle rescannig for other
  chunks).  Rescannig can be done by similar code, which simulatneously
  could handle @-escapes ("@<<" etc).  If escapes are not supported one
  could do with a single scan, extending automaton to remember positions
  of embedded tags.  Alternative way to have single scan is to
  copy content to new array during scan handling escapes during
  copy.
- AFAICS this code is faster then Debian (pretty fast) notangle.
  I belive that after adding needed features it can still be
  fast.
- I use (unsigned-byte  8) as a type because Lisp implementation
  may choose to have Unicode character and perfrom complicated
  recoding during input and output.  Also, Unicode characters
  are likely to require more storage (so more time for memory
  access and for garbage collection).
- The main function 'scan-for-chunks' is a rat nest of gotos.
  But that is correct because finite automaton _is_ a rat nest
  of transition and one of the simplest ways to implement
  transitions is to use gotos.  One can make it shorter by
  using apropritate macros.  Ideally the automaton code should
  be mechanically generated -- writing in C I would use flex
  (the task is trivial for flex, but no so trivial by hand).
- For ultimate speed pamplets should be read directly by Spad
  scanner.  This would avoid duplicate work.  Namely, Spad have
  to scan the file anyway.  Recoginzing noweb markers adds
  only little complexity to scanner and (if implemented via
  finite automaton) almost no execution time.  Spad performs
  macro expansion and the same mechanizm can substitute chunks
  if they respect pile rules.  If one really wants unstructured
  chunks one can handle them redirection parser input (like
  include files).
- Re-doing Spad scanning/parsing is on my todo list.  But ATM
  parsing works no worse than the rest of compiler and while
  quite slow it is still one of the fastest parts in the compiler.
  So this task has very low priority.

Perhaps they could be prototyped in flex and then mapped to the Lisp
macro system?

This raises a question for me - I know Tim has need of a very fast
notangle for his work, but does Axiom actually need this kind of speed?
 The complexity of this code makes me wonder of the extra 30 seconds in
Axiom build time are worth the added obfuscation.  I suppose if we get
the macros written it won't be so formidible though...

I did a little bit of analysis, which Waldek's work makes more or less
moot but I'll add on anyway in case it winds up being of use to someone
else who is interested in basic profiling.  One point - unless I'm
misunderstanding what the finite automaton solution is, this analysis
actually does point in the correct optimization direction - which is to
say, not read-line or reading speed but rather string manipulation
speed.  Perhaps similar (but more advanced) study will wind up being
useful for other parts of Axiom.

Among the interesting features of sbcl, it turns out there is a neat
little utility called sb-profile that lets one watch how much time
functions take over time.  I tried it using v0.3 of the cl-notangle,
and it is suggesting that it's not only (or even primarily) read-line
that is taking the time.

Here's what I did:

SETUP> (load "/home/cyapp/cl-notangle-v0.3.lisp")
T
SETUP> (sb-profile:profile MAKE-NEW-CHUNK GET-CHUNK-CONTENTS
ADD-TO-CHUNK-CONTENTS READ-IN-CHUNK CHECK-FOR-TOPLEVEL-CHUNK
CHECK-FOR-REFERENCED-CHUNK LOAD-PAMPHLET-FILE WRITE-OUTPUT-FILE)
; No value

That sets up the profiling on the defined functions.  I then run my
benchmark test, which is essentially all of boot and interp:

SETUP> (load "./setup/runlispnotangle.lisp")
T

This takes anywhere from 10 to 13 seconds, bases on earlier testing. 
Looking at the report:

SETUP> (sb-profile:report)

interesting things immediately jump out - the majority of the read-line
calls are in read-in-chunk and load-pamphlet-file, but they account for
only about half the time.  Admittedly that's already as long as noweb
takes to finish the job, but the real killer is
CHECK-FOR-REFERENCED-CHUNK.  So, since read-line was the initial
suspect, we take the instrumenting one step further and add some more
basic functions:

SETUP> (sb-profile:reset)
NIL
SETUP> (sb-profile:profile read-line string-equal concatenate search)
; No value

We run the identical test:

SETUP> (load "./setup/runlispnotangle.lisp")
T

and get a new report:

Ah - concatenate by itself takes about as long as noweb does to do the
complete job.  search and read-line together take less than 3s,  and
are called a combined total of over 300k times to concatenate's less
than 12k.  This seems to suggest read-line, while slower than
read-sequence, is not yet the limiting factor.

Unfortunately, unless someone knows of a library that implements the
type of system Waldek is talking about, it looks like there is some
work ahead to implement the best of all possible notangles.  I may go
ahead and use the less efficient one for the moment to try other things
like teaching asdf to read pamphlet files, and when we are ready to go
"live" we can try for high end optimization targets.  Waldek (if you
made it this far), how much work do you think is involved with setting
up the full polished system?  Also, can you recommend some background
reading on the technique you're describing?

Cheers, and thanks!

Arthur,

Thank you very much for this contribution! I think this will
be very important for the development of new users interfaces
for Axiom. At the moment I am bogged down with other activities
but I plan to install your patches in my version of Axiom soon
and give this a test run.

Perhaps we can also install this on the Axiom Wiki web server
so that MathML output can be viewed directly in the Wiki. Last
time I tried this (with the Reduce MathML interface) I ran into
problems with forcing the Wiki to generate the correct headers
for web pages that contain MathML. Do you know of any way to
embed MathML into HTML that does not (quite) conform to the
XHTML standard?

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. You might notice that I added your mathml.spad pamphlet as
a page on the Wiki (see link on left sidebar of SandBoxMathML)
so now you can see the documentation and code online.

Bill,

As far as I know the following is the "correct" way to embed mathml into
xhtml.  The file needs to have the extension xml or xhtml.  html doesn't
work (in Firefox), I guess however that if delivering the page with a
web server the content type could be set so that the file extension
wouldn't matter.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN"
                     
"http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/xhtml-math11-f.dtd" >
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>MathML Test </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" mathsize="big"
display="block">
      <msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>
    </math>
  </body>
</html>

This also works, again with file extension  xml or xhtml.

<html>
  <body>
    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" mathsize="big"
display="block">
      <msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup>
    </math>
  </body>
</html>

Yes!

<grin>  ask a silly question...  OK, I'll keep trying to follow what
Waldek is doing.

OK...  Hmm.  What about this - I already have taught sbcl how to run
the  external notangle command for some previous work.  What if we set
it up that the lisp notangle command first looks for the external
notangle and tries to run it, but failing that falls back to the
internal one?  That way, we can make use of a pre-installed noweb if
it's available, and if that fails fall back on the lisp version. 
If/when we get a faster one we simply reverse the order in which the
options are tried.  For that matter, we can add the perl one to the
list as well - I've never benchmarked that one so I can't say how fast
it is.

For the case where noweb isn't already installed, I guess it's a
question of whether the increased time of cl-notangle is greater than
the time it takes to build the regular noweb.  I haven't timed the
noweb build so I'm not sure - I don't think the 7 second difference for
boot+interp would do it but of course the real volume is in the algebra
source files which I've not yet tried.

I guess another question is whether Axiom is set up so that ./configure
can build only noweb and nothing else on request.

Cheers,
CY

Camm,

I'm building the next Axiom release. During the GCL build I see a large
number of messages that read:

gcl_defmacro.c:In function `L12':
gcl_defmacro.c:79: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will
 break strict-aliasing rules

C99 language semantics now assume that pointers to different types
point to different memory locations, which is obvious nonsense, but
part of the new standard.

You might want to add -fno-strict-aliasing option to the GCC command line.
The alternative fix is to embed a (void *) between your cast and your
thing thus:

  x = (yourcast)(void *)thing

Tim

Below is a newer version of CL notangle, this time handling recursive
references.  There are still significant differences compared to
real notangle (lack of @ escapes, different end of line handling, ...).
I also fixed performace problem in scan-for-chunks (previous version
was using 'equal' and sbcl emited actual call to 'equal', current
version uses 'eql' which generates inline code).  Another performance
problem was using arrays of bytes as hash keys (completly killed
performance for pamphlets with many small chunks, or chunks
split into many small pieces).  I solved this problem converting
arrays to strings before hashing.

This version seem to be significantly faster than notangle: it is able
to process simple 8 Mb file (containing few big chunks) in 0.14s while
notangle needs 2s.  On 8Mb file containing 1000 chunks, each consisting
of 100 pieces 10 lines each, my version needs 0.24s, while notangle
uses 2.85s. 

BTW. Timing was done on 2GHz Athlon 64.  Notangle came from Axiom build,
Lisp is sbcl 1.0.  I tried also clisp, but it is quite slow (need 8.73
senconds on my second test file) -- no wonder since I use a low level
code.  This version (like the previous one) does not work with gcl
(ANSI 2.6.5 interpreter claims that 'read-sequence' is undefined,
non-ANSI interpreter chokes on 'defclass').

Unforunately, I am a lisp illiterate. :-( So I don't even know how to 
start your program on test files. So I would like to give a little 
(meaningless) testfile.

The output of notangle on the program below is

----------------------
foo(x: Integer): Integer == z := 1
                             for i in 1.. x repeat
                                 h := 1
                                 for j in 1..i repeat
                                     h := h + j
                                     h := 2*h
                                 h := if h > 100
                                        then
                                          h-2
                                        else
                                          h+2
                                 h := 3*h
                                 z := h
                             z
----------------------

Does your program give the same result?

Furthermore what about the option "-L" that can be given to notangle?
That is particularly useful if your compiler emits a column number for 
error messages. #pile mode is bad in that case anyway, but there are 
also files that are indentation-independent.

Well, we probably don't actually need the full power of noweb notangle
- I think it makes more sense to enforce sane pamphlet writing style
instead (improves human readability, for that matter - stays
consistent).

By lack of @ escapes, do you mean that any @ in the file is treated as
the end of a code chunk, e.g. no awareness of position?  (e.g. it won't
be able to process itself as a pamphlet?)  From what I saw earlier the
only two things that are really needed are recognizing an illegal chunk
name due to newline inclusion (you may not even need that one the way
you've defined your start and end chars) and making sure @ is right
after a newline (at least for parsing Axiom files, which is the main
goal.)  I'll have a go at it later and see how it behaves.

Wow.  VERY impressive work.  One question Waldek - I'm willing to try
to convert this code into a literate document for purposes of Axiom
inclusion, but I fear I'm not competent to describe these issues and
reasons for specific choices.  I'll take a stab at it using your emails
as a starting point (indeed, that might be a good way to ensure the
documentation covers enough for other clueless beginners) but are you
up for a few painfully ignorant questions? ;-)

Also, are you OK with the modified BSD license for this?  It's
essentially all your code at this point so I don't want to presume.

You may have just become the poster child for those trying to debunk
the "lisp is slow" myth ;-).

Um.  Clisp doesn't surprise me, and normally if speed is a concern
people don't run on Clisp anyway.  I also ran into the defclass thing
on GCL - perhaps we could use defstruct instead?  I don't know that
there's any particular reason to use CLOS other than convenience and
trying to be "modern".

Cheers, and thanks again for some really excellent work!

If you have sbcl you can do (assuming that you have saved the program
int the file "nono2.lisp"):

(load "nono2.lisp")
(untangle "input.file" "output.file")

For timing:
(time (untangle "input.file" "output.file"))

Other Lisps require extra commands to compile the code but at least
up to version 1.0 sbcl automatically compiles the code.

No.  First I have noticed that notangle behaves in rather inconsitent
way.  I do not want to waste time trying to find out exact rules used
by notangle.  With pile semantics it seems better to integrate
notangle like processing with Spad scanning and treat each hunk as
a pile (IMHO having piles spanning hunk boundary is just confusing
and error prone).

To supporting such feature would require storing information about
all line endings.  This is not very hard, but I do not want to
invest much more time in this program unless other find it useful.
Also note that the reason to use Lisp is so that the program can
run inside Axiom process.  For external program I would use C
which probably would be faster to write and would give faster
program.  Note that this is not intended to be a general remark
about languages: I simply know C better (most of the time for
writing program was actually spent in CL manuals), I know C tools
for scanning, I have a collection of C utility routines which
make the task easier.

That could be easily addedd: the program traces line numbers anyway
(for debugging purposes) so it would be easy to store them together
with chunks and emit when needed.

both <<auxiliary computation>> and <<binding z>> change h without
any hint about such possibility in <<foo body>>.  I find such
practice _very_ bad for readability.

Really? I've met some cases where notangle does not as I would like, but 
these cases are rare.

Of course, I would also forbid the equivalent way of saying

<<*>>=
foo(): () == {
    some code
@
some doc
<<*>>=
    some more code
}
@

But the code I gave was not of that style.

But you know that then notangle doesn't indentate? If you remove the 
#line lines from the output of "notangle -L ..." you don't get the same 
output as "notangle ...". And this is actually a good thing. I once 
complaint about the missing indentation, but Norman refused to change 
the behaviour and he is right.

Of course that was just a cooked up example for the indentation problem. 
What I like is code like...

<<implementation: gosperForm>>=
gosperForm(f: P, g: P): (P, P, P) == {
     import from FractionalRoot Integer;
     import from Integer;
     nonNegativeIntegerRoots: Generator Integer := {
         <<nonnegative integers $h$ with $\gcd(f(n),g(n+h))\ne1$>>
     }
     <<build up the Gosper triple $(p, q, c)$>>
     (p, q, c)
}
@

<<non-negative integers $h$ with $\gcd(f(n),g(n+h))\ne1$>>=
r: UPh := resultant(lift(f), lift(g)(n+h::UPhn));
v for i in integerRoots r | (v:=integralValue i) > 0;
@

<<build up the Gosper triple $(p, q, c)$>>=
c:P := 1;
p := f;
q := g;
for root in nonNegativeIntegerRoots repeat {
	u:P := gcd(p, q(x + root::P));
	p := quotient(p, u);
	q := quotient(q, u(x - root::P));
	for j in 1..root repeat c := c*u(x - j::P);
}
@

... and even that could be improved. (I omitted the latex part.)

Anyway, I don't claim that I know the best way to write literate programs.

Ralf, I take it what you expect, based on your example, is
that notangle will "fill in" the pile spacing used by each
chunk in the output?  Is this default behavior or does it
need an option?

I must say I'm a bit confused - my original thought was that
all notangle had to do was get the code out of the chunks
"as is" line by line and stuff it into the output file in
the right order.  Can you point me to a couple examples of using
-L and what its effects/utility are?  (Sorry if they're in the
archives - I can try digging later.)

I've been reading over Waldek's code and I think I understand
what he is up to now, so I'll see what I can do with it - I can
see where automatic generation of some of this code via macro
would be a Good Thing.

Waldek, I'm not sure if others will find it useful but I do intend
to use it to try and make asdf load pamphlet files transparently.
(or more correctly, load code from pamphlet files.)  I really appreciate
the time you've put into this and I for one have learned something
from it :)

Cheers,
CY

Look at the following C program:
<<*>>=
int
fun(int x)
{
   return (x@<<8) | (x>>8);
}
@
<<8) | (x>>=
+
@

Normal notangle gives:

int
fun(int x)
{
   return (x<<8) | (x>>8);
}

while CL version gives:

int
fun(int x)
{
   return (x@+8);
}

Without the "8) | (x" chunk CL notangle would just halt on error.

Sure, I prefer to omit license from files to avoid clutter, but use
the code any way you wish.  For Axiom distribution probably putting
a single line like "For legal info see Axiom.Licence" could be a good
compromise between beetween legal pedantry and practicality.

Do not be too eager with this.  It is clear that even for strings
hashtables take a lot of time.  We are forced to do an otherwise
useless copy to string to avoid huge slowdon.  And in the main
loop the code is clearly worse then the code from a C compiler.
So the program is probably faster than similar Perl or Python
programs, but slower than good C version.

Yes, defstruct should be enough.  'read-sequence' (and I guess also
'write-sequence') causes more problems, because performance depends on
it.  For gcl we probably must provide our own (calling C) versions.

Getting the indentation right is the default behaviour. But it can get 
rather complicated.

---BEGIN aaa.spad.pamphlet
<<*>>=
<<blah>><<foo>>
         bar
@
<<blah>>=
x
  XX
@
<<foo>>=
y
  YY
@
---END aaa.spad.pamphlet

What would you expect? Perhaps
=================
x
  XXy
          YY
         bar
=================
??? That is what I get with

notangle aaa.spad.pamphlet

Contrary to that with

notangle -L'#line %L "aaa.spad.pamphlet"%N' aaa.spad.pamphlet

I get

=============================
#line 7 "aaa.spad.pamphlet"
x
  XX
#line 11 "aaa.spad.pamphlet"
y
  YY
#line 4 "aaa.spad.pamphlet"
         bar
=============================

I know you have downloaded Aldor-Combinat. After saying "make dvi"
you find two types of .as files under the src directory.

series.as   -- generated without -L option
csseries.as -- generated with -L option.

Ignore the +++ comments since they are missing in the files that are not 
prefixed by cs.

But generally the indentation with -L is *exactly* as in the original 
source i.e. the .pamphlet/.nw file.

Suppose that your program contains an arbitrary sequence of '@', '<<'
and '>>'.  Do you know how to write the source file to get required
output?  I did not want to waste time on this problem, but a few
trials gave rather bizzare results.

Your example suggest that notangle is consistent in its indentation
rules, but if you take "random" input the results look strange.

Also, I thought that notagle is inconsistent in it treatment of
tabs (sometimes mangles then, but preserves leading tabs in Makefiles),
but it seems that normaly notagle consistently mangles tabs and
just needs extra option to preserve tabs.

ATM CL version also do not indentate.  It puts first char of the chunk
in the same line as <<xxx>> marker, but of course printing '#line' we
can also emit a newline before it.

I am asking to understand which features of notangle are useful.  Would
you need notangle for a programming language where by default input is
a comment, all code must be in procedures/functions, you can write
procedures in arbitrary order and you can have arbitrary procedure names
(but with special begin/end name markers).
In such language your example could look like:

<<implementation: gosperForm>>(f: P, g: P): (P, P, P)=
      import from FractionalRoot Integer;
      import from Integer;
      nonNegativeIntegerRoots: Generator Integer := {
          <<nonnegative integers $h$ with $\gcd(f(n),g(n+h))\ne1$>>(f, g, h)
      }
      <<build up the Gosper triple $(p, q, c)$>>
      (p, q, c)
@

<<non-negative integers $h$ with $\gcd(f(n),g(n+h))\ne1$>>(f, g, h)=
r: UPh := resultant(lift(f), lift(g)(n+h::UPhn));
v for i in integerRoots r | (v:=integralValue i) > 0;
@
....

That would be less flexible that notangle because of need for explicit
parameter passing, but at least for me having explicit parameters 
(and explicit scopes) makes text more readable.

Don't worry - I'm not usually one to get involved with language
wars anyway.  But I think by any measure we would want to worry
about this result is excellent - after all, notangle as a percentage
of the total build time looks to be pretty small, so at some point
the time put in to optimize further reaches diminishing returns.
This solution should integrate well with Axiom, perform very well,
and can be expanded upon for other uses (like the SPAD compiler).

Thanks for all the effort to fix my original code - I'll see if
I can make defstruct work and get something that will do for
GCL as well.

(One question - I thought read-sequence was part of the ANSI
Common Lisp spec?  Is it just that GCL hasn't implemented it yet?
Of course it's not so critical since we aren't running on the
ANSI image yet anyway.)

Cheers,
CY

Dear all,

sorry about asking a FAQ...

Tomorrow I will have to install Axiom on a MS Windows machine for a very
renowned professor who wants to use my guessing package.

Is there anything I should be aware of? Is Windows version 0.1.4 the current
version? Is there any way to make hyperdoc, i.e., the "browse" functionality,
available under windows?

I guess wh-sandbox does not run under windows? (Bill said, build-improvements
does...)

Martin

Yes - current as of 2 years ago. :-(

No, not at present. I think the best way of supporting hyperdoc
on Windows is to use Microsoft Virtual PC (or VMware, both are
free) and install a linux system on the virtual machine, then
install Axiom, e.g. wh-sandbox. I use Virtual PC extensively.
It works very well - especially if you have at least a dual-core
machine and enough ram (at least 1 Gb.). If you need help with

Yes, I have successfully built build-improvments on Windows.
Of course since there is no X-windows environment of Windows,
hyperdoc and graphics are not built.

wh-sandbox was branched from build-improvements before the
ability to build on Windows was added so, no, I don't think
wh-sandbox will build on Windows at this time. It would be nice
if Waldek or Gaby could merge the build-improvements branch
with the wh-sandbox branch. If they could do that, I think
it would form a very good basis for a new Axiom Silver
distribution.

Bill Page.

Waldek is more familiar with wh-sandbox than me, so I would pass the
ball to him :-)

However, there are other experiments in wh-sandbox that we should
discuss before we consider it basis for Axiom Silver.  That discussion
surely would be long and intense; so I would prefer Waldek works more
on it before we get to that point.

Bill, is that result something we could wrap up in the NSIS installer
and push out as a release?

Maybe as an alternative to command-line-only we could bundle ntemacs
and the Emacs mode, and rig it to start that up when the icon is
clicked?  Axiom is big enough that a few more megs probably won't break
anybody's back, and we could always provide a "no-emacs" binary if
someone wanted it.

When I tested emacs mode + Axiom on Windows it did succeed, give or
take a bug in turning input red when it is changed.  (the latest cvs
emacs build fixed it but I doubt we would want to distribute that.)
 
Unfortunately, I don't have access to a Windows box so I'm not much
help on this issue :-(.

Cheers,
CY

Well, I actually intended to bulk-merge changes to build-improvements
but some changes (like removal of DESTDIR) look backwards, some other
changes (src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet and src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet)
are from my point of view mostly irrelevant (due to new algebra
bootstrap).  In general many changes looks like incomplete transitions
(was there any reason not to ansify graph subdirectory?).  I could
probably just pick changes needed for Windows build.  But I decided
to not do so for two reasons:
- it would make full merge harder
- it is rather incovenint for me to test on Windows

Let me summarize main changes in wh-sandbox:

1) removal of unused code from compiler/interpreter
2) translating depsys using Shoe and removal of depsys bootstrap Lisp
3) new algebra bootstrap and removal of algebra bootstrap Lisp
4) mechanical generation of (most of) .pht pages
5) hyperdoc and algebra fixes
6) removal of useless files
7) pretty-printing of intermediate files and asq rewrite
8) adding guessing package written by Martin Rubey

Given change may be split into multiple commits, but looking at change
log should be clear how to categorize commits.  Somebody making a
release may prefer to pick only bug fixes (position 5) or maybe
also guessing package.  To large degree this should be possible since
(IIRC) only some documentation fixes depend on generation of .pht pages
(and one can just pick the newly generated pages), otherwise fixes do not
depend on structural changes.  OTOH I consider structural changes
essential for future Axiom maintenance.  I plan much deeper structural
changes, but IMHO they already give significant benefits.  There
are some costs, for example new algebra bootstrap takes more time than
the old one.  I feel reasonably confident that changes I made work
correctly so if I was making a release I would include them.

It is a mistake to defined DESTDIR in a Makefile.  The solution
I implemented in the build-improvements was a mild fix.  The real
fix is to remove the definition.  Which is what happened.

[...]

| 1) removal of unused code from compiler/interpreter

I'm nervous about code removal when I have not understood beyond "it
is dead code".  It does not mean I'm opposed to it.  I'm saying I'd
like to understand why the code is removed.

Below is a little utility that I use to compare Lisp files produced
by Axiom.  Axiom uses uninterned (gensymed) symbols in its output.
Such sumbols are printed like '#:G706711' where the numbers depend
on computation history.  When Lisp is reading the file the numbers
does not matter at all -- what matter is if two such symbols are
equal (which is marked in special way) or different.  When comparing
files as texts different numbering of gensymed symbols give a lot
of spuriouos differences.  The program below can discard most such
differences (it does not recurse into arrays, so it may sometimes
show difference for textually identical files).

Note that this _not_ a polished code, just something that other may
find useful (comments show how the code may be called).  BTW, I use
the Lisp code via a shell wrapper:

       --eval '(make-package "BOOT")' \

Another technique that significantly improves the speed of lisp
code is the use of declarations. In general, a function call in 
lisp has to have a case statement of the possible types of each
argument and needs to handle the possible types. However, if you
tell the compiler what the argument types are and the return types
are you can get significantly faster code. The best way to illustrate
this is to use the DISASSEMBLE function which will show you the code
that gets laid down by the lisp compiler. CMUCL and SBCL are very
good at optimizing code. GCL also does an excellent job. That's what
the .fn files are for in Axiom.

So, if you have a function + and you say:
   (+ a b)
the compiler cannot assume that a or b are anything so it has to
check for arguments such as lists. 

You can improve the calling code by using THE... as in
  (+ (the integer a) (the integer b))

Lisp can optimize a bit further if you know that the arguments will
always be less than a machine-sized integer, called a FIXNUM. Then
you can say:

  (+ (the fixnum a) (the fixnum b))

However you haven't told the compiler that the result will not
exceed a machine fixnum. You can do this with:

  (the fixnum (+ (the fixnum a) (the fixnum b)))

And now the compiler can improve the function call, potentially 
even inlining the + operation and reducing it to a single machine
add instruction. It can assume that the add will get two machine
sized integers and return a machine-sized result without overflow.

Type declarations can cause a huge speed improvement. CMUCL and
SBCL have amazing optimizing compilers that use type information well.

GCL can automatically generate the type information for all of
the functions in a file. If you first load the GCL file, gcl_collectfn.lsp
and then tell the compiler to emit the type definitions you'll get a .fn
file. So the sequence for optimizing is:

(load "gcl_collectfn.lsp")
(compiler::emit-fn t)
(compile-file "yourfile.lisp")
(load "yourfile.fn")
(compile-file "yourfile.lisp")

The first compile-file will generate the .fn, which contains the type
info (and you can hand-augment this if you like), and the second compile-file
will generate much faster code. Once you know this type information you can
hand code it in your original source file and eliminate the collectfn step.

You can do global declarations using PROCLAIM and DECLARE.

The program I posted uses declarations.  AFAICS sbcl has enough 
information about types, from the declarations I gave it can infer
the rest (in my experiance gcl needs much more declarations).
When I wrote that the code could be faster I examined also output
of dissasemble.  The following snippet:

       normal-start
         (incf pos)
         (incf line-number)
         (if (>= pos end-buff)
             (return-from scan-for-chunks))
         (setf code (aref buff pos))
         (if (eql code start-tag-code-1)
             (go chunk-start-tag-1))
         (if (eql code newline-code)
             (go normal-start))
         (go normal)

corresponds to the following assembly code:

;     2AF4: L1:   488B4DD0         MOV RCX, [RBP-48]
;     2AF8:       4883C108         ADD RCX, 8
;     2AFC:       48894DD0         MOV [RBP-48], RCX
;     2B00:       488B55D0         MOV RDX, [RBP-48]
;     2B04:       488B45C8         MOV RAX, [RBP-56]
;     2B08:       488B48F9         MOV RCX, [RAX-7]
;     2B0C:       488B45C8         MOV RAX, [RBP-56]
;     2B10:       4839D1           CMP RCX, RDX
;     2B13:       0F86ED0B0000     JBE L48
;     2B19:       48C1FA03         SAR RDX, 3
;     2B1D:       488B45C8         MOV RAX, [RBP-56]
;     2B21:       480FB64C1001     MOVZX RCX, BYTE PTR [RAX+RDX+1]
;     2B27:       48C1E103         SHL RCX, 3
;     2B2B:       4883F950         CMP RCX, 80
;     2B2F:       0F840F090000     JEQ L34
;     2B35:       EBBD             JMP L1

Why this code is far from optimal?  First, sbcl failed to allocate
variables to registers.  FYI I use AMD64 machine and sbcl in principle
can use 14 general purpose registers (there is 16 registers, but two,
stack pointer RSP and base pointer RBP are used bu sbcl).  The
'scan-for-chunks' function has 11 variables, so it does not look very
hard to allocate _all_ variables into registers.  But apparently sbcl
not only failed to keep variables in registers, it also reloads value
which is still available in register.  Second, there are useless shifts
-- variable code is always used in comparison with (constant) integers
and pos is mostly used in integer operations (it is also stored in
lists).

As a compiler writer I can understand why sbcl is unable to produce
better code.  But I would not call it excellent.

OK, my mistake -- after quick scanning I thought that you removed
DESTDIR support.  Now I see that you implemented correct handling.

Hello,

I have just built wh-sandbox and found a _serious_ bug. It's present in
Build-improvement too (and probably Gold). Last time, I uploaded a
binary version of Axiom I made an error, I added the function 'reroot'
just before the uploading and this function is wrong, at least in the
version on which I'm working. The problem is that at startup the
"current directory" is incorrectly set and if you compile a file it will
compile the one in your home directory instead of the one in the current
directory (if the "basenames" are identical). This issue can mess up the
build process (it happened with build-improvement (version 395)).

There is another problem with file (fixed in wh-sandbox): probe-file no
longer works on directory. Tim I think you should take care of these
issues if you plan to release a new version of Gold, several persons
already reported problems related to this one (with fixes too I
believe).

Greg

PS: See reroot (bookvol5), make-input-filename (nlib.lisp) etc...

the /home/greg/temp directory exists.

Greg

PS : Bill, in the bug report that you sent me, you mention two bugs but
I think there was only one bug, )cd without parameter changes the
working directory to $HOME ($HOMEPATH on Windows I think) :


(1) -> )sys cd
C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\My Documents

---> The current system path is correct.

(1) -> )cd
   The current AXIOM default directory is
      C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.ASUS\
     =20
---> This current directory is wrong. So this file is not found.

Althought this is not directly about Axiom, it might be of interest
to note that Sage does include an interface to Axiom as well as
several other computer algebra systems. I think it is remarkable
that a system that is less than two years old is already the basis
of a new book - even if the author of the book is also the (primary)
author of the system.

Modular Forms, a Computational Approach
William Stein

The leading expert in computations with modular forms demystifies
this process with practical algorithms . free software is available

Review

This marvellous and highly original book fills a significant gap in
the extensive literature on classical modular forms. This is not
just yet another introductory text to this theory, though it could
certainly be used as such in conjunction with more traditional
treatments. Its novelty lies in its computational emphasis
throughout: Stein not only defines what modular forms are, but shows
in illuminating detail how one can compute everything about them in
practice. This is illustrated throughout the book with examples from
his own (entirely free) software package SAGE, which really bring the
subject to life while not detracting in any way from its theoretical
beauty. The author is the leading expert in computations with modular
forms, and what he says on this subject is all tried and tested and
based on his extensive experience. As well as being an invaluable
companion to those learning the theory in a more traditional way,
this book will be a great help to those who wish to use modular forms
in applications, such as in the explicit solution of Diophantine
equations. There is also a useful Appendix by Gunnells on extensions
to more general modular forms, which has enough in it to inspire many
PhD theses for years to come. While the book's main readership will
be graduate students in number theory, it will also be accessible to
advanced undergraduates and useful to both specialists and non-
specialists in number theory.

--John E. Cremona, University of Nottingham

William Stein is an associate professor of mathematics at the
University of Washington at Seattle. He earned a PhD in mathematics
from UC Berkeley and has held positions at Harvard University and
UC San Diego. His current research interests lie in modular forms,
elliptic curves, and computational mathematics.

Oh, for the "glory days" of Axiom when Axiom might have been the
tool of choice for this type of work!

I think that's a great idea - especially if we also merge the bug
fixes from wh-sandbox.

If you would like to do this, please let me know. I would be glad
to help. Compiling the windows version is described on the Axiom
Wiki. Using NSIS to package the result is very easy.

Bill Page.

It would be great if you could package my guessing package, too. It is quite
annoying needing access to somebody's computer just to have it installed. (I
succeeded, though)

Another thing: is Aldor working with wh-sandbox / build improvements?

It is quite possible that I will have a chance to present Ralf's and my work at
the "Seminaire Lotharingien" end of march. Would be nice to have cd's as
giveaways...

As you know, Waldek has added your integer sequence guessing
package to wh-sandbox, however wh-sandbox has not yet been
shown to build on Windows. I doubt that wh-sandbox will build
on Windows at this time since it was branched from an earlier
version of build-improvements before the Windows build was
possible. There are changes needed specifically to avoid trying
to build the components dependent on X-windows.

On the other hand wh-sandbox now uses a much better algebra
bootstrap method which makes it simpler to add new algebra which
build-improvements doesn't have yet. This might complicate things
until/when Gaby and Waldek manage to merge these two developments.
I recall the problems you had trying to add GUESS to the Axiom
Gold distribution.

Were you able to install GUESS on the Windows version of Axiom?

Aldor, oh Aldor, will you ever be free?

Aldor does work with build-improvemnts. (That is what we are
currently using on the Axiom Wiki server.) I am not sure about
wh-sandbox (because of the change in bootstrap method) but I
believe that it should be quite easy to install Aldor on that
version too since basically, Aldor support is just added on
top.

Do you mean something like the Doyen LiveCD? Perhaps we need
to encourage Alfredo to produce a new version...

Yes. In fact, that's the greatest pain of all: no HyperDoc on Windows.

Yes, it's trivial - apart from the fact that it takes roughly half an hour to
compile. But I cannot expect anybody to start with axiom by learning how to
compile a package. Well, I could really provide an input file "compile.input"
and another one "load.input". Still, I'd like it better if it was included.

Yes. But, as you remarked above, no Guessing package with Gold. And no
Aldor. I'd need both, plus ALLPROSE, plus aldor-combinat.

I made wh-sandbox available on my linux box for other members of the
departement by setting the file permissions of

~/axiom

(the install directory) appropriately. However, it seems that axiom wants the
build directory to be availble. I received the following notice:

Apart from these minor glitches, wh-sandbox is working very well, it seems!
Thank you,

Martin

No encouragement needed just more time :-).

Please let me know what Axiom "version" should I use or if I should
wait for a possible new Silver (build-improvements + wh-sandbox).

One possibility for those that need hyperdoc on Windows is using
vmware + Doyen.

Sorry Martin about not having the CD ready for your presentation last
time. By the way, I don't know if it was ever addressed the problem with Gold
patch 50 that would break HyperDoc when adding Martin's package.

Regards,

Alfredo

I consider that your report and that of Gregory are related and fall

Dear all,

I'm discussing with Christian Aistleitner unit testing in Axiom, and I
wondered, how the regression tests are currently run. I only found the .input
files, but cannot find any files containing the corresponding "should be"
output.

Furthermore, how is "should be" and "is" currently compared?

Martin

Well, my personal opinion is that it is no good to wait. We
should use the best of what we have right now. What that might
be 6 months from now, it is hard to tell. Open source projects
like Axiom really do not have schedules and resources like in
the commercial world; it all depends on personal initiative and
how much people are willing and able to give to others.

For a new Linux distribution of Axiom I favour wh-sandbox. It has
the greatest and most significant number of fixes and improvements
as far as the end user is concerned. Waldek has done a great job
of repairing and even completing parts of Hyperdoc that never were
resolved in the "commerical" version. I have never liked hyperdoc
much because I found it so unstable and the gui rather dry and ugly,
but the new wh-sandbox version is changing my mind a little - because
it actally works. Waldek has also corrected a number of significant
bugs in the algebra and added Martin's GUESS package.

For a new Windows distribution of Axiom hyperdoc is not an issue
since there is no available hyperdoc version for Windows, but the
build procedure that does not assume X-windows is important, so our
best choice right now is build-improvements.

Merging the downstream algebra bug fixes from wh-sandbox back into
build-improvements is only a matter of using svn to pick and apply
the appropriate revisions from the repository. If I some how find
a few minutes of the next week, perhaps I can do that. Merging the
GUESS build changes might be a bit more challenging.

Even if no one gets a chance to do any merging, building a new
Windows version from build-improvements is still worth it because
build-improvements is based on Axiom Gold (patch-50) while the
current windows build is two years old and based on about patch-30
or something like that and an older version of GCL.

The procedure I use for wh-sandbox is as follows.  First, when a change
is developed I use ad hoc methods to verify that the change is having
intended effect typically going trough many iterations.  When I am
satisfied with change I do a full build and compare test output and
generated .pht pages.  For recent changes to algebra bootstrap and to
interpreter (switch from boot to Shoe) I also compared generated Lisp.

I do not consider any version as "should be" -- I simply monitor changes.
I compare with previous versions, typically with the preceeding one,
but sometimes also with older versions.

I compare .pht pages just using diff.  For .output files I use a script
that I recently posted.  For lisp files I have a special Lisp comparator
program (also recently posted).

I tried to use random expressions for testing but there are few problems
- my first attempt generated a lot of invalid expressions (like divisions
  by zero or type errors)
- the expressions have bad distribution, many are quite trivial but
  the other quickly get too complicated for Axiom to handle
- test runs tend to get trapped in infinite or semi-infinite computations
  or run out of memory (timeouts could help, but some examples _do_ get
  correct answer only after hours of computations)
- big problem is how to find correct answer to compare with test result.
  For indefinite integrals we can just integrate derivatives.  For
  definite integrals (and possibly some other expressions) we may
  compare numerical evaluation of symbolic result with result of 
  numerical integration.  Another possibility is are multi-CAS
  competitions:  compare outputs of different systems.

Oh, I meant, results of computations using axiom...

Yes, that's what I have in mind - although, for the moment, static only. I.e.,
a rather large database of results, which are checked after a change in the
algebra is made

Encouraged by progress made by Greg Vanuxem I decided to retry
my attempt to compile Axiom using sbcl.  One of my main motivators
is problem of long compile times.  It is hard to resolve such
problems without a profiler.  I was unable to profile gcl compiled
programs, while profiling seem to work quite well in sbcl.
FYI I use the following patch to Juergen Weiss version:

http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~hebisch/prog/sbcl-cmu2.diff

Currently Debian sbcl 0.9.16 gives up compiling ALGSC (1.0 after
1 hour is still working), however I collected some timing data.
Namely I used sbcl compiled interpsys to do bootstrap part of
algebra build (like new bootstrap in wh-sandbox).  The profile
shows interesting things. First, compilation is much faster than
using gcl (about 15 minutes on the same machine) .  Most of the
time is spent in Lisp compilation, but we also have a few hot
spots in spad compilation.

Some remarks: This is profile from the third bootstrap stage,
consisting of normal compilation of all categories and about
20 core domains.  Profiles form earlier stages are somwhat
different -- the first stage is much faster, and Lisp compilation
takes smaller part.  The second stage is similar to the third.
I think that third stage is closer to normal compilation
(however, bootstrap compiles only few domains, while rest of
build handles bulk of domains and packages).

I you want I can upload what I have done (more precisely what is
"distributable"), I planned to upload it Sunday but I'm not against this
idea (I'm busy). The bad news is that the interpreter is not
pamphletised [1], I do not think that the documentation must be done
now, it has to be done when merging and when, I think, we have _fixed_
the API (a lot of functions rely on CltL1 (GCL ?) (symbol used to
extensively for example)). WHat I'm saying does not prevent to document,
"conceptually", some part of the "interpreter" such that the database,
the compiler(s) etc...

Greg

[1] The build process is buggy too, somes versions of Make (the one in
Cygwin for example) does not accept the algebra Makefile and its
inclusions.

It would be nice to see your version.  I certainly would like to
know how you solved some specific problems (non-ANSI type declarations,
BPINAME function etc).  I would like also to time build process.

Currently wh-sandbox (and I belive also build-improvements) does not install
gcl files (in this case cmpinclude.h) in target directory.  The simplest
solution is to use system installed gcl (and make sure that gcl _is_
installed on target machine).

Gaby is right that we have mess with paths, but even with correct paths
we still would have problem: we simply do not install the needed include
file.

I think that this file is installed in the target directory
(mnt) in the Axiom Gold release. Right?

After some investigation it turend out that eariler versions do not
need "cmpinclude.h" -- gcl simply puts inline content of this file.
gcl behaviour is controlled by the Lisp compiler::*default-system-p*
variable, which is set to t.  As a workaround one can use the following
in the start script:

)lisp (setf compiler::*default-system-p* nil)

AFAICS the problem was interoduced in version 25 (patch 45): this
variable is set to t when using system installed gcl.  Typically
this is not a problem, but I belive that if somebody builds gold
using system installed gcl (assuming that this would work ...)
and then puts the content of Axiom directory on a machine whithout
installed gcl, then the same problem would appear.

Now, the question is how to solve the problem.  One way is to patch
src/lsp/Makefile.pamphlet so that it does not set 
compiler::*default-system-p* to t.  Another possibility is to
set compiler::*default-system-p* to nil when dumping final AXIOMsys.
For me the second possibility looks slightly better, as it avoids
putting extra crud into intermediate C files.

>From my point of view nicest solution would be to teach gcl check
if cmpinclude.h is in expected place, if yes use it, otherwise
use cached version.

Here are the sources:

http://perso.orange.fr/parabola/axiom-cl.tar.gz

It is based on the work of Juergen Weiss available here:

http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/weiss/axiom_cmu.tgz

(So you can easily diff these to know who did what)

For the question of BPINAME, I have the same problem than you.
When I read your code I was particularly interested in your
implementation of this function. This function is
implemented but further investigations are needed.

For example the=20

((and (consp func) (eq (car func) 'lambda)) (second (third func)))

is probably never used. Furthermore in boot code we can see several
reference to compiled-function-p before using BPINAME, compiled-function-=
p
is really implementation dependant so... I will work on this when time wi=
ll permit.

Anyway there are numerous "TODO" in the code, if some of you want to work=
 on
this port feel free to improve it :-) (when there are "QUESTION" in the c=
ode
this is because further investigation are needed and eventually I'll have=
 to
ask Juergen Weiss why it's implemented this way).=20

To compile it 'cd' to src/boot, edit the Makefile.(sbcl|clisp|cmu) and th=
e Makefile.inc
to change the variables defined if necessary (you'll have, for sure, to m=
odify AXIOMROOT).
Export the AXIOM environment variable so for example with SBCL :

export AXIOM=3D/usr/local/axiom-cl/mnt/sbcl

and use 'make -f Makdefile.sbcl' to build bootsys with SBCL.

Do the same thing for src/interp and src/algebra.

To use Axiom do not forget to export the environment variable AXIOM
(this is necessary for the moment).

The build process has been done in such a way that you can easily build
Axiom for each CL implementation (and test the three at the same time).

And, a last remark (for fun)=20

<Hans Reiser argument>

Original Axiom:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------=

time echo ')r zdsolve' | /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys &>/dev/n=
ull

real    1m24.392s

And there are a lot of other types of remark...

Greg

PS: If you have fix, amelioration etc... please let me know.

PS2: For the "warriors" who want to use Aldor edit foam_l.lisp since
it's specialised for me (the |SInt| type). A better way is to use an inte=
ger
range as type instead of a predefined type such that fixnum. The
other problem is that we don't have the sources so we can not know
what exactly a |Sint| is.)

KNOWN PROBLEMS (not related to Axiom):

 Solution
fix SBCL :-)

(this one is related to the build process of Axiom)
It will be not possible to build the algebra with some version of Make.
This need to be  fixed. The typical error message is something like
"can not load BASTYPE", this type is not available since the correspondin=

.spad file is not compiled). On MinGW-MSYS I have to create the included =

with the "standard" version of make and use the "packaged make" to
build the algebra :-(

I'm working on the next release of Axiom Gold.

Work is being done on Axiom in several different locations
and I've made an effort to harvest those changes that I understand
and to merge, test, and document these changes back into the release.

In open source projects it is important that changes get collected
and packaged so they can be merged with the main release. This
is done by releasing diffs and changesets (the whole point of SVN).
Often the original author is the only one who can diff, document,
test and package these changesets.

The mailing list has almost no patches posted.
Why is that?

Tim

I suspect that the use of compiled-function-p is bogus: Axiom probably
assumes that the function is either given by a lambda list or is
a compiled function.  But it looks that such assumption was true in
the past, but now both compiled and interpreted functions are (represented
by) function objects.  I think that the case you quote above just
tests for archaic representation of interpreted functions.

I hope that Lisp implementation that is capable of finding name of a function
object will return this name as a third value of function-lambda-expression.
However, I noticed that sbcl returns funny things for functions obtained
from lambda expresions so I added a little samity check.  I wonder
how well such implementation works with other Lisps -- in principle
it may be quite portable.

I had apply the following diff to build with  sbcl 0.9.16.  The first
hunks just corrects a typo, the second chunk is a quick hack around the
problem that sb-unix::unix-mkdir accepts only base-string, while we have
a string as an argument.  I did not try building using sbcl 1.0, but
I did check that in sbcl 1.0 sb-unix::unix-mkdir works just with
strings, so probably 1.0 needs no workaround.

Well, patches are supposed to be posted when they are ready for
"prime time" use.  For "personal" experimentation we don't require
that (should we?).

The axiom-commit mailing list has the history of all commits
to SVN -- when they are not truncated due to SF policy.

in the file gcl_cmpmain.lsp we have:

(defun compiler-pass2 (c-pathname h-pathname system-p )
  (declare (special *init-name*))
  (with-open-file (st c-pathname :direction :output)
    (let ((*compiler-output1* (if (eq system-p 'disassemble) *standard-output*
                                st)))
      (declare (special *compiler-output1*))
    (with-open-file (*compiler-output2* h-pathname :direction :output)
      (cond ((and
              (stringp *cmpinclude-string*)
              (not system-p)
              (si::fwrite *cmpinclude-string* 0
                          (length *cmpinclude-string*) *compiler-output1*)))
            (t (wt-nl1 "#include " *cmpinclude*)))

So, if system-p argument to compiler-pass2 is true, it will try to
use system include file.

now in the same file in compile-file1 we have

        (compiler-pass2 c-pathname h-pathname system-p ))

and the beginning of compile-file1 is:

(defun compile-file1 (input-pathname
                      &key (output-file input-pathname)
                           (o-file t)
                           (c-file *default-c-file*)
                           (h-file *default-h-file*)
                           (data-file *default-data-file*)
                           (c-debug nil)
                           #+aosvs (ob-file nil)
                           (system-p *default-system-p*)

so during compile system-p is taken from *default-system-p*, unless
a specific values is given as a keyword argument.

Each version to wh-sandbox is typically a single changeset (some
large changes which are concepually a single unit are split into
multiple commits).  AFAIK you are receiveg the patches via axiom-commit
mailing list.  In my experience also web interface at:

http://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/axiom/

works reasonably.

Most patches to wh-sandbox are a very dull reading: they remove
hundreds of lines of machine generated files.  The following
patches to wh-sandbox fix user visible problems (many of them
were posted to the axiom-developr mailing list).  The number
allow to identify SVN version and get more details.

I've seen the changes on axiom-commit and some of them have been
merged with in the next release. For instance, I've removed all 
of the C prototype code. However, there are changes that are 
deeper (e.g. math) which do not have documentation or test cases,
such as changes to the series package. I'm not able to decide if
these changes are correct. I had a conversation with Clifton 
Williamson about it but so far the details are still unresolved. 
I'm still not clear if the original code, the previous patch, or
the current patch is correct. 

I'm also having difficulty deciding what changes should be added
and what changes are part of a larger change (e.g. the asq rewrite).
Is it possible to isolate a closed set of changes that are diff -Naur
changes from Gold? 

In general, publishing a changeset to a branch is not the same as
publishing a diff -Naur from Gold. I've been trying to sift thru
the changesets but it takes a great deal of time to decide what 
to do in the absence of documentation.

Working without published diff -Naur from Gold I expect that
people will complain that their favorite change will not be
included. I'd prefer to get it right the first time.

Tim

I'll try to document that patch today or tomorrow.  Did you already look at the
others?

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/IssueTracker?status:list=fix%20proposed

I also posted a documentation patch to ystream.spad.pamphlet some time ago.

Concerning "favorite fix":

* Waldek's patches to hyperdoc

* my patches to hyperdoc (i.e. spadedit.pamphlet) (#5, #144)

* the patch correcting the typo for multiset documentation (#319)

* the patch for the series package (#312)

* the patch to COMBF correcting the binomial inconsitency (a necessity for my
  guessingPackage, meanwhile) (#336)

* waldek's patch correcting the problem in normalize.

* #199, but is is hopeless to get documentation there, I think. Waldek is the
   only one we could ask...

Martin

Dear Ralf

(I'm the author of mantepse & co)

Ralf Stephan <ralf@ark.in-berlin.de> writes:

Hm, I don't see any %S strings in any of my source packages?

If you just want to use the package, I'd advise you to check out Waldek
Hebisch's branch, it contains my package and many other improvements.

Otherwise, here are some instructions:

you need to get *all* of

ssolve.spad.pamphlet
rec.spad.pamphlet
fffg.spad.pamphlet
mantepse.spad.pamphlet

Put them into a directory, say "guess" and cd to that directory:

cd guess

  you then have to issue

document ssolve.spad.pamphlet
document rec.spad.pamphlet
document fffg.spad.pamphlet
document mantepse.spad.pamphlet

  which should produce ssolve.spad, rec.spad, fffg.spad, mantepse.spad and also
  documentation in .dvi format.

  If any of these files contains "%S", something is wrong...

  Now you should start Axiom

axiom

  and start compiling *in this order*:

)co fffg.spad
)co ssolve.spad

  the following will most likely signal an error like "UFPS not found"...

)co mantepse.spad )co UFPS

  thus you have to do it once more:

)co mantepse.spad )co UFPS

)co rec.spad

  the following is the easiest way to work around a stupid bug...

)sys rm -rf UFPS.*

  this final compilation will take a *very* long time (half an hour or so)

)co mantepse.spad

  if any of the above compile commands (except the one indicated) fails, please
  send mail again.

  I'm very sorry that building is so complicated. I'd be very interested
  whether you succeed...



Good Luck, 

Martin

PS: this week there will be a yet improved version of my package available.

It is definitely a better implementation.

I'm working with 1.0.2 (in fact pre 1.0.3 since I use a file from CVS (be=
cause of some changes
in the FOP compiler in 1.0.2, in some circumstances, undeclared variables=
 are not "accepted",
the "real" compiler treats them as specials)).
I'll keep my implementation since the unix feature and the function unix-=
mkdir is available on
Windows, though I'm hesitant.

Thanks,

Greg

Yes, I understood that part.

The link I'm missing is why Axiom's misbehaviour (reported by both
Gregory and Martin) is traced back to that.  Or am I lured by the
title of the thread? (I have been travelling the whole week, so I have
no access to all the discussion, only this one and some other bits).

First, this fixes _part_ of the problem that Martin reported (problem
reported by Gregory are fixed by another patch).

allows Axiom to work when build tree is not present.  In other words,
when you make a tarball of installed Axiom and put it on another
machine it will work, unless there is unreadable directory on path
leading to original build tree.

That is, one still gets the error when build tree is unreadable.  It is
hard to say who is a guilty party.  At least part of blame goes to the
following:

- gcc: it skips nonexistent directories, but raises errors for unreadable
  ones
- gcl: it unconditionally adds include directive of form
    -I/gcl/system/directory/../h
  (where /gcl/system/directory/ is stored in si::*system-directory*
  variable)
- Axiom, because it lets si::*system-directory* stay at its default
  setting.

One possibility to solve this problem is to point si::*system-directory*
(more precisely the pathname with "../h" appended) to known empty (or non
existent) directory (for example somwhere inside Axiom tree).  If we
decide to do that we may even create real h directory and put
cmpinclude.h there.  I initially rejected such idea (changing 
si::*system-directory*) because I prefer limit our intervention into
gcl internals (note that compiler::*default-system-p* is nil by
default, so my patch merely restored default setting).  I was
also not aware that evan after applying the patch the permission
problem is still present:  my assumption was that gcl should be
capable of generating working standalone executables which can
compile code on the fly.  It is obvious that such executable
needs C compiler in the system, but I consider it a bug that
mere presence of unreadable directory with a magic name can
break such a program.

On my machine wh-sandbox does not istall "document".  Do you want to
have "document" installed?

I belive that following patch (applied to wh-sandbox) fixes this problem.
The patch may be somewhat controversial -- I removed code for ancient
systems (because this code is clearly broken by later changes) and
decided to consistently apply convention that directory names have
no extra directory separator at the end.  The changes may works or
not on Windows depending how Windows Lisps handle namestrings,
since I can not test what happens on Windows I did not try to add
special code.  AFAIK Windows kernel happily works with pathnames
containing slashes and many portable programs internally exclusively
use slashes in pathnames (converting from backslashes on input),
so the code _may_ work.  

Anyway, patch follows (note that this patch will probably do
no good without other pathname changes from wh-sandbox):

I'm not sure if Camm reads axiom-devel, so, did you consider asking him?

Actually, in other lisps that hosted Axiom, such as VMLisp, it was
perfectly possible for the so-called function position of an
expression to contain virtually any expression. VMLisp will do a
complete recursive evaluation of the car of an expression.  Common
lisp introduced restrictions on what could appear in the function
position. Since common lisp is our new, favorite lisp we can remove
the test. Portions of the code still contain these historical lisp-isms.

Aha, this is what I missed -- I thought the other parts were also solved.

> Anyway, patch follows (note that this patch will probably do
> no good without other pathname changes from wh-sandbox

Here is where my problem arises. When trying to build a system that
many people will use, such as Gold, it is important that I don't
introduce more, or more subtle, errors than I fix. I'm very reluctant
to change what I don't understand since, in the long run I and others
may need to maintain it.

In order to apply your changes I will need to evaluate every other
change you've made to decide if it is related or a prerequisite change.
It can take a day or more to difference your source tree from Gold and
do this evaluation since there is no documentation in the source files
explaining why the change was made. And it is not clear if these changes
depend on other parts of your sandbox, such as Gaby's build system.

This change is a worthwhile idea and should be brought forward to Gold.
It would be most helpful, and Gold would happen a lot faster, if you 
could take the time to make a diff-Naur Gold patch containing the
complete changeset.

My understanding is that Camm is subscribed to the list.  However,
from time to time -- for our own protection against spams -- bona fide
subscribers may be unsubscribed.  I believe Camm had suggested to be
explicitly CC:'d in case his input is needed.  Furthermore, I think he
also explained that he will not be back before March or something like
that.

Hello,

  Axiom's implementation of Boot's and Spad source includer
(src/boot/btincl2.boot, src/interp/cstream.boot) uses lazyness (faked
through function "Delay").  This is also variously known as zipper.
My quesion is how much of the complexity introduced by faking
lazyness actually outweight the benefits?  Is the lazyness actually
beneficial?

My point is that GCC is inconsistent here: both non-existent and unreadable
directory raise the some alternative: either directory is not needed
(and may be safely skipped) or is needed.  I can guess that GCC made
a pragmatic decision here: non existent directories are probably very
frequent and GCC does not dare to signal error.

Try the following (or belive me that you get indicated result). Create
a simple Spad file.  Take Axiom from build-improvements (or wh-sandbox),
with gcl intalation visible.  By default you should see 
compiler::*default-system-p* set to t.

1) Try just compiling your file.  It should compile fine.
2) Change access right on gcl instaltion so that it is unreadable by
you.  Again try compiling: you should see error about lack of
access to gcl directory
3) rename gcl directory. Again try compiling: you should see a
cascade of errors from gcc (due to missing declarations from
include file).
4) do
)lisp (setf compiler::*default-system-p* nil)
compile again: Your file should compile fine.
5) Move back gcl instalation into is original place (still
ureadable by you).  Compile again: you should see the same
error as in 2.

Point 4 shows that executable created by gcl _can_ compile Lisp
files if compiler::*default-system-p*  is set to nil and
include directory is either absent or readible.  With include
directory present, but unreadable (point 5 above) you get errors.

As I wrote, when compiler::*default-system-p* is nil C files generated
by gcl do not need the gcl include file.  But gcl still add corresponding
-I option to gcc comand line, and you get spurious errors.

AFAICS the main potential of benefit of lazyness is that it allows
writing algorithm as if it operated on the whole file, but still
have "interactive" parser -- that is parser which stops reading
its input when it sees end of a syntactic construct.

This potential benefit is completly lost in Axiom: the command
line parser requires that the whole construct is on single logical
line (that is single line after joining all continuated lines).
I can guess that command line parser is non-interactive due to
backtracking and also because whitespace syntax lacks explicit
end-of-construct markes (for example parser sees that a procedure
ended only when seeing next procedure or end of file).

I must say that this whole pipeline:

scan.boot.pamphlet pile.boot.pamphlet pf2sex.boot.pamphlet
pf2atree.boot.pamphlet parini.boot.pamphlet packtran.boot.pamphlet
macex.boot.pamphlet intfile.boot.pamphlet incl.boot.pamphlet
dq.boot.pamphlet cstream.boot.pamphlet cparse.boot.pamphlet
astr.boot.pamphlet

is on my list of candidates for removal.  I would like to reuse
parts of this code, but I belive that what we need can be done
simpler.  However, rewriting this part for me is of low priority,
and I probably will not get to this before summer.

My vision of future compiler is:  
- classical lexer which generates basic syntax tree nodes (including
  line number info)
- first stage parser (build surface syntax tree) accepting very
  loose grammar
- macroexpander
- second stage parser (flattening trees and checking syntactic
  constraints which cna be checked only after macro expansion)
- typechecker, probably multipass.  In first few passes I would only
  consider interface parts, the final pass would also check bodys
  (and resolve overloading)
- final code generation

Some remarks why such structure:  I want macro expansion rather
early, because before macro expansion is it impossible to check
for syntax correctness.  Also, full syntactic information helps
with typechecking (current parser has it backwards, it uses
type information for parsing, leading sometimes to weird errors).

Also, current compiler couples code generation with type checking,
which is potentialy wastefull.  Namely, in some cases the compiler
has to do backtracking search on possible type assignments, so
it generates code and then discard it during backtracking (I am
not sure how serious this problem is -- most of the time backtracking
is very limited).  

During compilation in some cases (IIRC in chaseInferences) the compiler
uses recursive traversal on a dag (ignoring identity of nodes)
which leads to about 3m spent on a single file (samewhat surprisingly
the particular procedure I found shows pathological behaviour only one
file, on other taking only little time).

I belive that having typechecking as a separate phase operationg
essentially on the whole program would allow beter search technique
and would avoid many time sinks (currently many global data structure
are invalidated after compilation of any constructors, which is
probably responsible for nonlinear compile times for multifile
compilations).

I'm familiar with Haskell -- and have written slightly more than "toy"
programs in Haskell, so I appreciate the benefits of lazyness in
general.  I apologize I did not make make it clearer that I'm talking
of the specific case of Axiom's way of consuming the token stream.

I posit that if we had strictness analysis in Axiom, then the analysis
would find out that actually the parts that effectively consumes the
token stream are strict in the token stream argument.  So, lazyness
buys nothing.  I base that conjecture over "debugging" under GCL.
That is why I raised the question of the lazyness benefits in the
specific case of Axiom's current infrastructure.

Yes.  Which a strictness analysis will find out.

Yes.  But, I don't think that makes a huge difference.

| dq.boot.pamphlet cstream.boot.pamphlet cparse.boot.pamphlet
| astr.boot.pamphlet
| 
| is on my list of candidates for removal.

There are many files on that list that I would disagree on removing.
This statement is based on spending a non-negligible part of the last
10 months studying from different angles.  No doubt they need
improvement.  But, I'm deeply skeptical about their removal.

I've done some work on it in several local tress, but their
combination is not a coherent structure at this time I'm afraid.

While working on those parts of the compiler (and interpreter), I've
considered a suggestion made by Bill Page some time ago: maybe rewrite
Axiom in Haskell?  On several occasions, I've resisted that idea.
But, if we get the improvements in both Boot and the compiler
structures, it will look a lot like something written in "simple
Haskell".  Funny.

I'm unclear about your issue with macro expansion.  From my
understanding, they happen very early in the compilation process --
albeit not like C macro expansion (a horror I would like to see
disappear the surface of the planet).

   --% WHERE
   compWhere([.,form,:exprList],m,eInit) ==
     $insideExpressionIfTrue: local:= false
     $insideWhereIfTrue: local:= true
     e:= eInit
     u:=
       for item in exprList repeat
         [.,.,e]:= comp(item,$EmptyMode,e) or return "failed"
     u="failed" => return nil
     $insideWhereIfTrue:= false
     [x,m,eAfter]:= comp(macroExpand(form,eBefore:= e),m,e) or return nil
     eFinal:=
       del:= deltaContour(eAfter,eBefore) => addContour(del,eInit)
       eInit
     [x,m,eFinal]


I would like Axiom to have the ability to store the following:
  (1) the "parse form"
  (2) the "fully typed ast" before code generation

I have an intermediate representation of Spad in Spad.  It lacks
a couple of feature, but I can handle almost all algebra files.

That idea is already present in some form:

intloopSpadProcess(stepNo,lines,ptree,interactive?)==
    $stepNo:local := stepNo
    $currentCarrier := cc := ['carrier]
    ncPutQ(cc, 'stepNumber, stepNo)
    ncPutQ(cc, 'messages, $ncMsgList)
    ncPutQ(cc, 'lines, lines)
    $ncMsgList := nil
    result := CatchAsCan(flung, Catch("SpadCompileItem",
     CATCH($intCoerceFailure, CATCH($intSpadReader,
       interp(cc, ptree, interactive?))))) where
 
        interp(cc, ptree, interactive?) ==
            ncConversationPhase(function phParse,            [cc, ptree])
            ncConversationPhase(function phMacro,            [cc])
            ncConversationPhase(function phIntReportMsgs,[cc, interactive?])
            ncConversationPhase(function phInterpret,        [cc])
 
            #ncEltQ(cc, 'messages) ^= 0 => ncError()
 
    intSetNeedToSignalSessionManager()
    $prevCarrier := $currentCarrier
    result = 'ncEnd     => stepNo
    result = 'ncError   => stepNo
    result = 'ncEndItem => stepNo
    stepNo+1

Martin,
it all works now thanks to your detailed help. I compiled
the latest axiom-silver, that's why the reply took so long.

The problem was, on the web page I saw the button named 'src'
and I thought hey just )read that into axiom ...

Axiom Silver has a bug BTW which prevents it from building
from svn. svn creates subdirectories named .svn/ with some read-only
files, and at two places in the make process there are commands
'cp -r' (recursive) that will try to copy these directories, too.
Maybe they should be changed to 'cp -r [a-zA-Z]* ...'?

If SPAD provides "Generator" that would be sufficient. In Aldor-Combinat 
I have implemented streams and formal power series building on that concept.

I have not checked Axiom, but I guess defining a series like

s: FormalPowerSeries(Integer) := new();
set!(s, 1 + monom * s * s);

is not possible. Am I wrong? Maybe the delay keyword allows it??? (Could 
someone show me?)

Of course, I would rather like to write

s := 1 + monom * s * s;

or perhaps with == instead of :=, but that would really require lazyness.

The lazyness I was talking about in my message is at the Boot source
code level.

Lazyness at Spad level is a different issue.  The computational rules
used by Spad does not seem to be documented anywhere. Experimental
evidence suggests "call by value" but that does not seem to be
sancitoned by an official documentation.

> Is the lazyness actually beneficial?

I do not have knowledge of the internals of boot, which was
designed and written entirely by Dick Jenks and Bill Burge.
There were many parsers for Axiom and this was a research
area for Bill. I suspect that the DELAY you see in the zipper
parser was just another research experiment, not related to
the delay in recent languages in any way.

Frankly I believe the whole thing should be rewritten using the
syntax and semantics of Aldor but implemented in lisp, following 
the original scratchpad project plan.

The C based version can never reach into the axiom algebra tree
where the real value of axiom lies. Most of the functionality of
Aldor already exists. A cleanly designed and implemented parser
would go a long way toward making the project a stronger research
platform, both for language and for algebra. We could remove all
of boot and its complications and have a clearly specified AST
layer that users could access. Indeed, done properly and carefully
documented a new parser would allow an algebra file to define its
own input syntax, similar to it's ability to define its own output
syntax. Thus a quantum physics user could implement the "bra" and
"ket" operators, handle greek letters, etc.

But I think a parser rewrite waits on the language definition.
I don't think it would benefit us to be overly religious about
the language points at this time. It would be more important to
be able to parse what exists cleanly and make the parser extensible
from algebra. Lisp gives us the unique ability to manipulate the
intermediate language forms in the same implementation language.
Thus the "overhead" of letting algebra introduce new syntax is
minimal since even the console readtables can be changed on the fly.

I agree with the goal, except on the mean: src/boot/ should be
improved instead of being replaced by a system directly written in
Lisp.  I've spent a fair amount trying to understand that part of the
system.  I conjecture that anything that would be reinvented in Lisp
would be inferior and the resource is best spent documenting and
improving it.  For example, pattern matching let us directly express
algorithms and ideas, instead of the current circumvolutions of
predicate testing and wild casting.  src/boot/ already has pattern
matching, along with algebraic data type definition.  Initial testing
shows that the translator translates just fine.  It is regretful that
it has not been used in the rest of src/interp.

yes, and many aspect of the current implementation reminds me of use
Template Haskell

in domain specific languages.

Well, clearly "personal" experimentation is a non-issue.

I'm not claiming that anyone has an obligation to share their
local changes. Indeed, the license does not require this either.
However, working together on a common project tends to imply sharing.
But real sharing involves work to "get it off your desk" and into
the common distribution.

The published mechanism for making changes to Gold is to post
  diff -Naur goldcode yourcode >patch
files to the mailing list




I see changes in various files that can be picked up at this time and
would benefit everyone. However, there are several, shall we say,
"challenges":



Challenge 1: SIMPLE CHANGES, such as removing the C prototype
  code is clear, tedious, harmless, and requires no explanation.
  I've already picked up these changes and made sure they happen
  in every file.




Challenge 2: LESS OBVIOUS CHANGES, such as eliding "member" from
  the boot code. This change was made with no documentation added
  to the source code making it impossible to (a) guess why and
  (b) test. Furthermore, there are no test cases so even if I
  understood it I'd have to develop the test cases again (assuming
  you had them in the first place) from scratch.




Challenge 3: ALGEBRA CHANGES. these are clearly beneficial as
  they address known bugs. Unfortunately I'm not an expert in ALL
  of the algebra and I'm adverse to changing what I don't understand.
  (Consider me the first in a long line of people maintaining this 
   code over the next 30 years. If I can't understand it how will they?)
  There was a change to the series code which went into Gold. Now we
  find out that the "fix" was wrong and a new "fix" is proposed. 
  I spoke with Clifton Williamson, the original author of the code, to
  try to validate the original code vs the new fix, so far with no
  decision. Do we want algebra bug fixes to lay around unmerged?
  Do we want to change algebra we don't understand? If we understand
  it do we want to share that information with future maintainers?

  If algebra bug fixes are to be merged we'd need to have some
  explanation of the algorithm so the code could be understood by
  people other than the person who proposed the fix. You need to
  understand the algorithm to fix it anyway so write down what you
  understand so others can understand.

  If algebra bug fixes are to be merged we'd need to have some
  test cases of the algorithm so the code can be checked, especially
  for boundary cases. If you've understood the algorithm and can fix
  it I'd suppose that you had test cases. Publish these as part of
  the fix.




Challenge 4: DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGES. these are harder to merge as
  they will completely restructure axiom. this will have an impact
  not only on the main line of code but also on every other "private"
  branch of axiom, so it is vital that they are complete, consistent,
  and correct. 

  In order to merge this code it would need a cleanly documented
  pile of code. One of the main project goals is to make sure that
  the system can be maintained. That implies that other people can
  gain an understanding of the code without having to reverse
  engineer it. We're stuck with the reverse engineering task because
  Daly, et.al. didn't document anything. Lets learn from history.

  It would also have to be a diff of Gold since it would be impossible
  to know all of the little dependent pieces that are tucked away
  (e.g. the new axiom-c-macro.h file) or the new handling of
  gcl-cmpinclude.h, etc. You've spent months making GNU configure
  work. Wouldn't it be frustrating to find it badly broken because
  of merging problems?

  Other deep changes, such as a new parser, are also likely to be a
  "challenge 4" task.





> The axiom-commit mailing list has the history of all commits
> to SVN -- when they are not truncated due to SF policy

The axiom-commit mailing list posts are essentially worthless as a
Gold-merge resource. I can reclaim the same information in more detail
by doing 
   diff -r --brief build-improvements gold

What's missing is the (a) changesets (b) documentation (c) tests

The "changeset" mentality is that all of the changes necessary to
produce a final single effect are packaged in a single set of patches.

Changesets are essential to contain all of a change and only a change.
In the current bi/wh branches even simple changes, such as eliding
the C protoype code are spread over multiple commits and not fully
implemented everywhere. The new asq requires new database formats
and changes to the database generation code, all of which have to
happen at the same time.

Documentation is essential because while the axiom-commit says something
cryptic like "fixed bug #NNN", that message is hardly considered a high
quality, "production" piece of code. If we're going to make progress
against the winds of time we've got to consider the future maintainers.

Tests are necessary so that (a) other people can see what the impact
of a change is, (b) we can see what breaks in other peoples' branches
or the gold branch, (c) we can (eventually) regression test and (d) we
can eventually build up a more organized, comprehensive test suite 
like CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite) that other people can build upon.




Since I'm in the midst of reverse-engineering the build-improvements
and wh-sandbox branches it would be a good time to consider packaging
up changesets for functionality you consider complete and ready. I know
it takes you away from "interesting" axiom tasks. The whole build process
has already cost me several weeks so I understand.

I am trying to help, but sorry ATM I am very busy.  The list I posted
contains all changes that I consider to be user visible changes.  I belive
they are mostly independent of other patches.  Patches to .spad files
should apply to Gold with no (or little) changes.  Most algebra patches
reference bug numbers in Issue tracker.  Having Issue tracker number
you can find a testcase and frequently disscusion. Some fixes are
taken from Issue tracker.  Many algebra fixes show in test result
(the script I posted helps to automate comparison).  In particular
bug 312 is prominently visible (IIRC in series2.output) -- just
compare test results.

IIRC one fix to .spad files depends on changes to file handling
in interpreter (this should be obvious since those changes form
a single changeset == form single patch).  I think that changes
to interpreter files are independent of build system. One change
affecting Hyperdoc, that is installation on libdb etc, changes
Makefiles -- IIRC I have posted a version of this patch which
applies to Gold.  One change to Hyperdoc (extra change in protocol)
must be done both to Hyperdoc and to interpreter (otherwise
things will break), I belive that other Hyperdoc changes can be
applied independently (but some fixes concern Hyperdoc crashes,
so if you take incomplete set of fixes crash may eliminate 
possibility to see improvement due to other fixes).

I do not have time to make (and test) diffs to Gold.  But even
if I had time I do not know if making such diffs would be a
good idea: IIUC your devlopement version is different from
published one and you apply diffs manually.  Most of the time
different between Gold and wh-sandbox is trivial and will
cause no trouble.  The only trouble points are likely to
be due to removal of duplicate code in wh-sandbox and improvements
to build machinery.  But those to changes are made precisely
to avoid doing extra work.  Gaby spent time cleaning build
system, I spent time identifying duplicate/unused code (I do
_not_ remove code lightly).  Now you want us to spent time
working with issues that our work eliminated?

Note, if you want changes to wh-sandbox as separate patches
I can provide this (but I think you already have them from
the commit mailing list).  Also, if you have specific questions
concering patches I will try to answer.

That issue has been discussed on the mailing list: 

Shoe tranlates member to MEMBER and passes MEMBER unchanged
Boot tranlates MEMBER to |member| and passes member as |member|

(to check just look at generated Lisp).  MEMBER and |member| have
different semantics.  If you look at generated spad files you
may easily see that compiler which uses MEMBER (insted of |member|)
mistranslate many files.

I wrote an explanation.  And my conclusion is simple: original code
was correct, but did not handle some cases with negative powers.
After change those cases were handled correctly, but fix missed
the last line from original code.  I restored the this missing
line (which is needed _only_ when constant term is 0).

Tim, at least in wh-sandbox I tried to have changeset == commit.  There
are some exceptions (merge from build improvements was split into
few commits, once or twice I made a mistake and next commit fixed this),
but essentially having commits you have changesets.

If you want to make changes completly indepenent then I must say sorry.
I try to avoid unneded dependencies, but changes I do are all part
of larger effort to make Axiom better.  Each is self contained but
may depend on previous changes.  Note that identifying independent
sets is a nonlinear and essentially useless task -- we want _one_
good version, not a myriad of combiantions of various patches.

No.  New asq should work fine with old databases.  Old asq can not
work with compressed or pretty printed databases (note that 
database documentation claims that compression is optional and
says that hunks are just Lisp forms -- nothing forbiding
pretty printing).  So new asq just implements what is documented
(removes undocumented restrictions from old asq).  The new
asq is _required_ if you want to use asq with uncompressed
databases (or prett print them).

This is true in general, including your changes to Gold we don't see
until the Big Day.  I'm trying to single you out.  We all have local
experimental trees that would do more harms if published than kept local.

[...]

Those changes are clearly beneficial in isolation.  Please note also
that because Gold and Silver have gone, until very recently, into very
uncertain status, it was hard to do anything useful.  Changes should
first go into Silver before being picked up and lifted to Gold.  We,
at least me, don't know which branch is Silver and what is its
status.  I don't know which is going to be Gold and its day-to-day
status, i.e. preview of what is to be Gold.  Under those
circumstances, it is hard to do anything useful to Silver and Gold.

I don't remember any patch eliding "member" from the Boot code.

Those changes that would go into Gold, are ideally, diffs between
Silver and Gold.  However, I no longer know what is Silver and what is
Gold. 

| What's missing is the (a) changesets (b) documentation (c) tests

| The "changeset" mentality is that all of the changes necessary to

The "changeset" mentality must make room for incremental improvements;
that is a necessity when you don't have the power (e.g. resources) to
make change in one shot in a timely manner and remain useful.  Users
are more tolerant of incremental improvements than may be assumed.

It is not a matter of taking me away from "interesting" axiom tasks than
asking me to allocate time today or this week when I have none to
solve the fuzzily defined problem.  I was travelling last week
attending (important) ISO C++ meetings, which made me fall behind
class schedules which I need to catch on this week, plus the usual
deadlines that come hard when time is short.


I need the following:
  (a) a clear mark of what is Silver, what is Gold
  (b) I would like to be able to propose diff between Silver and Gold
      for inclusion in Gold
  (c) I would like to have patches applied directly to Silver,
      assumming the general community is interested.  I.e. I would like
      to see more testing of "gold preview".

Can we work that out?

I published my whole research tree (in git, since svn was broken)
in November when we had this same discussion but got no response.
All of my axiom-related work is now kept in that tree.

The plan was to publish a new Gold at the end of November.  But in the
beginning of November we had the big discussion about me being "a
single point of failure" so I stepped out of the way and told everyone
that any changes they wanted in Gold they would have to do
themselves. Everyone had permission to do that. Since that time no-one
has changed anything. It became clear that nobody was going to make
the effort to create a new release.  I've decided to step back into
the role of releasing systems and am trying to catch up to the
outstanding changes.

I tried maintaining silver but I was the only one making changes.
Plus the additional copies of Axiom were causing rising server costs.
If it depends on my effort silver is dead. I only have enough time
available to do Gold and do my own axiom-related work. I certainly
don't have time to maintain silver. Since advocacy is volunteering
you're welcome to create and maintain a silver version that is a
test version for gold changes. 

Gold will again be released on a 2-month, best-effort schedule.

Tim

My understanding was that decision was the outcome of
miscommunication, therefore I was not going to do any release or do any
commit to Silver or Gold (I don't know exactly which trees are those)
_until that was resolved_.  Clearly, I'm not going to take anybody's
place if that someone thinks he is being "kicked out".  Sorry to put
it that way, but that is how your message sounded.


[ For example, I needed an "official" version for my last semester
  class project, but in the end I distributed an official version
  of build-improvements so that students can work.  I would have
  preferred it was official. ]

I very much welcome your stepping back into the role of releasing the
system.

| I tried maintaining silver but I was the only one making changes.

Going back to last semester discussion, you're the only one doing the
commit to Silver, because it appeared to me that:
  (1) the system was set up in a way that you're the only one to
      effectively commit to silver, e.g. any commit to SF SVN
      reposiotyr is effectively "lost" from your perspective.

  (2) you wanted to take over silver, which I was originally maintaining.

| test version for gold changes.

So, we are again back to what things were in April-September 2006?
This is an important question I need a clear answer for.

As I already pointed out, we should encourage people to commit
themselves their patches to Silver.  That reduces the load on the
maintainer.

Here are results of my analysis of several integrals from mapleok
before and after applying arc tangent patch.  

I had examined a few other integral, but did not record my conclusion.
In general for integrals missing from (rather short) list below I 
make no statement.  To conclude that we get an integral wrong I
was typically satisfied with results of numerical integration. To
conclude that we got integral OK I looked if jump discontinuities are
present (absence of jump discontinuities means we got the integral
correct).  I did some sanity checking for other problems, but
besically I trusted that up to jump discontinuities we get them
correct.

integrate(z/(2-cos(z^2))^2, z=0..2, "noPole")
was wrong
is wrong

in1012a:=integrate(log(abs(z^3-1))/(1+z)^2, z= 0..%plusInfinity,"noPole")
wrong

in1084a:=integrate(atan(sin(z))+atan(1/sin(z)), z= 0..1,"noPole")
wrong

in1118:=integrate(acot(z), z= 0..1/2*I)
was wrong
is OK

in1149:=integrate(imag(z)*z^(1/6), z= -%i..%i)
wrong

in1167a:=integrate((z^2)^(1/6), z= -3..-1,"noPole")
wrong

in1183a:=integrate(csc(z), z= 1-I..1+I,"noPole")
too complicated

in1186a:=integrate((z^2+z)^(1/2)/(1+z^2)^2, z= 0..1,"noPole")
was OK
is wrong

in1190a:=integrate(sin(z)^2*tan(z)^(1/2), z=0..1, "noPole")
was wrong
is wrong
too complicated answer

in1191a:=integrate(sin(z)^2/tan(z)^(1/2), z= 0..1,"noPole")

Dear Waldek,

It seems I've got a problem compiling version 441 of wh-sandbox.

* gcl is not insatlled on my machine

* configure doesn't seem to do anything unusual

* make seems to get into an infinite loop starting with

if test "." != "."; then \
   cp -r ./gcl .; \
fi; cd gcl; \
./configure --prefix=/local/scratch/wh-sandbox/build/i686-pc-linux --enable-statsysbfd --disable-dynsysbfd --enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-maxpage=256*1024 --disable-tkconfig --disable-x --disable-xgcl && \
        make && make install
/bin/sh: line 0: cd: gcl: No such file or directory


Martin

As far as I know wh-sandbox requires that both gcl and noweb be
pre-installed *before* building Axiom.

As far as I am concerned, that is a good thing. gcl and noweb
should not be part of the Axiom distribution.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Martin,

I hit the same thing and worked around it by copying the gcl tree over 
from build-improvements.

Cheers,

I believe Waldek said you must have GCL installed if you want to use
wh-sandbox.  If that recollection is accurate, then I think he might
want to enforce that at configuration time,

It may not be obvious but you do not need to checkout the complete
build-improvements branch in order to get gcl and noweb. The following
svn commands are sufficient:

   svn co
https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements/gcl

   svn co
https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements/noweb

To build gcl just the default build would be sufficient:

   $ cd ~/gcl
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make install

( by default installs in /usr/local )

But if you want optimize GCL just for building Axiom you can use:

   $ ./configure --prefix=... --disable-tkconfig --disable-x --disable-xgcl

where ... is where you want to install gcl and '.../bin' must in the PATH

   $ export PATH=.../bin:$PATH

To install noweb you must edit the Makefile by hand:

   $ cd ~/noweb/src

or apply the following patch to install noweb in /usr/local:

-------- noweb.patch ----------

   $ patch < noweb.patch
   $ make

Note:

This patch uses the 'icon' option instead of 'awk'. Using icon results in
a significantly faster version of noweb. You can download icon from

   http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon

In general to compile wh-sandbox you need to do one of the following:

-- have gcl pre-installed on your machine (note that if you have gcl in
   a private directory you can tell configure where to find it)
-- copy gcl tree from build-improvements.

I will put this information into README.wh.  Also, for out of source
build the build just stopped -- I will investigate how to detect missing
gcl tree and give sensible error message (intead of the loop you were
seeing).
