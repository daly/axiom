For example, I was looking for research papers related to Axiom.  I
knew they were buried deeply somewhere in the hierarchical pages.

see the message I sent to axiom-mail.

| 
| My first reaction is: Hmmm, that doesn't look so different than the
| Axiom Wiki FrontPage... The time to display seems quite similar over
| a high speed connection and a reasonably fast system (AMD 3500+).
| 
| Differences I noticed:
| 
| 1) Maxima uses just a left side-bar but Axiom Wiki currently uses
|    both left and right side-bars, but just a left side-bar
|    navigation bar on all other pages.
| 
| 2) The Axiom Wiki FrontPage has more graphics including an example
|    Axiom output graphic.

That, from my perspective, contributes to the "visual load".

| 3) The Maxima web site is not a wiki.

I understand that.  I'm not sure I see the benefits of having the
frontpage being a wiki -- but that is a minor point I guess.

| 4) The Maxima web site has no search function.

that is a minus for them, and a plus for us :-)

| I don't find anything that makes the Maxima page seem simpler or
| that gives me the impression that information is more readily
| accessible. What am I missing?
| 
| When I looked at:
| 
| http://yacas.sourceforge.net
| 
| I thought:
| 
| 1) Yacas FrontPage doesn't say much and has only a minimal set
|    of links (no side-bars).

minimal is beautiful :-)

As I said, my preference goes to maxima's style.  Yacas' is at one end
of the spectrum.  I find that Axiom's holds the other end. 


| 2) Yacas uses a fixed left side-bar on other pages.
| 
| 3) Not a wiki.
| 
| 4) No search.
| 
| When I look at:
| 
| http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/
| 
| my reaction is:
| 
| 1) Looks a lot like Axiom Wiki.

but much simpler; visually.  It has direct links to what I would call
the essential stuff.

| 2) Has search.
| 
| 3) Has both left and right side-bars.
| 
| 4) Not a wiki.

Why is having the front-page as wiki a plus?
For all I know, only a handful of people can actually modify that page.
For other pages, due to irritating spams, the system has made it
complicated for good citizens to contribute changes.  I don't see a
difference between that and maintaining the website files as part of
the SVN or CVS repository.  The latter seems simpler to me -- but I'm
not proposing it.  Just observing.

|

| 
| http://portal.axiom-developer.org/refs

Yes, I do.

| Maybe this deserves a link on the Axiom Wiki FrontPage?

This is precisely what I suggested in the message I sent (yesterday I
believe) to axiom-mail.

I don't think we have too many lists;  we're just misusing axiom-devel

yes, layout.  I think the color is OK.

| 
| Can you give an example of something that is exciting and/or
| appealing about Axiom that is not found on the FrontPage?
| 
| What constituents "dig through" to you?

For example, I know that if I log into the portal I can find the links
to the articles; but I don't know how many clicks it takes to find it
from the frontpage.

Yesterday, I was looking for something in the documentation of the
silver branch and realized there was a page for "development" (or
something like that) that is a hierarchical parent of the silver
stuff.

I don't propose to put all links ono the frontpage though :-)

| Do you mean just

at most two.

I saw it somewhere (that is from yesterday memory)... It turns out
that I read it from Axiom's SF page.  Sorry for that.

Actually, I'm interested in a publically accessible list of
applications of computer algebra in fields other than maths.   Do you
happen to know one?

we should be explicit about it -- it is part of "they should not dig
through." :-)

Hello Gaby,

[Wiki-Frontpage]
> For example, I was looking for research papers related to Axiom.  I
> knew they were buried deeply somewhere in the hierarchical pages.

I agree with Gaby, the FrontPage is missing some information that I 
would like to find there. So I added some questions to the FAQ section.
If everyone would enter questions there (yes just questions other people 
might answer), then that would be a way to know what people are looking 
for and modify the FrontPage accordingly.Unfortunately, I could not come 
up with a better suggestion. I think Bill did a great job. Thank you, 
Bill. But Gaby, imagine you have to design the FrontPage yourself. Maybe 
that seems simple, but the links you put there should lead to some 
reasonable content.

> | http://portal.axiom-developer.org/refs
> 
> Yes, I do.
> 
> | Maybe this deserves a link on the Axiom Wiki FrontPage?

I agree. Maybe it should be called "related literature" in the 
documentation section.

> yes, layout.  I think the color is OK.

I think, layout and color is OK. I am more concerned with the contents 
of the left and right columns.

For example, I quite dislike the Download section. Newcomers don't have 
any idea what we mean by Gold and Silver branch. Although personally, I 
find gold and silver quite nice, but in general it is more clear if we 
call this "stable" and "unstable" for the general public.

Think about what you would like.

(1) Precompiled binaries
(2) Sources (as .tgz and tar.bz2 and .zip)
(3) CVS/SVN/Arch access
(4) Browse sources online

All of that would refer to the stable (gold) release of the sources.

(1) Precompiled binaries
The corresponding page would just list the binaries and some note of how 
to install them.

(2) Sources (as .tgz and tar.bz2 and .zip)
(3) CVS/SVN/Arch access
Maybe these two points could be just one and be called "Sources".
The corresponding page would first tell people about stable=gold, 
unstable=silver then have a section "Gold" and "Silver".
The Gold section comes with subsections
"Tarball" where the links to tgz and tar.bz2 and .zip are given 
directly, and
"Repository access" where it is described that we have CVS and TLA 
archives of GOLD and an algorithm (shell commands) of how to access the 
sources. Additionally, it should be stated that for contributing to 
Axiom one should use the Silver branch. (I know that could be argued.)

See
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandboxAxiomSources
and tell me what you think.
(Could one have a table of contents at the top of that page?)

(4) Browse sources online
That should be something like the "Online Source" that currently exists.
But if you press "Online sources" currently it leads to
	
/mathaction/axiom--test--1/

I know it is irrelevant, but the "test" in the name is misleading. The 
page http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/FrontPage
(and archive) should rather be called "Axiom-Stable". Yes, not the same 
naming conventions as the tla archive. Bill, if you could write on top 
of that page that people are browsing the latest stable release, that 
would be wonderful.

I think the "Build Axiom" entry under download is unnecessary. There 
should be just a link from the "AxiomSources" page to the BuildAxiom 
page. And the BuildAxiom page should be cleaned up a bit.

Ralf

Dear Gaby,

last night, I've managed to compile silver/trunk. I've made a few 
changes to makefiles and some pamphlets in order to get rid of the problems.

Now the "re-copying of the .svn directory"-problem is no problem anymore.

There were some problems with pamphlet files, in particular bookvol1 and 
some others.

I really wonder what silver/trunk actually is. It is not Gold, since 
that "just works" and would not have latex problems.

Tim, could you put your "gold-to-be" branch to the public. I strongly 
believe that it should be *identical* with silver/trunk. You need not 
care about the SVN archive, but it would be necessery to **see** your 
latest development even if it does not *just work*. It is totally clear 
for all developers that Silver does not 100% have the "just works" 
predicate.

Gaby, I have now seen that there is a branch build-improvements. 
Currently, I worked on the trunk, but perhaps you tell me it is better 
if I commit my modifications to 'build-improvements'.

Gaby, Antoine, Tim, could you also add a few lines to the bottom of
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandboxAxiomSources
Thank you.

Ralf

Hi Bill,

Is the FAQ page special?

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/FAQ/editform

Even if I give a reason it doesn't let me save it.

Could someone explain the target

${SRC}/scripts/Makefile:

in chunk <<scriptsdir>> in src/Makefile.pamphlet?

${SRC}/scripts/Makefile: ${SRC}/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet
	@echo 2 making ${SRC}/scripts/Makefile from \
            ${SRC}/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet
	@( cd scripts ; \
            ${DOCUMENT} ${NOISE} Makefile ; \
            cp Makefile.dvi ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/scripts.Makefile.dvi )

I don't see that this chunk creates src/scripts/Makefile. It's a bit weird.

Ralf,

You should be able to edit it now. I had to get rid of the
HTML href links. These are not allowed on Axiom Wiki right now
in order to prevent link spam. You must use the format

  "link text":http://....

instead.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Me too, actually, I hope I did not make a mistake somewhere.
But before other people could check out and test build-improvements, you 
should merge with trunk. I have deliberately not put the unescaped "&" 
problem that appears in src/input/zimmer.input.pamphlet since I have 
seen that you have already committed a fix to trunk.

But is silver/trunk now identical to Tim's "gold-to-be" branch?

Done. But cannot we also use SVN to generate the ChangeLog file from the 
SVN log? Or is this not common practice?

Hope things work out fine now. The build process needs a lot of clean 
up. It is very hard for a human to understand the relation of the makefiles.

Ralf

To my mind, there certainly will be things that need more testing
before they become candidate for inclusion in the official release
(Gold).  So, I see Gold as almost a subset of silver, in the 
sense that it contains mature stuff and silver may contain more
experimental facilities or improvements that are not ready yet for gold.
silver is kind of "preview."

For this to work out correctly, we need to know what patches are
applied to Gold.  That is, we don't require that Tim also maintain
Silver. But, Tim should send patches he applies to Gold or whateter
"fixed in the next release" refers to.  In other word, we need some
kind of "public record".

| 
| Done. But cannot we also use SVN to generate the ChangeLog file from
| the SVN log? Or is this not common practice?

Well, usually when I make modification, I describe that modification
right away in the ChangeLog before thinking of commit.  That way I
don't forget about things, hours or days later, when it comes to
commit.  That is why it is not common practice -- from my exprience.
But if you find it easier for you; that is OK too.  As long as we have
a "history" file that is not SVN oriented.

Yup.  I'll commit in a moment an initial setup where I have just
"translated" the existing configure.  Then I'll move more work there.
Ideally, I would like to see this finished before end of month --
before I point students to working on/with Axiom.

I'll diff my latest with patch-49 and post the diffs.
But that has to be later. I have an impressive work schedule to do first.

Although the FrontPage is the FrontPage of the Axiom Wiki, unlike
other pages on the wiki, we decided not to let visitors modify it,
otherwise we might be just a little to open to vandalism. So for the
Axiom Wiki FrontPage it is true that only a handful of people can
actually modify it.

Why do you think it is "complicated for good citizens to contribute
changes"? I think it is very very significant (and disappointing to
me) that you perceive the Axiom Wiki this way. What can we do to
assure everyone that it fact that it is easy to contribute changes?
Afterall, that is the main reason that it is a Wiki.

This is another very important observation. I have to admit that
contrary to my "great expectations" it seems to me that so far we
have gained very little benefit from trying to maintain the Axiom
website as a wiki. It is true (for the most part) that the maintenance
of the contents of the Axiom web site (with the obvious exception of
the live Axiom and Reduce interface) could have been done using CVS
on Savannah or SourceForge. Contrary to the intent of the wiki, it
seems that almost all of the contributions to the Axiom web site
have been by people who are also active Axiom developers and are
quite familiar with using tools like CVS.

As I have said several times already, I am quite disappointed by
the lack of active contributions to the Axiom Wiki. Perhaps people
just do not have time or the motivation? I would be very surprised
if the reason was because they found it difficult to do, although
there does seem to be a considerable reluctance for people to view
the web as a two-way media where they can (or even are expected to)
contribute content. It seems to me that this is more a "cultural"
issue than a technical one.

In the last couple of years the only wildly successful wiki-based
project that I can think of is Wikipedia. At the present time the
only explanation I have for this is that apparently the ratio of
the number of people willing to contribute to the number of people
who just visit for information is very small - maybe as high as
1 out of 100,000. This would be consistant with the success of
Wikipedia and also the level of contribution that we see in Axiom
Wiki based on our month access statistics.

Anyway, I would very much like to hear from other Axiom developers
about the issue of whether it makes sense to continue to try to
maintain the main Axiom web site as a Wiki.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello,

Summer cleaning !!!

I also think the web page is too cluttered.

There is three category of people new comers, user and contributors.

About the new comers : we are competing to get their attention and time.

We need to be very good at it because Axiom is complex so it is not going to
be an easy  sell.

For them it should be the principle of minimum surprise and maximum
simplicity.
( Next  is a description of me looking at a project I might use, therefore
interpret the "I want" has I really expect to see)

If their is two column I will only read the left one.
(When we discuss the web page with Ralf today I even had forgotten about the
right one I remember only the logo and was surprise to see link.)
Also I expect the "This site" to be on the top right corner.
Our current top of the page do not make any sense, it is pure confusion to
me.

Also the left menu is too long, and redundant :
 Audio/visual <http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomScreenCast>  audio ???
not common confusing.
Press releases <http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/PressReleases> I have doubt
the general press is going to be interested by us really soon.
Gold Silver , the Olympics maybe ?

What I like is a News section where I can see that a project is alive.
( Also I like a related project link where I can see other CAS, I love it, I
think it is fair play)

I want a "Description" two page long maximum with what is Axiom what is
special and great about it.
I want a screen shoot , yes sorry I always want a screen shoot even for a
cmd line programs.
And then I want a Download with maybe some binary but for sure a tgz of the
source.
I will grab it, type ./configure, make, make install and try.

Then I am going to look for a good introduction. And I hate it when people
give me choice I want the one and definitive introduction. I will read
between 5 and 20 pages max. Any document that go over 100 pages will scare
me to death. A good indicator for me is if I feel ok to print it.
And if I survive I will look for more advanced material.

For the axiom user. We should not expect him to subscribe to the mailing
list.
He will go to the web page to solve his problems and get new version.
Here it is good FAQ, oriented tutorial, documentation and search able mail
list.
Subscribing to a mailing list is a big step, we should not expect people to
do it.

For active user/ contributors/ developer what is needed is a collaboration
tool, I have no answer for that.

Personally I find the wiki difficult to use, it seem a big mess to me and I
spend a lot of time looking for documents I saw before and know should be
somewhere. It lack structure and search will not replace that,  in general
giving a name to your problem is the difficult part.

When you look at the tree structure you see a big mess and all the bugs !

About people contribution :
I almost never find wiki useful.
Wiki as documentation is always an unpleasant mess.
I found comments useful( I think it is the MySQL documentation, it has user
comments at the end of each section, you always find clarification and
corner case described).

And modifying a page is not has easy at it sound. Writing correctly is time
consuming and difficult. I never feel like touching other people stuff. You
can often see it in a wiki where old information is rarely deleted.


So in the end it is a question of balance between people contribution and
time saved not doing it against mess and quality.

I think a fix web page with a few editors and keeping the wiki as a play
ground is the best solution. But easy to say because I am not volunteering
to be an editor.

Also just doing a good cleaning of the wiki might be what we need.

Regards
Antoine Hersen

Hello everyone,

It seems that modifications to the axiom wiki frontpage has become a
hot topic. I do not see the frontpage that much cluttered, but surely
improvements can be made.

Compared to the other Computer Algebra Systems web pages, I do see the
axiom-developer much more advance and  more user friendly. Their idea
of simplicity, is having couple of links in a fix page, that has not
been updated in years. Simplicity in web pages is measured by: "can I
get what I need in the least amount of clicks".

I do think that probably axiom-developer should morph to a hybrid
between static pages and a wiki page similar to www.ubuntu.com. There
the wiki is used for collaboration among users. Maybe this could
reduce the work load on Bill that has to maintain the wiki, and the
fight the tedious spam problem.

I do not know what was the first expectation with the Wiki. In our
part (Doyen), the Wiki is the foundation of Tim's idea. Maybe it was
expected to do contributions to Axiom directly to the wiki, some kind
of online development environment. This to me is a great idea. But
apparently this is not occurring by reading Bill's comments.

For me the wiki is very useful. Everytime I have to remember some
comment, I need to improve the Doyen, I can find the information
really quick. The Wiki allows me also to see the work done for Axiom,
were it is right now, and the future plans. This cannot be done by
using static pages, and it is much faster than wasting time looking in
mailings lists.

Regarding the frontpage I think the audio/visual section should be
very relevant, together with screenshots. I think this is the
"screenshots" section in many pages, which usually is the most popular
to new comers.Probably more appealing screenshots are needed.

Just my 2 cents.

Regards,

Alfredo Portes

| Although the FrontPage is the FrontPage of the Axiom Wiki, unlike

I don't propose we make the frontpage freely modifiable.  Quite the
contrary.  I'm very happy that only a handful of trusted people will
have write access to that page.  This is why I come to the observation
that having the frontpage as a wiki does not look to me like a plus or
an improvement over others sites we've been comparing to.

[...]

| have been by people who are also active Axiom developers and are
| quite familiar with using tools like CVS.

Although I'm not a great fan of wiki (probably because I'm showing my
age :-)), I do understand and see what might be its benefits.  And as
a matter of fact, I've found some wiki pages very useful.

However, I find more useful to be able to work offline -- that is I
don't need to connect to the web before being able to browse the
wealth of information.  This is because I don't always work online.
Having the same (at least a good part of) information in some form
that does not require connectivity is great.  I don't propose we
duplicate effort.  I'm just observing.

| As I have said several times already, I am quite disappointed by
| the lack of active contributions to the Axiom Wiki.

In its current form, how many people (say posting to this list) know
Axiom, have time to document and go online and have fun with Wiki?

First, we need a critical mass.  Anything we can do to lower the entry
barrier is good.  I'm just giving my feedback about some of the
current setup.


[...]

| Anyway, I would very much like to hear from other Axiom developers
| about the issue of whether it makes sense to continue to try to
| maintain the main Axiom web site as a Wiki.

I don't propose you destroy eveything :-)

Most certainly I have not seen suggestions to replace the wiki with

current situations.  I was giving my feedback about what need
improvements.

Hi,

   Instead of fiddling at infinitum with the new build machinery on my
local disk.  I decided to trim it down to something "simple" to
request feedback about some aspects of the work.

   The core goal is to move Axiom's build system to GNU Autotools which
have become quite standard now, in the Unix-world.

   For that I've converted the current configure file to configure.ac
(which Autoconf will use to regenerate configure).  The main
motivation here is factor out many platforms variability issues and
dump them on Autoconf -- who already knows how to solve them.

   Axiom has the requirement that the source files must be literate --
use of pamphlet files.  Autoconf expects its input to be in particular
form.  Furthermore, the pamphlet file requirement introduces an
unpleasant bootstrapping issue that will hopefully be resolved.
So, in its current form, I put the literate stuff in comments, so that
if you do

    cat configure.ac | sed -e 's/^## //' > configure.tex

you can an almost LaTeX file.  "Almost" because LaTeX commands need to
start with a backslash.  That character used to be reserved for line
continuation in shell world.  So to avoid any surprise, I used the
percent character (which unfortunately is LaTeX comment character).  So
to get the LaTeX document, one needs to apply another sed that
replaces the percent character with the backslash character.

I've tested that I can feed the file to Autoconf, get a configure file
out of it and launch a successful build.

This work is being done on the "build-improvements" branch -- and it
has not been committed there yet.

Before painting myself into a corner, I would like to have feedbacks
from all y'all.

Thanks.

## I have been trying to write this Autoconf file so that it can
## eventually be processed by both Autoconf and noweb -- the currently en
## vogue literate programming tool used by Axiom.  To accommodate that
## requirement, I've strived for introducing noweb chunkname in
## %code{dnl}-style comments, whereas text intended to be part of the text
## processed by LaTeX is introduced by %verb!## !  This is so that the
## poor masochist who will be debugging the generated %file{configure} file
## (if he/she so elected) has a clue about where the macros are expanded
## from and what their purposes are.

## %section{Basic Setup}
## %subsection{Autoconf Initialization}
## 
## The Autoconf machinery needs to be initialized with several pieces of
## information:
## %begin{itemize}
## %item the %emph{name} of the system --- ``Axiom silver branch''
## %item its %emph{version}.  I choose to use the date of last checkin.
##   It should probably include the revision number so as to 
##   unambiguously identify which Axiom flavour du jour is being
##   built;
## %item and where to send feedback, %emph{e.g.} bug reports.  I have chosen
##   the %email{axiom-developer} list.  That could change in the future if
##   we reach a high volume traffic.  For the moment, we don't seem to
##   suffer from traffic...
## %end{itemize}
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_INIT([Axiom silver branch], [2006-07-15], [axiom-developer@nongnu.org])
dnl %end{chunk}

## Autoconf needs some auxilary files that are present in the sub-directory
## %file{config}.  Autoconf needs to be told about that.
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(config)
dnl %end{chunk}

## Notice that since we don't use Automake (yet), we don't initialize
## the Automake subsystem.  

## We require Autoconf 2.59 or higher from the developer part. Please,
## note that this is no requirement on the user build environment.  All,
## it means is that if someone makes changes to the current %file{configure.ac}
## file, that someone needs to have Autoconf 2.59 or higher to process this
## file in order to regenerate %file{configure}.
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_PREREQ([2.59])
dnl %end{chunk}

## The Autoconf system implements a very basic, simple-minded, sanity check
## whereby it will refuse to run %file{configure} if the source tree does
## not contain a specified file, that serves a witness for a bona fide source
## tree.  Here, I have chosen %file{Makefile.pamphlet} from the %file{src}
## subdirectory.
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(src/Makefile.pamphlet)
dnl %end{chunk}


## %subsection{Build Environment}
## 
## Standard build environments consist of
## %begin{enumerate}
## %item the %emph{host} platform,
## %item the %emph{build} platform, and
## %item the %emph{target} platform.
## %end{enumerate}
## FIXME: Example on these notions.
## 
## Get the canonical names for the above three platforms.  After call to
## this macro, those values are available in the variables %code{host},
## %code{build}, and %code{target}, respectively.
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
dnl %end{chunk}

## For the moment, we don't support cross-compiling, nor Canadian cross.
## Consequently, we must bail out if the build is not native.
dnl %begin{chunk}
if test $host != $build -o $host != $target; then
   AC_MSG_ERROR([Sorry, only native builds are currently supported])
fi
dnl %end{chunk}

## Check for a C compiler, %textsl{GCC/gcc} preferably.
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_PROG_CC
dnl %end{chunk}

## Check for a usable 'install' program.
dnl %begin{chunk}
AC_PROG_INSTALL
dnl %end{chunk}


## The old build machinery needs 'awk'.  Currently, it checks for
## 'gawk', 'nawk', and 'awk'.  Autoconf has a predefined test for that
## task.  It checks for 'gawk', 'mawk', 'nawk', and 'awk' in that order.
## That should be OK and match Axiom's need.

## The old build system claims that on solaris9, gawk, gtar 
## and gpatch are required (with no much explanation of why).  Notice
## that these programs are needed only to build Axiom; so we do
## check based on the value of %code{build}.

There was not direct mention of mailing list, but previous posts
mentioned that they did not see the use of the Wiki. Wikis are a
better way of collaboration. You can see how every major Open Source
project have put in place a wiki for this purpose.

I do agree with you that maybe certain things could be done in the
front page to access the information faster. This is always the goal.
Probably improvement to the links can be done. Bill has pointed out
that the wiki has an index in the frontpage. I did not know that and
it is very useful. Maybe it should be place in another place, more
visible in the frontpage. Also, including a Search label, for the
label text box, maybe people miss it some times.

I just wanted to comment in the importance of the Wiki and the great
work that the
axiom-developer wiki is.

Regards,

The untangle that creates Makefile is embedded in the script
${DOCUMENT} =3D 'document'. I agree that it is a bit obscure.
Probably it should be separate.

You can find 'document' in the src/scripts directory.

First of all, I'd like to thank Bill for all the effort he has put into
the Wiki.

In some points I must, however, agree with Antoine. The current Wiki
currently is a bit of a mess. There are only a few pages that are of
real value. You know, when I started I had hard times to find my way
through the information that I was looking for and even now I don't find
things that I am looking for in a few clicks.

Until somebody posted the BeBold principle to the mailing list I was
always hesitating not to edit/delete too much of the existing
information, but surely that slowed down improvements to the wiki. Now I
am a bit bolder, but it is still hard.

If I look now at some pages, I would rather like to see that information
organised in a different way, but different from a text in a
text-editor, I cannot simply drag & drop text from one page to another.
Well, I should have open several browser windows, I know.

What is also important is some more structure of the wiki. I am
personally used to linear text with sections and subsections, ie, some
kind of hierarchy. We should have a number of standard pages that can be
edited only by registered Axiom-developers. These pages should not
change too much once they are set up. But hey, until now we only had
problem with spam, but not with people willingly destroying pages. So
restricting the wiki idea at this stage of Axiom is an unnecessary
effort, there are too few edits anyway. To ALL: Start improving the wiki
pages!!! If you don't like something then change it!!!

Bill, what I would like to see on top of an edit page is a link to
BeBold. Furthermore, it should be said that the first paragraph of the
page is a kind of abstract that is used for the "SiteMap" (which can be
considered as a kind of glossary, if you like).

Actually, I would also like to have some facility that let's me move the
  pages in the tree structure of the wiki. Best would be to see the tree
and take my mouse to move pages in the hierarchy.

I feel the same, but the right column doesn't disturb me too much. In
fact, I like it, since it gives related material. Only having both "Site
Index" and "Site Map", I find a bit confusing. Maybe one should be
called by a more appropriate name. I cannot easily guess what is what. I
don't like to see the IssueTracker pages on the siteindex/sitemap. It is
too distracting from the hierarchy view.

Don't we have it somewhere? Haven't I seen this on one of Tim's pages?

Yes, I have already put a section into SandboxAxiomSource. I just don't
know where the .tgz and friends are. Or would just a file be just too
huge? In that case we declare on SandboxAxiomSource why we don't give a
.tgz file.

> Then I am going to look for a good introduction. And I hate it when 
> people give me choice I want the one and definitive introduction.

I think we should take this consideration seriously. Currently
"Tutorial" links to "AxiomInterface" (very intuitive!) and gives not a
tutorial. I rather think that we should maybe give a weighted list of
introductory material.

http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~mnd/documentation/axiom_tutorial

The above tutorial looks quite reasonable to me. The tutorial page
should not be like a sandbox were everyone just adds his/her commands.

I hate everything on http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomInterface that
comes after the "That was easy!". It should go away, because it looks
unprofessional.

> I will read between 5 and 20 pages max. Any document that go over 100
> pages will scare me to death.

So the Axiom Book should come at the end of the tutorial under "Further 
Reading".

I also felt like it. We all know that we can unroll changes, but what I 
don't know is, whether everyone can do it. It should be more obvious how 
things can and will be undone if people are too bold. Another suggestion 
that should be visible on top of an edit-page.

I also think we should have a mixture of pages that only a few people 
can edit and freely editable pages. But I strongly think that it is too 
early to make that distinction. We first need more people who edit at all.

Your email to axiom-mail was queued along with the usual 30 or so
spam messages because when you sent the message to axiom-mail you
were not registered as a user (at least not under the email address
that you used to send the message). The amount of spam these days
is simply horrendous so the chances are quite high that if you
are not registered as a user first before sending an email to the
list, it will might well be deleted. I try to review the queued
"spam candidates" at least once a day but I don't give more than
a few seconds to each email before hitting the "discard" button.

I suppose that you got a bounce message from the email list saying
that it had been held. Right?

In this case I did happen to see your email, so I hit "pass" and
it has just been distributed to the list.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Tim, wouldn't it be easier to just put your "gold-to-be" archive as a 
tla mirror to the web? So we would always be up-to-date.

Right, that was also one of my concerns some time ago. Bill helped be 
quite a lot with mirrory the Wiki locally on my computer, but I must say 
that it did not make me completely happy. I would have to download a big 
zope database and I cannot easily push back changes that I would make 
locally to the wiki. It is just too much to install and not everything 
works perfectly. I would also be happy to have all the information 
available when I am offline, work on Axiom and commit modifications back 
to a server so that they become visible for others.

I think currently the Wiki should be a means to attract people and maybe 
to try out axiom commands only. But I am very much in favour of putting 
valuable information into the SVN/TLA repositories. Maybe the volume 
about axiom development is a good place to describe the building process 
more accurately. But that is "Further Reading" for an ordinary axiom 
user. ;-)

If this is the case then the literate document describing the target
${SRC}/scripts/Makefile should mention this behaviour. (And better 
still, the Makefiles would be linked together and a click on ${DOCUMENT} 
jumps to its definition and maybe from value of DOCUMENT there is a link 
to the file and another click into the .dvi and my editor opens inside 
the documentation of the "document" command.)

We have a long way to go...

Are you referring to the problem of the noweb dependency? I think
this is not so much of a problem if we treat it properly as a
dependency.

configure.ac itself should be a named chunk - probably in the main
Makefile.pamphlet. This might make regenerating ./configure a little
more complex than usual but not much.

Most open source installations ship a pre-generated ./configure
file and I think Axiom should be no different.

The first thing ./configure should do is check for noweb and tell
you what to do about it if it is not found. One "last resort" option
to ./configure can be to build and install noweb from the sources
supplied with Axiom. But in general Axiom should not be in the
business of re-distributing noweb.

All this looks like a horrible hack to me - unless I am missing
something fairly basic. What is wrong with the usual way of using
noweb?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thanks for the feedback.  Let me, first, merge your changes to silver,
then commit mine to build-improvements.  I'll send you a ping for
testing. 

Are you comfortable with the approach of my ad-hoc approach to
literacy here that is not mainstream Axiom not ALLPROSE?  What would
you suggest?

The current "Online sources" are actually pamphlet files implemented
as wiki pages. Some details are provided here

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/210

You might also wish to review the history of pamphlet file support
on the wiki in the axiom-developer email list.

The main idea here is to provide direct support (including editing
and noweb) for pamphlet files through the wiki interface. But more
needs to be done to integrate this with the rest of the Axiom build
process.

The 'axiom--test--1' pages correspond to what the Axiom sources
were about last August, 2005. There have been some online updates -
especially those required to allow Axiom Wiki to generate hypertex
dvi and pdf files, but none of these changes have been propagated
back to the original sources (either gold or silver). I used a
different name 'axiom--test--1' as a reminder that this source
is not either of these.

The original idea was to have a way to periodically merged these
changes, but that has not been implemented yet. And of course it
is desirable to merge changes from gold (or maybe better silver)
to the "online sources". This also has to been implemented.

And most ambitiously, one could have an automatic build process
that built Axiom directly from the current online sources and if
it was successful, automatically run a series of "test" wiki pages
containing Axiom commands and expected results.

But all of this is just duplicating through-the-web, processes that
are normally accomplished using the more conventional approach.
It is a kind of experiment to see how much we can do with the wiki-
based approach. I still think it is rather sexy, but until (or if)
Axiom developers show more interest in this concept, I am rather
reluctant to spend more of my time on this experiment.

But...

There are alternatives for browsing online source code directly
from source repositories. I have for example also implemented the
darcsweb cgi script that enables browsing the darcs repository. Go to

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MathActionRepository

and click on "browsed online", then click on "axiom--main--1".

The axiom--main--1 darcs repository corresponds to the actual version
of Axiom running on the axiom-developer.org server that runs Axiom Wiki
and Axiom Portal. It is currently in synch with the arch axiom--main--1
repository because I just recently updated the version of Axiom.

darcsweb is described here:

http://auriga.wearlab.de/~alb/darcsweb/

I think there are similar online source browsers for arch (tla), cvs
and subversion. Maybe the link to the "Online source" should be to
one of these instead of to 'axiom--test--1'.

But of course these browsers do not allow online update of the source
code.

That sounds good to me.

| Are you referring to the problem of the noweb dependency? I think

| dependency.

Currently, it if one modifies the toplevel Makefile.pamphlet, one also
needs to regenerate the corresponding Makefile.  I don't want that.

All Makefiles should be generated at configured time.

Furthermore, one needs to have noweb in order to regenerate it.  If
the target system needs to build noweb, we are hosed.  We don't want.

All that is elimintated by not having to regenarate Makefile before
actual configuration.


| configure.ac itself should be a named chunk - probably in the main
| Makefile.pamphlet. This might make regenerating ./configure a little
| more complex than usual but not much.

configure will swamp the generation of all Makefiles from the
corresponding pamphlets.  Consequently I don't want to tie the
generation of configure to Makefiles that way.  We don't need that
bootstrapping problem.

| Most open source installations ship a pre-generated ./configure
| file and I think Axiom should be no different.

Yes, that is what we will do.  That configure is generated by Autoconf
based on configure.ac.  Autoconf does not expect pamphlet files.
Autoconf want an input in a language it understands. Consequently, we
must present configure.ac in a way appropriate for Autoconf.
Therefore we cannot depend on noweb (notangle).

In my current system, the only dependency of configure on makefiles is
when the makefiles are "touched" in a way that needs reconfiguration;
and way to extract the documentation out of configure.ac.

| The first thing ./configure should do is check for noweb and tell
| you what to do about it if it is not found.

Yes, that is what is done in my current local tree.  That is one
reason why we don' want configure.ac to depends on noweb.

| One "last resort" option
| to ./configure can be to build and install noweb from the sources
| supplied with Axiom. But in general Axiom should not be in the
| business of re-distributing noweb.

That is also an implemented option in my current system.

See the explanations above.

This is a hack; I agree.  No more horrible than what we currently do
with noweb.  However, I don't like it.  That is why I called for
discussion and suggestions for improvements :-)

To sum up.

We need

  (1) to write configure.ac directly in a language understood by Autoconf;
  (2) a way to get the documentation out of configure.ac
  (3) no dependency of configure.ac (and therefore configure) on noweb.

For the long term, all Makefiles should be generated at configure time.

I suspect that is due to Axiom not being seen as "simple" to use, whether or

I would expect this to be true.  Also, remember there is the additional 
barrior of learning Axiom itself, in addition to the wiki mindset.  The tools 
are very powerful but like all powerful tools there is a minimum skill level 
which must first be obtained before they can be effectively used.

And the skill level requried to contribute there seems to be ~= 0, and the 
topic list is much broader than mathematics and science.  It's amazing that 
it has worked as well as it has, but there is a VERY active and dedicated 
core group of people that fights off a continuing incoming stream of garbage.

Yes, I expect this is true.

Some features of Axiom's website I very much like - for example, the Emacs 
mode pamphlet was uploaded effortlessly and a complete online set of 
documents in available formats was generated and downloadable.  The same for 
each incrimental edit.  This is the best such system I have ever seen, and 
IMHO it should be preserved.

The source code being online in axiom--test--1 I also like very much - it's 
extremely convenient to have it available in that form, and as the source 
code becomes true literate documents we effectively have an entire research 
library on our website :-).

The ability to have Axiom sessions which display well formatted output via 
graphics from user input is very good as well.  The SAGE project might be an 
even better outlet for this type of work - I haven't looked closely at it 
yet - but Axiom's system is certainly one of the very best on the web and I 
hope to see it continue.

I don't know how many of these features are due to the wiki nature of the 
website though.  As to the ability of anybody to edit and change pages - 
except for experimentation without on-computer software installation ala the 
sandbox, I don't think I see much benefit to this, to be honest.  Science, 
mathematics, computer science, and the other subjects Axiom deals with are 
not simple or casual pursuits for most people, and I think anyone capable of 
doing work significant to the project would also be able to handle 
interacting with a more "traditional" website structure, with 
one "experimental area" for trying out basic stuff.  Think about it this 
way - if some paper appeared on our wiki, from someone we didn't know who did 
not further contact or become involved with the project, how would we react 
to it?  My first reaction would be that the author probably wasn't all that 
serious about what they were doing (that might not be fair, I know).  Many 
people have put up good work on wikis, including Axiom's, (the Guess work 
being one of many examples) but those peopel are almost all known to us 
through their other work as well.  Also, if we want to use such a work, does 
posting it to the wiki implicitly release it as BSD licensed?  Who would do 
the quality check needed before it became part of the "main" code base?   It 
often takes quite a lot of work to spot a good "fake" paper, and that's why 
peer reviewed journals have the inertia they do.  Reputations must be earned 
for work to be taken seriously.  Tim's idea with an Axiom journal is a good 
one - I would expect that once established that venue would produce more 
usable work than a wiki would.  Sort of like the ToC effort - credible names, 
reputations, and authors are needed to attract serious published works.  
Serious developers would publish through that community rather than use an 
anonymously writable wiki, and so any wiki work ends up being seen as at best 
an amateur effort and at worst internet background noise.  Wikipedia has to 
work hard to remain useful, and their goal is only general information, not 
in-depth highly correct mathematical and scientific papers.

The Axiom portal, on the other hand, I do find very useful for 
individual "storage" of works in progress, relevant bits of information, etc.  
Is that a wiki-like system?

I don't pretend to have all the answers - just my thoughts on the subject.  I 
have a tremendous respect Bill for the work you have done, which has produced 
the best online mathematics website I have seen to date, and I don't know if 
my much less informed opinions are of use.

Cheers,
Cliff

Heh - glad you like it.  I was the one who came up with the initial design for 
that site, although it has been helped quite a lot since then by others.  It 
uses one file for the menu and validates (or it used to) in the w3c 
validator.  It's far less sophisticated than the Axiom website though.

It might be that the Maxima website is a bit more structured generally.  I'm 
probably the wrong person to compare how clean and accessible the two sites 
are since I had a hand in the Maxima website - I can try and offer specific 
suggestions if they are of interest.

For the number of people active now, I think we do have too many.  Maybe we 
could do this - make the other email lists "dormant" until axiom-devel begins 
to be overwhelmed with traffic that isn't dev related, and then re-activate 
them as needed.  Except axiom-legal - those discussions can get very long and 
we need a place to dump them ;-).

I know the question isn't addressed to me but I might suggest a bit of a 
different arrangement for the downloading information (guess that's not 
exactly front page though.)  I'll try and work on it some tonight and come up 
with a more concrete suggestion.

Cheers,
Cliff

Hmmm... exactly what is it that we are trying to sell? :)

Do you not feel that this might be quite misleading to such
new comers? After all, I do not think either of these
principles apply to Axiom - and some of the reason for this
depends on design choices that are specific to Axiom. I mean
specifically Axiom's type system.

I think this means that right up front we have to admit to
ourselves that Axiom may not have much appeal to most new
comers. But perhaps there is a class of "new comers" consisting
of experianced computer algebra users who have not had previous
exposure to Axiom. I think it is these people who might be most
receptive to the reasons why things are done "differently" in
Axiom.

Wow! That seems like a big admission to me. Is that also how
you read the newpaper and computer magazines? ;) I admit that
I also am very selective about what I read on a web page, but
not that selective...

Do you mean the line:

home contents changes issues preferences help  +/-
  full/simple/minimal navigator  subscribe backlinks diff edit
    (external edit icon)=20

It is obvious, isn't it? that this is the top menu bar similar
to what you see on almost all window applications?

Surely some of these menu items must also be obvious to you?
E.g. 'home', 'help', 'edit' etc.

Could you say exactly what you find confusing? Keeping in
mind that this is a wiki web site, could you suggest how we
can make it less confusing?

One way, maybe, would be to completely hide that fact that this
is a wiki page by removing the top menu bar on the FrontPage.

Really? Many web sites use audio, especially ScreenCasts.

I have in mind more specific "press" such as computer magazines
and online "news" sources such as SlashDot etc. Maybe the name
"press releases" is a bit misleading?

Right now the best place for this is "changes" on the main menu
bar that you said was confusing to you but it is also in the
right sidebar as Whats New under This Site.

It would be nice to have a nicely formatted wiki page specifically
for this purpose but then we would need someone willing to keep it
up to date.

Do you mean expand the Related Sites box on the right sidebar?

Do you mean something like

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AboutAxiom

which is already accessible from several links on the current
FrontPage?

I wonder why it did not seem obvious to you to click "Audio/visual"?
Could you suggest a change of wording that would have made this
more obvious? I am trying hard here not to appear defensive or
critical. I am serious that we badly need suggestions on how
to word things so that the purpose is obvious on first reading.
I know that this might be difficult to achieve for all people
reading this web site from around the world, but we should at
least try.

Right now the only static screen shots that we have are for
Axiom with TeXmacs.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Screenshots

It would be great if someone could take the time to contribute
a few more.

The 'Download' link on the FrontPage does lead quite quickly
to binary and source code tgz. How can we improve that?

I have to agree that we lack a good introduction. But "the one
and definitive introduction" is rather hard to write for Axiom
I think. Perhaps you would be willing to create a draft? Maybe
we can try to write such an introduction in a collaborative
way?

I find that a rather surprising statement. As a user of new
open source software that is one of the first things that I
expect to have to do. One of the things that people repeatedly
claim for open source software is that the email lists of most
open source projects is a much better source of help and
information that any traditional help resource for commercial
software.

I agree that the current Axiom tutorial information could be
much better organized. Do you have any suggestions about how
to do this?

On the Axiom Wiki it is also possible for users to "subscribe"
to specific web pages. Did you notice the word 'subscribe' in
the top menu line? This allows people to automatically receive
notices of new or changed web pages without having to subscribe
to the email list. Do you think this is a useful feature?

Axiom Wiki? Or do you mean that what we have now does work as

I am surprised that you say "what is needed is a collaboration
tool" and then you say immediately after that you find the wiki
difficult to use. I wonder what you have in mind when you say
"collaboration"?

> It lack structure and search will not replace that, in general

Of course there are alternatives to search such as the Site Map
and Site Index links on the right sidebar. But I agree in general
that the structure of the web pages on the Axiom Wiki web site
could be improved.

I did try to make some progress toward improving this structure
by introducing the new Up/Down navigation links on the left side
of each page (except FrontPage). My intention is to make the
structure of the pages more obvious and more useful for "navigating"
(i.e. manually searching) through the web site. Do you think that
is useful?

Note: What is Up and what is down can be changed by clicking
on 'backlinks' from the top menu bar. Maybe that is not obvious.
Can you suggest another way to introduce the concept of the
page structure?

> When you look at the tree structure you see a big mess and all
> the bugs !

Well, it is not really a tree structure. Each page can be linked
to several pages both "up" and "down". So it is really a lattice
(to a mathematician) or an ontology (to at least one branch of
computer science).

When you say "all the bugs" do you mean the issue tracker pages?
These to not appear in most of the links on the left sidebar.
Or do you mean when you look it the overall structure under
'contents'? Because we have over 300 such issue reports (about
the same number as all other contents of the web site), these
do tend to dominate any listing of contents. Perhaps we need a
way to suppress these from the main contents list and only
show them on a more detailed contents list?
=09
> About people contribution :

Can you say why you do not find it useful?

>  Wiki as documentation is always an unpleasant mess.

Do you not think the word "always" is too strong? I can give
some examples where it is very good (e.g. Wikipedia) and others
where it is not so good. Of course the quality of the contents
of a wiki depend directly on the contributions of users. Perhaps
what you are saying is equivalent to saying that the users of
software like Axiom are not qualified (or not willing?) to
contribute to it's documentation? Or are your comments really
specific to documentation done via a wiki?

> I found comments useful( I think it is the MySQL documentation,

Is this not like what you see on the current Axiom Wiki?

> And modifying a page is not has easy at it sound. Writing

This is just an attitude that can be changed by experience
isn't it?

I agree. My conclusion is that we do not have nearly enough
people willing to contribute. For me, time saved is time not
"stolen" from other projects (and paying work) that also
deserve my attention. I am sure that this is similar to many
other people who currently contribute to Axiom.

How can we solve this problem if no one volunteers to be editor -
not even editor of their own wiki pages?

Please give even a few simple suggestions about what needs to
be cleaned? What can we delete? What things already exist on
the web site that can be linked into a more useful structure?

Thanks again for all you comments.

I understand that.  I also believe we must attract those who had no

attract experienced computer algebra users, we will be in trouble.
In a good healthy community, "young" or "newbies" must be larger than
"old" or "experienced" people.  We do want the newbies to become very
quickly experienced though :-)  That takes time.  Still.

I believe what Antoine says here is not unique.  Ideally, even when

selective reading they have :-/

If I understand the question, you are asking how we can have only literate 
program files in Axiom at the get go and still not depend on noweb.  The 
simple answer is, we can't.

I suppose I'm dense, but I thought it would end up like this:

1)  Have configure.ac and configure.ac.pamphlet both present in the top level 
directory.  configure.ac.pamphlet is where editing is done, and when a commit 
is made (for this one file) a configure.ac file is also committed (or even 
autogenerated by the server, if we want to go so far as to configure it to do 
so.)

2)  Extracting the documentation out of configure.ac.pamphlet would require 
the use of the notangle command, or once we have a lisp noweb using that 
tool. 

I've always wondered why LaTeX itself couldn't handle processing a pamphlet 
file as a regular latex file  - after all, couldn't it just replace 
<<chunckname>> [content] @ by a fancy version of \begin{verbatium}[content] 
\end{verbatium} or some such?  You would still need a notangle command to 
extract source code, but at least you could read the documentation without 
needing anything more than LaTeX.

That's why we will need to have both configure.ac and configure.ac.pamphlet.  
This will always be true if we want to avoid having the end user manually use 
some other tool to extract the first file, whether it is configure.ac or some 
other file.  As long as configure.ac.pamphlet is written and maintained in 
the .pamphlet file I don't see a problem with special casing the continual 
presence of configure.ac  - it's pretty much inevitable.

I understand the desire to be able to bootstrap, but there is no way around 
it - we must have one non-pamphlet file present to kickstart the process.  
Personally I would suggest two or three - a set of Bash and Windows script 
files containing all the autoconf and other incantantations the user would 
need to make might simplify matters even more.

I don't think we should fear a couple of non-pamphlet files being present in 
the top level directory - indeed, it will simplify matters considerably from 
the user standpoint.  They won't know (and may not want to know) what a 
pamphlet file is all about - they just want to build and use the math program 
to do math.  In that case, the complete absence of anything familiar will 
turn them off.

I would suggest the minimal (and maybe maximal) set of:

README
configure.ac
buildaxiom.sh
buildaxiom_windows.<whatever windows uses>

README should be in basic, no frills ASCII text - about as universally 
readable as you can get.  It should explain a little about Axiom, and how to 
get started building it (tools needed, etc.)

There is no way to bootstrap without a "lower level" file present to kick the 
process off, unless (as you already attempted) the higher level files are 
also legal lower level files.  I don't think we want to redefine the literate 
strategy we use to that degree - it's not worth it.

In a way, it's the same problem Tim faced with Axiom being needed to build 
Axiom.  The only way out was (and still is) to have some files in lisp 
present, to teach lisp to read and understand BOOT and SPAD.  Same deal here.  
It's a universal problem - if we wanted to bootstrap a machine from a cold, 
memoryless, powerless state we would need some binary to feed it before it 
could start speaking assembly. True bootstrapping is a very rare event ;-).  
Normally even new platforms have their software cross compiled from other 
platforms, since the human beings involved don't want to make the translation 
themselves.  Anyway, that's another topic.

1 and 3 are solved by always having a current notangle of configure.ac present 
in the tree at all times.  As for two, I think we should assume a working 
notangle is available.  We have to assume SOMETHING is working, and since the 
generated document needs LaTeX to be processed I think the additional 
assumption of notangle (particularly if configure.ac can build it) is 
acceptable.

Agreed.

A wish because if I wanted it so badly I will have done it myself.

We want people time, first we want people to use Axiom and then we want
people to work on Axiom.

I was thinking mainly about the web page.
But it is true that axiom has a lot of complicated ideas and we should be
clear about their respective advantages.

People tend to use the simplest tool possible for their problem( not a bad
idea in general) become familiar with it and use it more and more, at what
point even if the tool is not a good fit anymore people dont know or dont
see the advantage of learning a new tool that will be seen has more complex.

And I think Axiom fit in the heavy tool category.

I think this means that right up front we have to admit to

The problem is those new comers are not "fresh" any more.
If you have been using MMA for some time, you need a good enough reason to
abandon all your experience and change tool.

So we need a sell speech !!!!!!

Also another category of user is people looking for a general CAS that is
open source, and even if those user may lack "sophistication" initially I
think we should still try to be attractive to them and offer support.

Dead tree ???? I like only shiny moving picture where every thing comes in
30 second chunk. Honestly I read a lot of books and magazine, even newspaper
when I am off the grid.

But I want to be able to scan rapidly a web page and find what might be of
interest to me.

I honestly find this top bar terrible.
The top of the page a very expansive piece of estate.
Look at the wikipedia one, as simple as possible.

I understand it is surely the wiki default and will be difficult to change
but still.

+/- ? does not work for me I imagine that it change the font size, I know
how to do that on my browser and I do not expect a web site to do this for
me.

For the front page I think it will be nicer especially as people can not

I dont know about screen cast( I do but dont tell), also audio + CAS makes
weird connection in my brain.

./ is meta content.

The axiom link in the central description I never clicked on it, I will have
no idea where it will lead me.

I think there should be a clear About it the top 3 on the left side.

That is something I have been talking about with a friend. There is two
things actually.
The subsection in the left menu  do not show as such they should be a bit
decalled or have some small bullet point.

And all the four title do not feel has link because every think you might
expect from them is detailed bellow.

I am not sure I am clear on this one.

Maybe we could give a try to this for a few day get rid of them no big
Documentation/Discussion/... the color should carry enough information.

And download should be above discussion.

Also testing does not convey best the idea of trying, and it should be
"online try" to emphasize it is not some sort of demo/download.

What about I give it a try :

About
News
Documentation
FAQ
Screenshots/Video
-----------
Online try
Download
---------
Developer
Mail list
Bug report
Bibliography
Related link

I am not sure about bib
On the left just the logo without colored frame around them.
Stats on the bottom

News should be able to fit in the front page.

And most important Axiom completely lack visual identity !!!
I am not suggesting that we change the logo, I like it ok, but it should be
made larger.
Almost banner size with a catch phrase.

I havent think about it much yet sorry.

No I hate it, getting a mail when somebody correct some spelling mistake.
And worse of all it is opt out !!! ( I think)

What I like is a release mailing list, when I get at maximum every 3 month a
mail telling me about a new version or some special events. He has to be
very low traffic.

Yes, a nice tree, where every think is accessible from the 1st page in some

I want a spanning tree.

When you say "all the bugs" do you mean the issue tracker pages?

That will be very nice indeed, do you think it can be easily done ?

<br>is a wiki page by removing the top menu bar on the FrontPage.</blockquote><div><br>For the front page I think it will be nicer especially as people can not edit it.<br></div><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
&gt; Also the left menu is too long, and redundant :<br>&gt; Audio/visual &lt;<a href="http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomScreenCast">http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomScreenCast</a>&gt;<br>&gt; audio ??? not common confusing.
<br><br>Really? Many web sites use audio, especially ScreenCasts.</blockquote><div><br>I dont know about screen cast( I do but dont tell), also audio + CAS makes weird connection in my brain.<br><br>What about :<br><br>Screenshots/Video

It would be nice to have a nicely formatted wiki page specifically<br>for this purpose but then we would need someone willing to keep it<br>up to date.<br><br>&gt; (Also I like a related project link where I can see other CAS,
<br>&gt; I love it, I think it is fair play)<br><br>Do you mean expand the Related Sites box on the right sidebar?</blockquote><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">

On the Axiom Wiki it is also possible for users to &quot;subscribe&quot;<br>to specific web pages. Did you notice the word 'subscribe' in<br>the top menu line? This allows people to automatically receive<br>notices of new or changed web pages without having to subscribe

Actually, we can if we don't insist that literate files must be

I would like to move away from the @ and [] fancy syntax.  But, that

| Personally I would suggest two or three - a set of Bash and Windows script

| 
| I would suggest the minimal (and maybe maximal) set of:
| 
| README
| configure.ac
| buildaxiom.sh
| buildaxiom_windows.<whatever windows uses>

The minimal setting should include

  configure                     -- generated by Autoconf; end-user stuff
  configure.ac                  -- generated by noweb, developer
  configure.ac.pamphlet         -- hand-edited, developer
  build-setup.sh                -- hand-edited; end-user stuff

build-setup.sh will abstract over all the low-level commands that
generate configure.ac from configure.ac.pamphlet, configure from
configure.ac -- and Makefile.am from Makefile.am.pamphlet when we
converts to Automake.

I'm not a windows developer, so I'll leave the windows stuff to others
(hi Bill).

| 
| There is no way to bootstrap without a "lower level" file present to kick the 
| process off,

I know.  configure.ac is that file.  And the point that started the
experiment is that once you've written configure.ac, there is very
little gained by putting it in a pamphlet file.  All the documentation
will need to be present in the final generated configure file.
Consequently, the low-level stuff here equals to the high-level variant.

| unless (as you already attempted) the higher level files are 
| also legal lower level files.  I don't think we want to redefine the literate 
| strategy we use to that degree - it's not worth it.

I'm really annoyed by the dependency on noweb to bootstrap the
process.  I would rather, by a large degree, vanilla traditional
tools, e.g. plain 'sed'.  However, I will proceed as outlined above, and 
will at the same time respectfully register my strong disagreement.

[...]

| In a way, it's the same problem Tim faced with Axiom being needed to build 
| Axiom.  The only way out was (and still is) to have some files in lisp 
| present, to teach lisp to read and understand BOOT and SPAD.  Same deal here.  
That is a good recipe for maintenance nightmarre -- recent debates about
redundant boot anyone?  There ought to be a better way to deal with it.  

In the case of configure.ac, I'm pretty convinced because I've tried
several ways.  The conclusion invariably is that there is no
difference between the low-level stuff and the high-level stuff.  Any
attempt to raise the abstraction there is a non-interesting, fruitless
exercise. 

The case for boot might be different though -- I've not spent enough
time there yet.

| It's a universal problem - if we wanted to bootstrap a machine from a cold, 
| memoryless, powerless state we would need some binary to feed it before it 
| could start speaking assembly. True bootstrapping is a very rare event ;-).  

I've been hacking real life compilers for over decade now :-)

[...]

| 1 and 3 are solved by always having a current notangle of configure.ac present 
| in the tree at all times.  As for two, I think we should assume a working 
| notangle is available.  We have to assume SOMETHING is working,

No question we have to assume something is workin -- just assume,
everybody knows that.

The issue is whether it must be noweb.  I think "no".  But, I do
understand your view.

I don't see why we need 'configure.ac'. Just 'configure' and
configure.ac.pamphlet should be enough. No? It is not so
different than the fact that we have both Makefile and
Makefile.pamphlet now in the current Axiom distribution. With
the new configure process this "bootstrap" just moves back
one step.

As I understand it configure.ac would only be necessary in
order to generate a new 'configure' file and this would
normally only be done by an ambitious developer *after* they
had successfully installed Axiom at least once.

Actually the 'noweave' command extracts the LaTeX file. 'notangle'
is required to extract configure.ac from configure.ac.pamphlet.
They are both parts of noweb which is either pre-installed or
optionally installed as one of the first steps in the axiom
build process.

The possibility of using some other literate programming tool
besides noweb is an interesting issue, but I think we should
agree that it is beyond the scope of the work.

I agree. As a user I would like to see just the usual:

  ./configure
  make
  make test
  make install
  axiom

What happens inside I don't care (unless it fails).

If ./configure says:

  noweb is missing. Please install noweb first or specify
  the option --with-noweb

I think most users of open source who are willing to build
from source would be able to handle that.

I think Axiom developers can live with just a little more
complication than that in order to handle the literate
programming methodology. So they need to have noweb installed.
This would certainly be the case anyway if they had already
built Axiom successfully. In that case they can use notangle
to extract a modified configure.ac from an edited version of
configure.ac.pamphlet before running automake/autoconf to
generate the new 'configure' and Makefile.in for a revised
distribution.

To be nice to new developers we might want to provide

  make distribution

to automate this process.

buildXXX.sh is not so common. I would prefer to see just the
following pre-extracted as read-only files in the root of the
distribution:

  README
  configure
  Makefile.in

with all others just .pamphlet files. The three files above
would also be contained as chunks in one of the .pamphlet
files - probably Makefile.pamphlet where all the other build
documentation is maintained. Because the Axiom build uses
recursive make on subdirectories, perhaps it would be convenient
if the Makefile.in files were present on each sub-directory
of the distribution. But as usual it is just the pamphlet
files that would be edited.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Autoconf needs an input to generate configure, that ought to be
configure.ac.  You can imagine that the configure.ac exists only for
the purpose of generating configure, but things are not that simple
when one uses to other tools that depend on configure.ac.

The windows build uses MSYS/MingGW so there is not much
difference from the usual linux build process. All of the
standard developer tools work in (almost) the same way.

The only complication here about Axiom on windows is that the
patches to the original axiom--main--1 linux distribution made
nearly two years ago by Mike Thomas to create axiom--windows--1
have not yet been merged back into the main sources. This is
not such a big deal - but somebody has to do it ... :)

A new release of Axiom on windows is long over due. Is anyone
interested in taking on the task? I am available to help but
not to lead the effort. And of course there is a chance that
we might be able to get Mike involved again. :)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi Ralf,

  I've tested you patches to fix build issues.  They are merged to the
silver branch as revision 78.  Many thanks.

  Now, I'll move in the configure stuff.

Do you have an up-to-date set of sources from which you can build the
windows image? Are they someplace I can get at them?

Up-to-date? No, only the originals in the arch axiom--windows--1
branch and the same sources in darcs - both dated about Tue,
15 Mar 2005. :(

You can get to either of these for windows (but using tla on
Windows is a bit awkward). For details see:

"How I Built Axiom on Windows" at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

The only things missing here are the list of gcc files that must
be included in order to compile SPAD code and how to use NSYS to
build the actualy binary distribution for windows. If anyone gets
that far, I can help fill in these gaps.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I was rather hoping for more than "a few pages" ... ;)

One thing to consider is that what is "real value" to one person
might not be so valuable to someone else (and vice versa). And
of course what is of value to you now changes over time as you
become more experienced.

Everytime this happens to you it might be a great benefit to
others if you could note this quickly some where on the web
site. I good place to do this might be on the FAQ page.

Here is my adapted version of the Wikipedia 'Be Bold' principle.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxBeBold

I hope people will take the time to practice being bold by
correcting and extending this statement. Then we could advertise
that is it also official our policy.

It is also possible to use emacs as an external page editor.
Perhaps some people would find this more convenient.

I think that is a good idea. In fact things have been slowly
evolving in this direction ever since Martin Rubey's first
efforts improve the organization of the Axiom Wiki web site.
Suggestions on what these "standard pages" should be would be
most welcome.

I am willing to add such a link to the edit page once we agree
on the draft in SandBoxBeBold.

Well, we don't have the ability to do it with just your mouse
but you can move pages in the structure using 'backlinks'. If
you click on the page name in the header you will see a list
of pages that link to this page and also a list of the pages to
which this page links. The main purpose of the backlinks page
is to allow you to specify the "parents" of the page. I recently
made some improvements to the backlinks page based on code
from a more recent version of ZWiki.

The list of parents for each page actually forms a "topic lattice"
or "ontology" which specifically relates the current page to
other pages in a "hierarchical" manner (not necessarily a tree
structure). This structure is shown in the left sidebar (except
on FrontPage).

The left side bar displays the topic lattice both above (UP)
and below (DOWN) the current page. In general, clicking on links
in the UP section leads to more general topics, while clicking
links in the DOWN section leads to more detailed topics.

Originally this page was intended as a very quick introduction

to Axiom itself.

Yes. Just click 'diff' on the top line.

The proposed SandBoxBeBold page deals with this issue.

Ok, but I would like a design that does not involve adding
too much more text to the edit-page. Maybe just another link
to some specific help page?

The MathAction web site (consisting of Axiom Wiki and Axiom
Portal) started out simply as an experiment to demonstrate how
Axiom could be interfaced to LatexWiki (an add-on module to
ZWiki). The idea was **first** to use LatexWiki as an interface
for Axiom and only *second* to see if we could use the wiki
as a way of collaborating on creating an Axiom users and
developer web site... but of course our ambitions grew over
time (without respect to available time :).

Yes, I think Doyen is still an important part of the overall
"vision" of where this is all going. And I think the DoyenCD
project is an important new tool that might well encourage
people to also participate on the Axiom Wiki by allowing them
to first experiment and practicing on the own computer by just
booting the DoyenCD (or virtual machine).

I have used <h1> and <h2> to structure the page. Since I consider that 
page like a (very short) paper, I would like to see the headlines appear 
either at the top of the page or on the left hand side (without typing 
more myself). We already know that Zwiki handles the first paragraph of 
the page as an abstract that is used also in other places like

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SiteIndex

Unfortunately, that "abstract" thing is not/was not know to many 
wiki-contributors. It should be more apparent how to structure a page.
One suggestion from me would be: If a new page is created, a 
StructuredText-Template with 2 or 3 sections and subsections is 
generated, so that one remembers, how to structure the page. If I look 
at wikipedia, they also don't just have random looking pages, but it 
looks they have somethink like a "corporate design" and that even with 
thousands of different people contributing.

Aha!!! Then it looks to me that this is ANOTHER repository that can even 
be freely distributed too. Actually, I think that is a great idea, but 
obviously, it is not really apparent that one might change Axiom. And it 
is also not clear, what the process is to make changes to that 
WikiRepository (Is this now a Bronze = testing repository? Or would that 
be too much confusion?). In fact, that repository should appear on the 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandboxAxiomSources site at the very 
bottom, right? Who is maintaining and testing contributions to it? 
Should we have a branch at SVN that is in sync with the Wiki-repository?

OK the name is clear now to me, but as I said, it should be explained 
somewhere, what happens with contributions and how they might make their 
way to silver and gold. I think it is important to make our development 
process clear to potential contributors. (OK, first, we should come up 
with one.)

Very ambitious! Doesn't that cost a lot of server power? And note, you 
expect the user to wait for at least half an hour before the compilation 
is finished. Who is going to wait that long?

I don't know exactly, what SCM you have behind axiom--test--1, but I 
guess, it is darcs. Would it be much of an effort to create a branch on 
the SVN archive and keep it in sync with axiom--test--1? Back and forth?
But I see a problem with modifications that break the building process. 
No? Is there currently some connection between the axiom that runs in 
the background of the wiki and axiom--test--1? If not then it would be 
easier to keep the sources in sync.

Nice. Could you add entries to SandboxAxiomSources. I think we should 
have just ONE page that describes all the different ways to access sources.

However http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MathActionRepository is 
read-only, so http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/FrontPage
is superior, since it allows contributions. We just have to make it obvious.

Aha, a lattice. I didn't know. That makes structuring a bit more 
difficult for me. And I think (at least currently) it is also difficult 
for someone who just wants to read something from top to bottom. So 
actually, though it is a lattice, I would like to have an option to 
present the innocent (new) reader a (selected by us) tree structure of 
the information. If this reader got the main ideas from such a 
structured linear text (basically like in a book), he is probably more 
interested in browsing through the whole lattice. But I would like to 
give newcomers a linear view of our information.

Some time ago, I started with thinking about a (handwritten) table of 
contents that tried to impose a structure. I did not come very far since 
I got lost myself in the lattice. And I don't know whether a handwritten 
TOC is good. Basically, it sounds like the LEO idea, but I don't see a 
tool on the wiki that easily lets me combine pages into a new structure. 
My mouse is currently completely useless for such things.

Is there actually someone who uses the page rating at the bottom right

Bill, I have clicked to that page. My first impression was: I am not 
going to read it. It's too much.

The first line is not OK for my taste. It will be shown in SiteIndex and 
what does it tell you? You don't learn what BeBold is from that. So the 
SiteIndex is useless.

There should be just one paragraph explaining in short, what BeBold 
means. It should be a teaser to read the rest of the page. 
Unfortunately, I don't have an idea now, but maybe I'll change that page 
tonight.

I am slowly learning... ;-)

Now I see: "Other parent:". Maybe that is clear for a native speaker, 
for me it is not. For example I see on 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxBeBold/backlinks
just the parent FAQ. So if I put something into "Other parent" will this 
remove the link to "FAQ". Writing "additional parent" would be more 
obvious to me.

Why cannot I add more children? Why not having something like

Parents of this page, i.e this page is a subtopic of

1. Blah
2. Foo
Add new parent: _______ [Browse Index]

----------------------

Children of this page, i.e this pages has the following subtopics:

1. Habl
2. Oof
3. Bar
Add new child: ________ [Browse Index]

------------------------------------------------------------

And maybe at the bottom of the page you write that the whole structure 
of the wiki forms a lattice.

Ralf --

   Based on the feedback I got, I implemented the Autoconf-based
configuration stuff as a pamphlet file (see below).  At the moment,
the only thing it does is to mimic the existing (old) configure file.
Future work aims at reducing the build process to

     ./configure
      make
      make install


   To test this, you don't need to run Autoconf.  Just check out a
fresh copy of the build-improvements branch and proceed as usual.

   Feedback appreciated.

Thanks!

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This is the top-level Autoconf file that sets up the minimum build
environment for Axiom.  At the moment, the mainline version
of Axiom is driven by \file{Makefile} pamphlet files.  This effort
strives to move the build machinery to more abstract description
and conventional ones.
The task is compounded by the fact that the Axiom system is very 
complex -- but much less complex, I suspect, than say GCC.  There does not
seem to be good reasons why Axiom should build its own ghetto.

Autoconf supports two kinds of comments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [[dnl]] style, and
\item [[#]] style.
\end{enumerate}
Comments introduced with [[dnl]] do not appear in the \file{configure}
output file.  Comments starting with [[#]] appear verbatim in the
\file{configure} generated file.  Because this source file is
literate, there almost never is a need to use the [[dnl]]-style
comment.  Consequently, Autoconf comments in this file should be
of [[#]]-style.  Such comments can be of value to the occasional
poor masochist who will be debugging the generated \file{configure}
file.

\section{Old Story}

The contents of top-level \file{configure} file from mainline is 
reproduced below.  It will serve as the initial basis for the new,
improved, build machinery.

\begin{verbatim}
# The sysname function uses uname -s to try to decode what kind of
# system to build. Currently the return value of uname is mapped as
#       Linux          --> linux
#       MINGW32_NT-5.1 --> windows
#       SunOS          --> Solaris9
#       Fedora Core 3  --> fedora3
#       freebsd        --> freebsd
#
# The solaris platform needs patch->gpatch, awk->gawk, tar->gtar
 
sysname () {
if [ -f /etc/redhat-release ] ;
 then 
  SYSNAME=`cat /etc/redhat-release` 
  if [ "$SYSNAME" = "Fedora Core release 3 (Heidelberg)" ] ; 
   then SYSNAME=fedora3
  fi
  echo SYSNAME=$SYSNAME
fi
if [ ! "$SYSNAME" = "fedora3" ] ; 
 then
   SYSNAME=`uname -s`
   echo $SYSNAME 
   if [ "$SYSNAME" = "Linux" ] ; then SYSNAME=linux
   elif  [ "$SYSNAME" = "MINGW32_NT-5.1" ] ; then SYSNAME=windows
   elif  [ "$SYSNAME" = "SunOS" ] ; then SYSNAME=solaris9
   elif  [ "$SYSNAME" = "freebsd" ] ; then SYSNAME=freebsd
   else
     echo Your system name is $SYSNAME
     echo We do not know how to build for this kind of system
     echo Send a note to axiom-developer@nongnu.org about it
     echo
     exit 0
   fi

\section{Basic Setup}
\subsection{Autoconf Initialization}

The Autoconf machinery needs to be initialized with several pieces of
information:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{name} of the system --- ``Axiom silver branch''
\item its \emph{version}.  I choose to use the date of last checkin.
  It should probably include the revision number so as to 
  unambiguously identify which Axiom flavour du jour is being
  built;
\item and where to send feedback, \emph{e.g.} bug reports.  I have chosen
  the \email{axiom-developer} list.  That could change in the future if
  we reach a high volume traffic.  For the moment, we don't seem to
  suffer from traffic...
\end{itemize}
<<Autoconf init>>=
AC_INIT([Axiom silver branch], [2006-07-15], [axiom-developer@nongnu.org])
@

Autoconf needs some auxilary files that are present in the sub-directory
\file{config}.  Autoconf needs to be told about that.
<<auxiliary config files>>=
AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(config)
@

Notice that since we don't use Automake (yet), we don't initialize
the Automake subsystem.  
<<Automake init>>=
# AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign])
@

We require Autoconf 2.59 or higher from the developer part. Please,
note that this is no requirement on the user build environment.  All,
it means is that if someone makes changes to the current \file{configure.ac}
file, that someone needs to have Autoconf 2.59 or higher to process this
file in order to regenerate \file{configure}.
<<Autoconf prerequirement>>=
AC_PREREQ([2.59])
@


\subsection{Source tree sanity check}

The Autoconf system implements a very basic, simple-minded, sanity check
whereby it will refuse to run \file{configure} if the source tree does
not contain a specified file, that serves a witness for a bona fide source
tree.  Here, I have chosen \file{Makefile.pamphlet} from the \file{src}
subdirectory.
<<sanity check>>=
AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR(src/Makefile.pamphlet)
@


\subsection{Build Environment}

Standard build environments consist of
\begin{enumerate}
\item the \emph{host} platform,
\item the \emph{build} platform, and
\item the \emph{target} platform.
\end{enumerate}
FIXME: Example on these notions.

We need to get the canonical names for the above three platforms.
After call to this macro, those values are available in the variables
[[host]], [[build]], and [[target]], respectively.
<<host build target platfoms>>=
AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
@

For the moment, Axiom supports neither cross-compilation, nor Canadian cross.
Consequently, we must bail out if the build is not native.
<<check cross-compilation>>=
if test $host != $build -o $host != $target; then
   AC_MSG_ERROR([Sorry, only native builds are currently supported])
fi
@

Most of the tools we're testing for are with respect to the build
environment, neither the host nor the target.  

First of all, check for a C compiler --- \textsl{GCC/gcc} preferably.  As
written, this test is OK because currently we support only native
builds.  However, it needs to be more carefully written when we move
to cross-compilation.
<<check for C compiler>>=
AC_PROG_CC
@

Then, check for a usable 'install' program.
<<check for install>>=
AC_PROG_INSTALL
@

The old build machinery needs 'awk'.  Currently, it checks for
'gawk', 'nawk', and 'awk'.  Autoconf has a predefined test for that
task.  It checks for 'gawk', 'mawk', 'nawk', and 'awk' in that order.
That should be OK and match Axiom's need.

The old build system claims that on solaris9, gawk, gtar 
and gpatch are required (with no much explanation of why).  Notice
that these programs are needed only to build Axiom; so we do
check based on the value of [[build]].
<<check for awk tar patch>>=
case ${build} in
     *-solaris9)
        AC_CHECK_PROG([AWK], [gawk], 
                      [gawk], [AC_MSG_ERROR([Axiom needs gawk])])

        AC_CHECK_PROG([TAR], [gtar], 
                      [gtar], [AC_MSG_ERROR([Axiom needs gtar])])

        AC_CHECK_PROG([PATCH], [gpatch],
                      [gptach], [AC_MSG_ERROR([Axiom needs gpatch])]) 
        ;;

      *)
        AC_PROG_AWK

        AC_CHECK_PROGS([TAR], [gtar tar], 
                       [AC_MSG_ERROR([Axiom needs a tar program])])

        AC_CHECK_PROGS([PATCH], [gpatch patch], 
                       [AC_MSG_ERROR([Axiom needs a patch program])])
        ;;
esac
@


Once we have found those values, we must substitute them in the
Makefiles.  For the moment, these actions are effectless as the
current makefile are hand-written and Autoconf-unaware.
<<substitute AWK TAR PATCH>>=
AC_SUBST(AWK)
AC_SUBST(TAR)
AC_SUBST(PATCH)
@

Obviously we need the 'make' program.  No build will proceed without
it.
<<check for make>>=
AC_CHECK_PROG([MAKE], [make],
              [make], [AC_MSG_ERROR([`make' program missing.])])
@

Here, we replicate the behaviour of the old configure, waiting for
a better alternative, e.g. where it is not needed.  THIS WILL BE
REMOVED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

First, the old machinery has a very coarse target name "discovery"
<<replicate old behaviour>>=
if test -f /etc/redhat-release; then 
   SYSNAME=`cat /etc/redhat-release` 
   if test "$SYSNAME" = "Fedora Core release 3 (Heidelberg)"; then

   esac

There are several wiki modes for Emacs (see 
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/WikiModeDiscussion). I tried one 
of them several month ago, but it didn't quite work then. Maybe the 
necessary server support isn't enabled yet.

Looks not too bad to me, but Bill made sections with headlines. So you 
are trying to remove the headlines. OK I can live with that.

I like the first section above, but Screenshots/video is a bit too long 
as a name. Also "Online try"? Why in the next section? What has that to 
do with Download?

Screenshot/video/online try all belong into one category I think. That 
is for getting a feeling of what axiom can do. From the About page there 
should certainly be a link to these pages. So I would rather suggest

...
FAQ
------------
Screenshots
Video
Online Try
-----------
Download
-----------

I don't know what you mean with Developer. Should that link to 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxActiveAxiomDevelopers/withNavigator

I don't think that Bibliography is the best word. Would you immediately 
think that you can find actual downloadable papers behind it? Is there 
some native speaker who can come up with something better?

Ralf

Many websites just say "Papers".  That is short; that is good.

You know, your link costs me several hours just to find out what to do.

I expected that I convince my browser to fire up emacs when I press the 
edit button on the AxiomWiki page. But from the few lines I read on your 
suggested link it looks different. Cannot you just give a paragraph 
explaining how it should work. So that I would know whether I still want 
to invest time into installing something. And a "installing for dummies" 
algorithm would be very much appreciated. Also my time is limited.

Thank you

Ralf

Hi Gaby,

your working times are remarkable. Aren't you in Texas? ;-)

I have seen that there are now also ChangeLog files under axiom/src/doc 
and axiom/src/boot. Is it common to have *not* just one top-level 
ChangeLog? Now I am getting confused of where I should enter my 
changelog stuff.

Ralf

Axiom Developers,

I am sorry but while I slept I see that the link spammers
finally managed to break through. :( I guess my attempts
over the last few days must have really irritated them...

To stop this attack I had to temporarily disable sendmail
from axiom-developer.org. Delete the mail queue. Then I
modified the spam filter to disallow all comments and edits
containing external links. And restarted sendmail. Now
things are back to normal, I think.

Disabling external links means that http:// is no longer allowed
in any comment. Links that are internal to the Axiom Wiki are
still ok and can be written in the form:

  "link name":/xxx/yyy

or as standard wiki names.

I hope that is enough to hold them off for now.

If it continues we could at least disable the notices from
the Axiom Wiki and this would prevent the email part of the
spam (but not the pollution of the web site). Or we may be
forced (as a last resort) to only permit comments and edits
by registered users which would of course defeat the main
purpose of the wiki.

Who ever did this seems to know what they are doing since it
appears as if they have successfully spoofed a large number
of different ip addresses in a kind of "deny of service"
attack.

Here is a list of the ip addresses used by whoever caused
the most recent spam attack on Axiom Wiki.

I don't see any immediate pattern in this list, so for now
I must assume that these are bogus ip addresses. If they
were real, we would have grounds to contact the people and
companies to which these addresses are assigned.

If anyone sees a pattern to this list of ip addresses
please let me know.

I apologize for the email pain.

Bill Page.

I think, Bill's suggestion is the right one. We have a pure ./configure
file that is distributed with the Axiom sources and a configure.ac.pamphlet.

We have two ways to compile Axiom:

1) For ordinary users who want to download and compile and run axiom

>      ./configure
>       make
>       make install
         axiom

should be enough.

2) For developers who want to compile Axiom change it and test their 
stuff. (Same commands as above.)

3) For developers who want to work on the build process and need to 
change configure.ac.pamphlet. Here

	./configure
	make configure
	autoconf configure.ac > configure
	./configure
	make
	make install

should do the compilation. The first configure (that comes with Axiom) 
checks for noweb and generates a simple Makefile that enables a
"make configure". "make configure" could then call notangle to generate 
configure.ac (It could even include "autoconf configure.ac > 
configure".) Would that be a bad bootstrapping?

Gaby, it is only you who must run

notangle configure.ac.pamphlet > configure.ac
autoconf configure.ac > configure

ONCE and then we see a "configure" file in the distribution of Axiom.

I have made some of the improvements in 'backlinks' that
you suggested below.

On Wednesday, August 02, 2006 5:00 AM you wrote:

Now the text field is 'Add new parent' and the button is
'Add/remove parents'. Is that better?

Children are defined as the inverse of the Parent relation.
Each page has an (internal) list of it's parents and children
(subtopics) are added only implicitly. Adding new children
to a page could be done but it would involve some new Python
coding.

Done.

I believe both ways of doing things are common; I have a slight

both ways.  That way I don't have long file names eating up all space
just to give me little clues.

For the Silver branch, you will find a ChangeLog file in each
directory (almost).  Juts put your descriptions there.

For the branches, it is actually more practical to have a different
ChangeLog files -- the convention I use is ChangeLog.<branch-name>.
There are several paratical reasons for that:
  (1) avoid spurious conflicts when merging;
  (2) a glance at the file gives an overview of changes made on
      the branch.


Ah; I've just finished the "./configure && make && make install" stuff.
I'll commit after testing.

This is not the use of emacs that I referred to in my previous
email (although these wiki modes do seem interesting in their own
right). The concept of an External Editor is a ZWiki/Zope idea.
You can read about it here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/ExternalEdit

Marten Rubey used to use this mode of editing wiki pages extensively.
Perhaps he can give a more "user-oriented" description of how this
works.

I forgot to mention that the icon that starts an external edit
session is the little "pencil" in the top right hand side of the
screen on the extreme right side of the menu line on Axiom Wiki.
But you must first configure your system as described at the
above link.

This is possible using a page type of reStructuredText. See

http://zwiki.org/RestructuredText

Axiom Wiki supports this page type but not yet with embedded Axiom
commands. To set the page type select the type in the top right
side of the edit or create new form.

I am not sure of you will be happy to learn yet another "language"
for writing web pages, however there are some people who strongly
prefer reStructuredText over StructuredText because it is apparently
both more powerful and more regular.

I tried converting your original StructuredText page to
reStructuredText here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxAxiomSourcesReST

I am still having some trouble with the @ character. I will look\
into this problem later today.

Regards,
Bill Page.

| 
| I think, Bill's suggestion is the right one. We have a pure ./configure
| file that is distributed with the Axiom sources and a configure.ac.pamphlet.

from the outset, the project aimed at shipping ./configure.  However,
that file must be generated from somewhere.  For Autoconf, that must
be something like configure.ac.
The debate was whether configure.ac is sufficient by itself as
literate or whether it must come from a pamphlet file.
My opinion is that it is sufficient.  Others disagree.  So, I
implemented the solution others suggested -- even though I disagree
with it.

| We have two ways to compile Axiom:
| 
| 1) For ordinary users who want to download and compile and run axiom
| 
| >      ./configure
| >       make
| >       make install
|          axiom
| 
| should be enough.
| 
| 2) For developers who want to compile Axiom change it and test their
| stuff. (Same commands as above.)
| 
| 3) For developers who want to work on the build process and need to
| change configure.ac.pamphlet. Here
| 
| 	./configure
| 	make configure

That is too circular and too complicated. It is a good recipe for subtle
bugs.  We don't want to be too clever at that level.

| 	autoconf configure.ac > configure
| 	./configure
| 	make
| 	make install

Currently, here is the sequence I propose -- and I'm using right now

    (1) modify configure.ac.pamphlet
    (2) run ./build-setup.sh            -- you don't need to know what
                                        -- it does, except it does the
                                        -- right thing for you
    (3) ./configure && make && make install

| 
| should do the compilation. The first configure (that comes with Axiom)
| checks for noweb and generates a simple Makefile that enables a
| "make configure". "make configure" could then call notangle to
| generate configure.ac (It could even include "autoconf configure.ac >
| configure".) Would that be a bad bootstrapping?
| 
| Gaby, it is only you who must run
| 
| notangle configure.ac.pamphlet > configure.ac
| autoconf configure.ac > configure

I do expect other developers making changes to
configure.ac.pamphlet (and later to any Makefile.am.pamphlet) to run
equivalent commands.  Fortunately, that is all taken care of by
build-setup.sh.  :-)

build-setup.sh is not an end-user stuff.  It is only for maintainers
of the build machinery.

End users just follow the scenario at 1)

Mainitainers are required to have noweb installed -- so I proceeded to
install noweb myself.


Bill suggested we don't keep configure.ac.  I fear we must kepp it --
for the purpose of preventing the build machinery maintainers from
introducing subtle bugs.  Components of Autotools have dependency on
such files in several circumstances.

Thank you very much for fighting spam for us.

I like to point how important it is not only because it is annoying but also
because it will make the axiom web page a so called "farm link" meaning
loosing rating or not even showing up in Google and co.

We have discussed alternatives to noweb before, including writing our own Lisp 
version of noweb.  I expect eventually we will be able to move off of noweb, 
but right now it's easier to use what works.

Oh, no question I agree that depending specifically on noweb is unfortunate.

I think the way out is clear - put all of the low level logic in Lisp, and the 
high level logic in Aldor (or SPAD, until Aldor is available).  Tim has begun 
that process with bookvol5 - once all of interp is in human readable lisp, 
both the boot files in interp and the boot directory itself should become 
unnecessary.  It should also enable a lot of other interesting activities 
with existing Lisp tools, but that's a side benefit.

Sorry, didn't mean to lecture the experts ;-).  I just find it a really 
interesting problem - the answer to "how do we go from cold, dumb, inert 
lumps of metal and silicon to a running computer"  is a lot less trivial than 
one might think - the technological Dr. Frankenstein, so to speak ;-)

I doubt it has to be noweb - my preference would be for a lisp based tool, but 
I can see arguments for bash, sed, perl, and other such tools.  (Particularly 
since a lisp distribution is a poor assumption to make on most computers in 
the world today :-( .)  Really, we should have a "rosetta" set of tools to 
translate pamphlets to buildable files (e.g. the notangle step)  in as wide a 
variety of tools as possible, since that step is so critical and needs 
something working to bootstrap it.  I expect getting the source code of of a 
pamphlet is probably simpler as a dedicated operation than all of noweb 
(particularly with a universal, standard nomenclature denoting source code) - 
maybe a collection of such scripts could replace the current content of the 
boot directory once we don't need boot ;-).  ('course, I should try writing 
one before I conclude it's doable...)  Then we could reduce the "something 
working" requirement from noweb to "one of noweb, Lisp, perl, sed, bash, csh, 
etc. etc. etc."

In a sense, one might also say that depending on LaTeX is a bit unfortunate to 
produce human readable documentation, because a TeX installation is not 
especially trivial (nor is it common on Windows).  However, the highly 
nontrivial nature of LaTeX and TeX makes that a much more difficult problem, 
and I don't think we have a choice but to assume a working TeX installation 
for the time being.  cl-typesetting might eventually evolve into a viable 
alternative we could build and run off of the same technology used to build 
and run Axiom itself, but it's nowhere near ready yet.  And we can't afford 
the space bundling something like teTeX and MiKTeX (or even a subset of them) 
would take.

Anyway.  Interesting to think about, and maybe even practical, but that's for 
later.  Right now, THANK YOU Gabriel for making a configure/make/make install 
routine for Axiom!!!

Cheers,
CY

That doesn't look too bad to my eyes, but it seems that reStructuredText 
is not able to handle identically named subsections.

System Message: INFO/1 (<string>, line 73); backlink
Duplicate implicit target name: "gnu arch".

And again a problem. I pressed the edit button to see what you have 
done, then I pressed "Preview" and I was asked to give a reason. 
Annoying, but if it must be to prevent spam I could live with it. But 
after I entered a reason, the password window popped up.... I quit. :-(
I just wanted a preview and the sources of the page on the same page.

Those are two way to use Axiom. And by putting it above download we make

Yes  just "Screenshot" will be better, as people do not epected video and
even are not looking for one.
And when people click on it the video should be at the top because it the
contexte "visual representation" it is relevant.

Developer where you will click if you are a developer or want to be one.
Here we find all the informations about our various SCM the distinction
between gold siliver. The developement road map, the forks projects, the
coding sugestion/bounty.
Arguments about design issue and so on.

What about a "Research" instead.
People will expected to find publications and so on there.

It isn't difficult at all.

Go to http://www.zope.org/Members/Caseman/ExternalEditor.

Mac Users: Download the ZopeEditManager, put it into your Application 
Folder, start it, change the Preferences to reflect your choice of 
editor and set ZopeEditManager as the MIME handler for 
application/x-zope-edit in your browser.


Unix Users:

     Download zopeedit-src.tgz and extract it. Enter the zopeedit
     directory and run (You may need to be root)::

       python2.2 setup.py install

     This will install the zopeedit.py executable (in /usr/local/bin on 
my
     system). Alternately, you can just copy zopeedit.py to the location 
of
     your choosing.

     Once you have the helper application installed, you need to 
configure your
     browser to fire it off appropriately. To do so, create an entry in 
the
     helper applications list for your browser(s) that associates the 
mime type
     "application/x-zope-edit" with the helper application.

	Step by step instructions for Mozilla and Konqueror are in the README.


   Tips

     The helper application can run any editor program that does not 
detach
     itself from the controlling process.

     To get terminal based editors to work, you need to spawn them 
inside an
     xterm. to do this, use something like the following for the editor 
option::

       editor = xterm -e vi

     You can of course modify the above to fire up your favorite 
terminal and
     editor or add any command line arguments you want.

     As for editors that insist on detaching from the controlling 
process (gvim
     does this by default), you need to configure them so that they do 
not
     detach. For gvim you could use::

       editor = gvim -f


DO NOT FORGET TO WRITE SOMETHING IN THE 'Log: '-LINE, OTHERWISE THE 
CHANGES WON'T BE ACCEPTED.

Hope that helps,
Kai

First of all let me say that I have no idea how all this 
autoconf/automake works... So I expect to learn something through this 
thread.

I don't see a difference between

 >     (1) modify configure.ac.pamphlet
 >     (2) run ./build-setup.sh

and my suggested

	modify configure.ac.pamphlet
	make configure

In my previous mail I suggested "./configure && make configure" but that 
was only to make sure that "noweb" is found by "configure" if you have 
it installed somewhere, then of course you don't need to run 'configure'.

Now whether you call "build-setup.sh" or "make configure" isn't much of 
a difference. Is it? It is responsible for creating configure.ac from 
configure.ac.pamphlet.

I know that "make" checks whether the "Makefile" is as new as it could 
be. But does it check whether there is Makefile.in or Makefile.am and 
re-generates the Makefile from that???

And why do you insist on having all Makefiles generated during 
"configure"? For me it is perfectly fine if the Makefiles are 
regenerated from their .pamphlets during the build of Axiom. It is only 
that the Makefiles should more rely on variables that define programs 
like using ${TAR} instead of just tar.

Or is the whole thing more complicated than I think?

So each time I modify a file which is called configure.ac.pamphlet or 
Makefile.am.pamphlet, I should run "build-setup.sh". What if I forget 
that? There should be at least a warning telling me that I should run 
"build-setup.sh".

That's clear.

Can you make up an example so that we see what problems can occur and 
appreciate why we should keep configure.ac. Then that should be 
documented (in a pamphlet file) describing the build process.
Currently, I also don't feel need for configure.ac, given that 
maintainers have noweb and configure.ac.pamphlet.

Ralf

Who feels responsible for writing that page? It's a must for us...

And what I like even more ... "AxiomRoadMap", long term and short term 
goals. Currently everyone does something, but it's not at all clear to 
others what we are actually doing.

Maybe the page http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TodoList could be reused?

Thank you Bill.

Yes, but where is the "Browse" botton? Otherwise I must figure out the 
names through a second window that contains "SiteMap". Cannot I have 
"SiteMap" in a frame on the right hand side of a backlinks page? Then I 
could use cut&paste to add a parent.

One remark still. You wrote

Add new parent: ______ [Add/remove parents]

That is confusing. And in the text below you still refer to the 
"Reparent" button. Just remove the first "Add new parent".

OK, would be a "nice to have" feature, but don't invest time on it now.

But why would I like to order the subtopics? I cannot map that to the 
"lattice" notion.

"make" means that there is a Makefile that is used to make "configure".
There isn't.  Any makefile must be generated at configure time when
building Axiom.  I know that is not what the current system does;
but it is a bug -- it got me several times.

from my perspective; there is.  See above.

[...]

No.  Makefile.in usually contains variables that need to be
substituted.  Makefile.am is even at higher level.  You need
Automake.  Now, when you have the full Autotools in place, if you
modify Makefile.am or configure.ac and you say "make", there usually
is a dectection and autoconf is run to regenerate

| And why do you insist on having all Makefiles generated during
| "configure"? 

Because they contain platform-specific information and the standard way to
reduce duplication and make the whole system manageable is to abstract
over the variabilities.  Otherwise, we have the current mess. 
This isn't an innovation.  Look at any other system that uses Autoconf
+ Automake (Maxima is one that additionally has a Lisp-based configure).

In part yes.

The only benefit I see of not storing configure.ac is more
complications and more potential for bugs.  I don't see the benefits.

| 
| So each time I modify a file which is called configure.ac.pamphlet or
| Makefile.am.pamphlet, I should run "build-setup.sh".

Yes.

| What if I forget that? 

I'll catch you.  Your "make configure" suffers from the same problem.

When we move to Automake, the system will assist me.

| There should be at least a warning telling me that I should run
| "build-setup.sh".

Probably; that is low-priority right now.

| 
| Can you make up an example so that we see what problems can occur and

No, I don't have time for that -- I'm sorry.  You have to take my word
for it for the moment.  When I get more time, I can play with testcases.

Yes.  That is not an issue.

Then just forget about it and run build-setup.sh.

Unfortunately, I don't have an infinite amount of time to wait.  The

when I eventually succeed in convincing some linux distros to have

Yes you are right, this could happen if we let too much spam
accumulate.=09

The spam attach is still continuing at the rate of more than 60
attempts per minute. Uncaught spam arriving at this rate could
easily overwhelm our server and cause it to fail.

My first attempt at a remedy for this problem was to configure
the wiki to require user preferences to be set before permitting
comments and then left the ban on http external links. This works
but unfortunately the spam robots are smarter than I thought and
actually do set the cookies necessary to indicate valid preferences.
So when I tried it a few hours ago, we got another burst of spam
that got through and ultimately (partly my fault) it resulted in
having to reboot the axiom-developer.org server.

My second attempt to control this threat is to continue the ban
on http external links for unauthenticated (i.e. non Zope) users.
This is the way the ban was originally supposed to work - users
who have a specially assigned user id - over and above that set
in their preferences - are allowed to ignore the ban. If they
are editing a page or adding a comment that contains banned
content, then they will be prompted to enter their user id and
password. If it is valid, the edit will be allowed to continue.
If not, then they (and all those damned robots!) will receive
a 401 Unauthorized return code.

This seems to be working now. Would those of you who have the
Zope user accounts, i.e. Ralf, Marten, and Bob McElrath, please
try this and confirm that it is working the way it is supposed
to.

It might be possible to lift the ban on external links at some
point in the future if these spam attacks stop, but in the
mean time, if you are an Axiom developer or Axiom user and you
want to be able to freely edit and post comments to the Axiom
Wiki, please contact me by email and I will provide you with a
Zope user id. If you would like just to make one or two simple
pages and you get caught by this ban, maybe the best approach
would be for you to send your changes to one someone who already
has a Zope user id.

Bill Page.

Since wiki spam must occur over a HTTP connection, it is 2-way.  So, you
have the verified IP's of the attackers.  Someone is clearly using a
zombie net.  Consider spawning:
     iptables -A INPUT -s "$IP" -j DROP
when someone posts something in the banned_links.  Then, one would want
to remove the ban on reguar links or you would hit legitimate users.
I'm assuming banned_links would contain only the bad URL's/domain names.
So in each case you would get at least one spam.  

I don't think it's possible or practical to try to ban spam *before*
seeing spam from a given source.  They can always find a way around any
system you set up.

That's an interesting idea...can the post be held for moderation too, in
case someone makes an interesting edit but doesn't have a zope userid?

This is one of the major drawbacks to ZWiki -- there is no way for the
user to create and manage his account.  Plone, for instance, allows the
user to create an account and login with a password.  User rights can be
managed from there.  (if anyone wants to consider dumping the zwiki
portal in favor of putting everything in plone...)  There are lots of
zope user management products:
    http://www.zope.org/Products/user_management
but it would require some coding to get it to interface with zwiki.

Are you suggesting that I drop all connections from the
complete list of ip addresses that are being used by the
spammers? So far there are about 200 of these addresses
scattered over several different subnets so I am not sure
that this is practical. And as far as I can tell the number
of ip addresses they are using is growing. I could also
do something similar using our Apache hosts.deny file but
I am quite concerned that these are spoofed ip addresses
and do not really uniquely identify the spammers. Blocking
all of these addresses might well affect ligitimit users.

No, this does seem practical either because there are
literally hundreds of these domain names. What I did
instead was to ban all use of the http: prefix thus
eliminating the possibility of directly specifying an
external link in any form. (ZWikiRemote links are still
possible for predefined urls.)

Yes. If they got real mean, they could even start posting
random stuff with no embedded links just to bypass the ban
and overrun or server... but I am counting on them going to
all this trouble for a real purpose (i.e. link jamming) and
not just to annoy us - at least not for long.

Hmmm, you mean maybe write it to a non-web accessible or otherwise
protected log file somewhere? Maybe even to a set of "shadow" pages
that are only readable by registered Zope users? Moderation is a
neat idea but it would take some programming work to implement.

I agree that Plone has a smooth and reliable user management
system. It is certainly possible to move the Axiom Wiki over to
Plone and can even be done in a fairly nice and transparent way
by using switchable skins so that you can chose between seeing
the pages in conventional ZWiki style or as embeded in a Plone
portal wrapper. Simon set up something like that for the Ubuntu
wiki at one time, I think. I don't know if they are still using
it or not. Is anyone interested in experimenting with this on the
test.axiom-developer.org server? I did an initial setup like this
6 months ago and it seems to work. I recall that I had a few
issues trying to get authentication to work properly with the skin
switching. But I did not go as far as actually moving the content
of the wiki over a wiki hosted inside my test version of Plone.

>=20

I might look at these if it turns out we need a non-Plone longer
term solution.

Bill Page.

Only legitimate users that are using a hacked windows box.  And, good

Yep.  Why is that a problem?

Well, ideally something like a mailing list moderation where some
administrator can look at it and just hit a button to allow the edit.

If this is really being done via zombie net then I guess we
should be happy that is was only a couple hundred, right?
Maybe you are right that this is not such a problem, but
I would feel bad denying people access just because they are
being exploited without being able to give any explanation
even though the chance that any one of these users might
really want to know about Axiom is probably not that high.

The problem as I see it is that using this method we actually
have to let the spam through initially in order to capture
the domain names. And we don't have any easy way to harvest
the banned links from the spam postings and update the
pattern list. So it's an ongoing manual process. Plus I am
not sure how large this list can be practically speaking
since this is processed by Python as a large set of regular
expressions.

Maybe there are some new anti-spam options that Simon has
invented for ZWiki that could help, but merging our modified
ZWiki/LatexWiki code with the new ZWiki code is also likely
to be a serious amount of work. So far I have only done that
on a piecemeal basis.

That is your point of view and years of experience. I will trust you in 
setting up Autotools support for Axiom, since for now that is more 
important then sticking to pamphlet style. That you are going to 
document everything in some form is clear to me.

But still. I assumed that we distribute the sources with configure and 
an initial Makefile. That would be generated first by you via

   notangle configure.ac.pamphlet > configure.ac
   autoconf configure.ac > configure
   ./configure
   svn commit configure
   svn commit Makefile

That Makefile would contain code to generate "configure". So it 
basically contains your "build-setup.sh" script.

If I am an ordinary user, I start with ./configure && make.
If I am more advanced and change some stuff in configure.ac.pamphlet,
I start with "./configure" to make sure that I have "noweb" and then 
re-iterate via "make configure && ./configure". I really cannot see a 
problem with that.

But I never modify Makefile.am or configure.ac. Only the corresponding 
pamphlet files. So there clearly there is a target like

%: %.pamphlet
	notangle $< > $@

or something the like.

Well, isn't it much simpler? We are speaking here about the generation 
of code, so we mean notangle.

If for the bootstrapping file configure.ac.pamplet (that should be 
enough?) we restrict to just several code chunks of the form

<<*>>=
code here
@
...
<<*>>=
other code
@

All these <<*>> chunks are linearly concatenated by notangle to give the 
final output. For that simple task, I am sure that it is not too 
difficult to write a sed or awk script. And the initial dependency on 
noweb would be gone. Any sed/awk-programmers out there? Ehm, but then it 
might depend on awk... what programs are usually assumed to exist before 
I run ./configure? Windows/Un*x-like/MacOS systems are quite differnt.

I am not sure whether also the Makefile.am.pamphlet files could/should 
be written in such a linear way. But all the non-pamphlet world can 
handle just Makefile.am and that is linear. So where would a pamphlet 
format impose some dependency on noweb for the configure process?

That is right.  But Autotools have implicit dependency on those.

| Well, isn't it much simpler? We are speaking here about the generation
| of code, so we mean notangle.

We're speaking of the bootstrapping process.  We need to start
from somewhere.  I believe notangle is not a wrong starting point.

But as I said, I implemented the majority's view.  I just disagree
with it.  My disagreement does nto change what end user will have to
type to install Axiom, when the project is completed.

| <<*>>=
| other code
| @
| 
| All these <<*>> chunks are linearly concatenated by notangle to give

Yes, that is what I implemented in configure.ac.pamphlet.

| For that simple task, I am sure that it is not too
| difficult to write a sed or awk script. 

If you have that script, I'll drop my objection -- because it means
our bootstrapping dependency is much weaker, i.e. only traditional
tools.

Exactly.

| Any sed/awk-programmers out there? Ehm, but then it might depend on
| awk...

Awk is traditional enough.

| before I run ./configure?

That is the next round of patches I'll send.  Currently, there are
lots of unspoken dependencies deeply hidden in the makefiles.

| Windows/Un*x-like/MacOS systems are quite differnt.

Oh yeah, but I don't worry too much for the MacOS system as the
Unix-like enough.

Makefile.am does not need to be linear.  In fact, Makefile.am is
sufficiently high-level enough that if and when we get there, we will
see that Tim already did the job.  We just need to re-structure
Makefile.pamphlet first.  You won't have to write Makefile.am,
because you will write Makefile.pamphlet (should they be renamed to 
Makefile.am.pamphlet? I don't know).  Then you get Makefile.am out of
it by build-setup.sh.  Once the system is in place, I do expect very
little modifications of makefiles; I suspect that 95% contribution
will be about algebra codes, 2% about the compiler...  So, the current
project is not a big deal.

It has to be done sooner or later though, if you continue to use Zwiki, 
otherwise you fork more and more and you don't get the benefit of the 
latest enhancements. I know you know this. I think the best approach is for 
you and I to work on this together on IRC. I know Zwiki and you know the 
latexwiki/mathaction changes and together we could probably get over this 
hump in an hour or three.

Regarding the anti-spam features - these are documented best at 
http://zwiki.org/LinkSpam . I'm not sure which of them are available in 
your version at this point. Personally I don't bother with banned_links at 
all, updating it is too labour-intensive. max_anonymous_links and 
max_identified_links are quite effective although not perfect.

Each of these tends to raise the annoyance level for legitimate users even 
while it protects them. For your site, I have the feeling it may be best to 
bite the bullet and require a login for all or most kinds of edit. Signing 
up is annoying, but once you've done that, there should be no further 
hindrance to editing. And registering for a login (approved by human, if 
necessary) still seems to be a sufficient barrier to keep out spammers.

As for how to implement this: there are zope products which allow 
self-registration without the need for CMF or Plone (exUserFolder is an old 
one, there must be something better by now). Or, you could put the wiki 
inside Plone to take advantage of its polished membership system, but still 
have it use the fast zwiki skin (easy; see how-tos at zwiki.org or ask me).

Best,
-Simon

I think this is unwise.  I chased ZWiki "improvements" for more than a
year.  Maintaining a forked codebase that is up-to-date with the main
one is a full-time job.  Unfortunately, for dynamic web sites such as on
zope, EVERY site is essentially a forked codebase.  Mathaction
especially so due to LatexWiki, axiom, reduce, and the other enhancments
Bill has added.  Only the most trivial clone of zwiki.org could ever
hope to maintain an up-to-date copy of the zwiki code.

I do not think ZWiki will gain vast quantities of features that will be
critical for mathaction anytime soon.  This is the Microsoft/Intel
marketing ploy...don't buy (build) what you need, buy what will let you
run nebulous nonexistant things that we promise tomorrow.  I have a
different idea.  Use what works, NOW.

It is better to keep mathaction working, and add needed things
piecemeal.  It will be more work to merge mathaction with the latest
ZWiki than to import only the latest anti-spam features.

Hi Bill,

thank you for all your changes.

I just want to say that I like the *red* "Be Bold!" link in the "Add 
Comments" section at the end of each page. I like it even if I think 
that commenting on the page is not too helpful. People should really 
edit the page if they don't like something there.

Comments on a page look to me always like "the page should be improved, 
but nobody had time to do it". So it basically shows that Axiom (or at 
least the Axiom Wiki content) is not maintained well enough.

Ralf

Last night I saw that Automake depends on Perl. I am much more fluent in 
Perl. And Perl runs und Window, too. I believe a simple notangle 
replacement for the configure files would be much easier in Perl. Do you 
allow me to write it in Perl? Or is that dependency already too strong?

I guess the literate idea even says that it does not matter how a file 
is called. It is most important that you write a paper from which you 
can generate all the code (even different files from one pamphlet 
source). That sounds nice, but in some sense I find that very difficult 
to maintain. For ALLPROSE I set the convention every file is a .nw file. 
(I don't yet had the need to store file types like .fig or .png or other 
strange formats where the noweb-style makes no sense.)
The file keeps its original name with just .nw added. From that I 
generate .nw.tex files (that basically makes just one Makefile rule to 
generate latex). That naming convention has some advantages.

1) If you generate .dvi from the .nw.tex file. It is easily possible to 
click into the dvi file and jump to the .nw (not .nw.tex) source. VERY 
convenient.

2) At least for .as.nw file... If the compilation breaks and the Aldor 
compiler were able to understand the "#line ..." directives correctly, 
then one could use a smart editor (e.g emacs) to run the compilation 
inside a buffer and jump directly to the place in the source where the 
compiler found the error.

I suggest to adopt that convention for axiom (replace .nw by .pamphlet).

Ralf

Ralf,

In fact the system direction is the exact opposite, at least the parts
I touch. C (and, even more egregious, Java) adopt the file-per-function
kinds of idea.

If you look back in history (or lived it as I have), you'll see that the
tiny-file idea is based on computer restrictions. Memory was small and
the compiler couldn't handle large files. Furthermore, the loader couldn't
load large files. So everyone uses small files (or, in my case, short
paper tapes).

You see this legacy everywhere. It is still possible to write memory
overlays in linkers so that when one function completes it can be 
relaced in memory by another link section. This allows a large program
to run in small physical memory. This "feature" is still supported by
the intel chip with segmented memory (which is rarely used but still
causes pain). Limits of storage, compiler technology and imagination 
caused the idea of splitting out header files as a way to expose
signatures. Now we live in header-file hell. "Libraries" were ways
to collect all the little pieces so the linker could connect them
and now we have DLL hell and lib* hell. Indeed we are forced to use
"IDE"s because the tiny files have overwhelmed our ability to cope.

The #line directive is a hack to allow a runtime to figure out which
grain-of-sand-file contains this particular function. It is also a
legacy of history. I am building a program for work that lives in one
literate file, has 30,000 lines of Lisp code, and has 2000+ pages of
final pdf documentation (so far) and 7000 test cases. It is never
ambiguous which file contains the failing function.




Computer programs have nothing to do with their file storage but
we have linked these ideas and suffered for it. Suppose we follow
the past and make Axiom "include" files which separate out the
signature information in a domain or category into separate files.
Then we could add an "include" statement. This way lies madness.

Consider what happens if you scale Axiom by a factor of 100 in
the next 30 years onto a petamachine. You end up with 110,000
domains and categories with roughly 1,100,000 functions. I don't
want 110K files. I want 110 books.



I have a library that must include 20 books on group theory. 
They each have a section on permutation groups. It would be more
"efficient" if there were a standardized "permutation group" booklet
that everyone referenced as "included" into their text. That way there
would be no duplication. But that misses the point of literate works.

The key point is not that I talk about permutation groups but that I
talk about them in a certain way, in a certain place, with a certain
style, for a certain audience. The fact that the information is
available elsewhere means nothing to the human.

And we're trying to write for humans, not for machines.

I want to send you one book that you can just sit and read.
Not read by computer, but sit and read for educational purposes.
And, as a side-effect, you can also compile and run it. The running
program illustrates the ideas in a way that you can build on them.
You can modify them, extend them, write about them, and distribute
them, solve problems with them. You can build on other people's work. 

We need to lift our eyes back to the humans, away from the technology.
Communicate, don't program.

Tim

Hi,

I am working with Axiom/Aldor on FreeBSD systems (FreeBSD 6.1 and 5.4,
gcl-2.6.6 and gcl-2.6.7). After Axiom compiles fine (with some with some
minor patches I will provide after cleaning up them). Especially the
Aldor part causes some serious headache.

Is anybody interested in or able to build a FreeBSD port?
... and is able to get compiler::link working for interpsys?

Gernot

I have not been successful building Axiom on FreeBSD.
I would like to see your patches.

Hi,

Here is the patchfile. Pls check.
util.ht is broken, but I think this is not a FreeBSD issue. I used one
from an older build and hyperdoc works again.

You need bash, gsed and gawk installed!
Install gcl from the ports with "--enable-ansi" removed from the
Makefile.

Go into bash, start ./configure, and follow the messages (exports +
gmake GCL...).

Aldor works fine in the emulator, but I think you need the
linux-develtools port.

Gernot

Gaby, Ralf, Cliff, Antoine, Alfredo, and others who I hope
I haven't forgotten:

Thank you all very much for the valuable comments, criticisms
and suggestions regarding the Axiom Wiki web site that you have
contributed to this thread. I have read each message carefully
although I have not responded specifically to everyone. I did
at least try to respond where I could help to explain something
or what I might have been thinking at the time of making (or just
sliding :) into an effective design decision about how the web
site should look and work. If I missed something don't hesitate
to ask or to repeat your comments.

Over the last few days, I did tried quite hard however to
incorporate as many of the suggested design changes as
practical in the, as usual, insufficient time and which my
limited availability allowed. Of course I couldn't do everything
and somethings I decided (unilaterally ;) that I didn't really
want to do. And there were some other changes I made were of
my own initiative. So I remain laregely responsible for the
overall result (both good and bad). Reviewing it again though
this morning my overal impression is quite positive. I think
that as a result of all of your suggestions these changes
have resulted in a better and significantly easier to use web
site with which to support the Axiom project. And I am very
interested in hearing your reactions.

This email is just to say "thanks" again, and to remind you
that this process is of necessity an on going one that will
likely never be finished and fully satisfactory... there is more
to do, so please keep your comments, criticisms and suggestions
coming! In particular, when you have a moment in the next few
days, could you please take a few minutes to look and play with
the Axiom Wiki web site and let me know of things that I might
have missed or anything that I have just done to the site that
you particularly dislike. Of course, when and where it is
possible you should also feel free as usual to continue to make
changes and improvements to the content yourselves. (That is
addressed to *everyone* on the Axiom developer email list! :)

I can't say for sure right now when I will next be able to
schedule some time like the last few days (and off-and-on
over the last month) to make additional changes that require
programming - now I really have to attend to other things for
a while - but you should feel free to comment and mention
them now anyway. Or another thing might be to submit a few
IssueTracker reports and feature enhancements and/or bugs.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Today appeared "A field-theory motivated approach to symbolic computer
algebra":http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.SC/0608005 which is of course very
interesting to me.  Anyone who has used any tensor package in any CAS
will sympathize with the  goals of the author.

The code is GPL and he even wrote a texmacs interface:

Bob,

Thanks very much for the reference to this new work. Having
actually written a tensor package for Maple a few years ago
and now contemplating the limitations of the CartesianTensor
domain in Axiom, I do have a great respect for this problem.

Whenever I see GPL these days my mind goes immediately to
thoughts of integrating the software into some other piece
of open source software with which I am more familiar. In
fact the number of open source packages is growing so rapidly
that we really have a large number of options. Already there
is a TeXmacs interface. Interfacing to MathAction to provide
a common web interface should be very easy. Some sort of
integration between Cadabra and Axiom would be nice - but
how to solve the problem of interfacing with lisp and passing
symbolic expressions? Another option we have to consider now
also is the potential for integration with Sage.

Any ideas about this?

There is another recent paper and a package, this one written
in Aldor on a similar subject of symbolic vector algebra, by
some people in the group where Steven Watt is a principle
resarcher. I sent the email request attached below for
information about the source code, but I have not heard back
from them yet.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Sirs;

I read with great interest in your publication:

Component-free vector algebra in Aldor, Songxin Liang,
David J. Jeffrey and Stephen M. Watt, pp. 415-418,
Proc. Transgressive Computing 2006: A conference in honor or
Jean Della Dora , (TC 2006), April 24-26 2006, Granada Spain.

http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~watt/pub/reprints/2006-tc-vectalg.pdf

In the paper you state:

"Because of space limitations, this description of the
program is necessarily brief, and omits most details. However,
the source code for the program will be made available on the
Aldor web site, from where it may be downloaded and inspected."

However I have not been able to locate this source code at
www.aldor.org and it seems that the Aldor web site may not
have been updated for some time. I would be very pleased if
you could direct me to the appropriate location or if you
could send me this code by email.

As an example of the application of your work that I have in
mind, you might refer to:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxCategoricalRelativity

And of course I would be very interested in hearing about
other work of this kind.

Sincerely,
Bill Page.

You won't believe, but I agree. The literate idea contradicts Java's 
one-file-per-class.

But what I think is important is, not just to write HUGE files that 
nobody can manage anymore, but to add a bit of structure to it. Nowadays 
we could write a whole book into just one latex file. But I bet, most 
people structure that via several files to keep things manageable (in 
the head not because of the file system).

We should also note that we are not yet at a point where we can really 
start to work on the mathematics that we all love to do. We are 
struggeling with the building process. So my suggestion/convention is 
just to keep the build simple. If you come up with a better one, welcome.

I think any convention is better then the mess we currently have. What I 
have seen in the Axiom build process is one-pamphlet-per-Makefile. That 
is very much JAVA-like. One would have ONE document that describes the 
whole build process, that is clear. But that document is a generated one 
(dvi/pdf/...) but not necessarily just ONE pamphlet.

If you have the dvi, click on it and your editor jumps directly to the 
appropriate source, you would not even care how the file is called. But 
if you impose a certain structure on the files (like the 
Makefile.am.pamphlet structure that Gaby is going to create), the whole 
build process can be described a lot easier, since it relies on the 
standard GNU Autotools. If you put all the various Makefile.am files 
into just ONE big pamphlet, you even need a description (and some shell 
script) that extracts all those different files from your .pamphlet. 
Note that you would have to call notangle several times.

If everyone adopts his own conventions of what files are in the 
pamphlet, that basically means that everyone provides his own (certainly 
non-standard) scripts to transform the pamphlet into actual source code.
I don't think I would call that manageable, even if the pamphlet 
describes what it does. Conventions/Rules are the way to go.

One rule we already have: Everything should be a pamphlet.
Next rule should be that there has to be a certain structure of the 
pamphlet so that a number of the pamphlets can be used to produce one 
document (a book if you like) that describes the build, another set of 
pamphlets (that need not be disjoint from the first one) that describes 
the interpreter etc. (But the "certain" above is still unclear, at least 
I want that there is no \documentclass, \begin{document}, \end{document} 
anymore.--The \usepackage is a problem, I know and have not yet a good 
solution.)

If you think that IDE's are just for that purpose, I think you missed 
something. You get more than that. For example, if your mouse moves over 
a function, you see its API description. You could click and jump to the 
definition of the function. Right, that sounds like programming, but 
even if we write pamphlets we finally have to write some code so if your 
IDE would bring you immediately to the section where the function that 
you want to use is described/defined, that would be convenient and make 
your work more productive. It is just another workflow you have to 
become accustomed to.

And somehow you have to turn all the codepieces into an actual source 
code of a certain programming language. Pamphlets are nice, but it is a 
bit hard to debug the code that comes out. You know, we are all not 
perfect, so debugging is still an issue.

OK, an example: My Aldor program tells me that there is an error in
the + function. How long would it take you to find the right function 
definition without a compiler telling you a line number, if you have 100 
definitions of + in you 10,000 lines pamphlet? Even having just 10 
definitions of +. It's a waste of time if I am looking at the wrong 
place in 90% of the cases.

If I use a category like "Ring" I am surely NOT going to "include" a 
definition of "Ring" into my code. It is completely enough for me if the 
"Ring" that appears in my code+description is a hyperlink and leads me 
to the right place in the generated DVI/PDF/HTML. Especially if you 
think of the web as a big document, why would you want to include and 
reproduce all existing things again and again?

Yes. But if your editor would not even tell you how many different files 
your document consists of, why would you care whether you have 110K or 
220K or just 110 files? We don't yet have the right tools to abstract 
from the file system.

I support this idea. But somebody has to provide the underlying 
technology, right? And Axiom partly is or will become such a system. You 
don't want to start from the very beginning, but you want to draw a 
line. You don't explain how a computer is built if you want to speak 
about permutation groups.

And the "book" idea is good, but it is not perfect. You have already 
said that you want to write books for different people, look from a 
different perspective onto the same data. So wouldn't it be nice to have 
all these data (= some information) split into atoms that could be put 
together to new molecules (=books)? Read about the LEO system, they 
basically have such an idea of different view onto the same data.

And actually, if we used our Wiki more extensively, also that could 
provide different views onto Axiom. I think, even in 20 years the 30 
years horizon is still that far away.

+1 For sure. Leo is a "new generation" literaterate programming
tool that is well worth looking into. I think we would learn
a lot about Axiom if we were to set up a Leo environment of
building Axiom.

>=20

++1 Double for sure! :) I would very much like to continue to
explore this possibility :( if I ever find some more time ):

To put it crudely in the vernacular of the current generation:

"We don't need no stink'n 2000 page book! We're web connected."

Seriously, I think the web (the whole web, not just what fits
on your desktop) is the only technology that can solve this
sort of problem at the "peta-scale" that, as Tim has suggested,
is nearlly here already. Unfortunately we are only just being
to learn how to build such systems.

Bill Page.

Bingo.  When I started trying to write Maximabook way back when, one of
the first things I did was learn how to combine individual files using
a "master" control document file.  Even if the editor can handle tens
of thousands of lines (and syntax highlighting those lines!) I can't
parse that much information without help.

I prefer the idea of "one file per concept", which happens to map
fairly well to the journal/academic paper model if we want an Axiom
journal.  I envision the algebra structure as being composed of "core"
files which implement the basic foundations the system is built on and
most basic functionality (e.g. the current pamphlets) and then seeing
the system gradually expand in two ways.  1)  individual papers
(pamphlets) contributed via journal or individual authors having to do
with specific subjects 2)  as the quality of individual contributions
is proven and they become more central to the functionality being
implemented, fold the individual paper or papers that are becoming
"core" into the main file pertaining to that subject (so in a core
file, "chapters" or maybe "sections" would have their own subject
categorization.  Or, using MSC, we have one file for each "top-level"
category that implements the standard functionality of Axiom for that
mathematical domain, and papers in sub-topics that address more
specific areas.

This could also address a concern I have with the wiki and "open"
nature of Axiom - namely, that Axiom is not really a "peer-reviewed"
work.  Normal open source is "potentially" peer-reviewed, meaning
anybody can review it but it is not guaranteed that it has been
reviewed.  The wiki content, by design, is even less guaranteed to be
"correct" in any academically verified sense.  This could pose a
problem with being accepted for use in academic work - e.g. the lack of
authority behind the conceptual correctness of the work in question. 
The question arises - "is this functionality I'm using written by
someone who knows what he/she is doing, and/or has it been checked and
verified by someone who can recognize when it's working incorrectly?" 
The "core" files in each subject will be Axiom's "branded"
functionality - the functionality that we as a project stand behind as
being high quality.  There are a few other ideas that need exploring
here, like systematic peer review of functionality, but I think it is
an important question that will bear on the acceptance of Axiom into
the academic community in the future.  Wikipedia faces the same issue -
how do you know what you're reading is written by someone who knows
what they are doing, and doesn't just represent "common wisdom?"

I think we are moving in that direction.  Axiom is a complex system, so
there are certain limitations to the build simplicity, but I am very
glad to see a configure/make/make install routine arrive - I think that
is a very important first step.

As I understand it, the autotools will eventually get us close to that
goal.  I think we won't be able to reduce it beyond an autotools build
process triggering a lisp based build process, but that IMHO is the
best possible situation.  Maxima was brought to that point some time
ago and the system has been remarkably successful - I think it shows
"the way forward" for large free lisp programs in general.  Autotools
interfaces with the "normal" software development world (as well as
handling a score of practical points we don't want to worry about), and
lets us keeps the "lisp and beyond" parts in Lisp, which has a number
of advantages from a development standpoint.  Autotools +
defsystem/asdf is a very powerful and flexible setup.

I experimented with this some time ago, actually - having the actual
content be in a "content-only" latex file, and having two types of
"top-level" files - one that pulled several "content-only" files into a
book, and the other type (a standard file for all pamphlet files which
could be altered on an individual file basis) which would let the user
print an individual "paper".  IIRC there wasn't much interest in this
at the time and I abandoned the experiment.

One illustration of presenting information in different ways might be
illustrated by the dimensions example.  In the units paper, I need to
explain several programming concepts "polymorphism" in order to make
sense of how to express dimensional ideas in a computer algebra system.
 Now, if we make all of Axiom fully literate there will undoubtedly be
a "proper" explanation of polymorphism somewhere in the compiler part
of the software, but I'll want to explain it with respect to the units
code because someone reading up on units is probably doing it for
scientific work in the physical sciences.  Thus, an explanation of
polymorphism for a programmer might be less useful to a physical
scientist than the explanation targeted for that particular audience.

However, I agree that in general a link to an explanation is preferable
- we should avoid information duplication which does provide a real
benefit to the end user.
 
Cheers,
CY

Hi,

I have managed to build interpsys with dlopen in the image.
Next step is to use dlopen, which in fact is the more interesting part.
Has anybody experience with dlopen yet?

Regards

Gernot

Dear Bill et al,

I'm not sure whether intentional or not:

* the wiki menu (especially the item "changes") is missing now. I very much
  liked to click on it on the FrontPage, though, and I also think it is
  interesting for people who come by only occasionally.

* The boxes "Download and Try online" now appear nested inside of
  "Documentation". This looks quite weird. (At least on Konqueror 3.1.4, I
  don't have any other browser installed here, unfortunately)

Thanks in any case for your work and your thoughts about fighting spam...

(very sad that this is necessary)

Martin

Well, I think the "changes" button should be there. It also gives people a hint
that this is a wiki.

OK, good to know that this is a browser problem and not intentional.

There seem to be two main packages for taking complete individual latex
documents and combining them into larger ones (if I've missed an
important one, please let me know)

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/combine/

http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfiles/

I'm thinking combine looks like it might be a good fit for the "combine
various pamphlets into a book" question, but I have no experience with
it (yet).  Has anyone here happened to use it?  Does it work fairly
well?

Cheers,
CY

Hi,

see below for results. elf-test and the loader-stuff is based on
gcl-elf-loader (http://www.copyleft.de/Lisp).
System is FreeBSD 5.4, Axiom--main--1-patch-49 and Aldor 1.0.3


Howto:

Maybe not all of my changes are really necessary.
(I use a gcl compiled with dlopen enabled)

1) Generate a gclelf (Makefile of gcl-elf-loader)
Minor changes to the elf-loader.lsp file, due to that defCfun causes a
compile error:

[...]
(defentry cast-obj2int (object) (int cast_obj2int))
;;(defCfun "int cast_obj2int(s) object s;" 0
;;  " return( (int) s->st.st_self);" )
(clines "int cast_obj2int(s) object s; { object *vs=3Dvs_top; object
*old_top=3Dvs_top+0; { return( (int) s->st.st_self); } vs_top=3Dvs; } ")
[...]


2) Adapt lsp/Makefile to build obj/${syslisp}/bin/lisp from gclelf
e.g. for gcl-system:

[...]
        echo '(compiler::link
'"'"'("/home/hueber/src/test/elf-loader.o") "${OUT}/lisp" (format nil
"(progn (let ((*load-path* (cons ~S *load-path*))(si::*load-types* ~S))
(compiler::emit-fn t))(when (fboundp (quote si::sgc-on)) (si::sgc-on
t))(setq compiler::*default-system-p* t))" si::*system-directory* (quote
(list
".lsp"))) "${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.o
${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/libspad.a -lc")' | /home/hueber/src/test/gclelf
        ln -fs /usr/local/lib/gcl-2.6.7/h ${MNT}/${SYS}/
[...]

3) use the generation of interpsys proposed by Camm
(http://www.mail-archive.com/gcl-devel@gnu.org/msg00576.html)

[...]
        @ (cd ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin ; \
          echo '#+native-reloc(progn (gbc t) (setq x
si::*system-directory*)(load "${OUT}/makeint.lisp") (setq
si::*system-directory* x) (unintern (quote x))(gbc t)(user::spad-save
"${SAVESYS}"))#-native-reloc(progn \
                        (setq si::*collect-binary-modules* t)\
                        (setq x si::*system-directory*)\
                        (load "${OUT}/makeint.lisp")\
                        (setq si::*system-directory* x)\
                        (unintern (quote x))\
                        (compiler::link \
                                (remove-duplicates
si::*binary-modules* :test (quote equal))\
                                "$(SAVESYS)" \
                                (format nil "\
                                        (let ((si::*load-path* (cons ~S

                                              (si::*load-types* ~S))\

Hello,

What about adding recent source tarballs on MathAction
(http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources) even for Windows.
If I remember correctly I downloaded the axiom--windows--1 branch, in
the past, from Linux (some difficulties to have a functional tla).

Greg

Martin,

There was a small coding error on the FrontPage. Some browsers
are more sensitive to these errors than others. It should
be ok now.

For "changes" you should now click "What's New".

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have once tried "combine". But IIRC it only takes the \usepackage(s) 
from the first file. For the other files \usepackage just absorbs its 
argument and does nothing. So it is not a real solution for me.

When I saw the hyperlink in endpaper.pamhlet that linked to a .dvi file, 
I tried another idea. Basically along the following lines...
Remember I want to combine (crosslink) the documentation of different 
aldor libraries which are each by themselves consisting of several noweb 
files. I think it is doable to compile the first library documentation 
(dvi-1), then use the .aux file from that compilation and use it in the 
compilation of the second library documentation (dvi-2). One would still 
have 2 .dvi files, but if you open dvi-2 and click on a link that refers 
to something in dvi-1, then the dviviewer opens dvi-1 at the right page.
As a user you would not even recognize that these are two files. That 
would be OK for me. And there would be no problem with \usepackage since 
an author could use anything she likes.

Unfortunately, I am not very far with an implementation. What would 
people think about such an approach?

Ralf

look at src/doc/booklet

this file reads chunknames and allows URLs such as

and will insert foo inline.

Hi Bill,

First of all, a big THANKS to you.

But may I ask you why there is still a link

"Literate Source"

on the FrontPage? What were your reasons for leaving it just next to 
"Source Code"? I think that is confusing. There should be just ONE link 
to the sources.

If you really want to make it obvious that we have a way to edit a 
branch, then I think a better place is just a statement like

"Browse and edit sources online (see below)"

You could make this a link to the bottom of the page.
In the Section "Testing" I would then add a new subsection "Browse and 
edit sources online". There it should be described how one can 
contribute back and how these changes find their way to Silver and Gold.

Ralf

PS: Comparison, Programming, and Screenshots is wrongly indented on the 
Frontpage.

I find it a bit strange to read "Bug Reports" under the heading "Try 
online".

Same for "UnrelatedLinks" appearing under "Related Links". Sorry, but I 
even don't have a better idea. Somebody else perhaps?

I think there is a variable to grab additional usepackage commands from
other files, but it's not the default.  I'll look more closely.  Thanks
for the thumbs up on your combine experience Martin, that's good to
hear.

I think I can put together a reasonable test case with the sistyle?
package which formats things according to the NIST formatting rules for
units.  There will be some cases where package load order is important
and we might have to figure out something to take care of that issue,
but I would think it's doable.

My first question is whether this would work for formats beyond dvi,
such as pdf.  Also, it doesn't seem able to produce a "printable" book
which incorporates the individual files.  For online linking it sounds
interesting.

It sounds interesting, but I think my first instinct is to see if
combine can incorporate "usepackage" commands from mulitple files.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think your idea Ralf and the combine
packages goals are slightly different - combine aimes to produce
something you could bind up and sell as a paper archive of a
conference, and your work enables intelligent hyperlinking between dvi
documents.  Am I not understanding properly?

Cheers,
CY

What does that have to do with the problem that appears when different 
pamphlet files rely on different and maybe even conflicting latex packages?

For code chunks your URL extension seems to make sense though. But we 
want both, documentation and code.

Oh, that might be true. But what does that help if you want to combine 
pamphlets from different authors who use conflicting latex packages???

Should work. I think I have once seen linking from one pdf to another in 
acroread. But I have no explicit running example available. :-( But I 
see no big difference between pdf and dvi.

What do you actually want? Can't you produce a book which is a 
collection of works? Look at conference proceedings, they do it all the 
time. I don't care so much about a 1000 pages book. If you don't like to 
read stuff online, print it. If you have just 100 pages, it is not so 
heavy. ;-) I care more for the hyperlinks. That also adds some value if 
you really want to find information quickly inside a book.

For example, you take some book and read the word "ring". Tell me in a 
few seconds whether the author speaks of a ring with or without a 1. If 
"ring" is a hyperlink to its definition, that is easy. You don't have to 
browse backwards to find the phrase:

   For this and only this chapter all our rings have a 1.

Some time ago I looked into combine, but I gave up since one needs to 
make sure that the packages that authors use do not conflict each other.
(Start with the packages verbatim, fancyvrb, moreverb, each of them 
appearing in a \usepackage of a different pamphlet. I have not tested 
whether they are really conflicting, but it pretty much looks like that 
and you surely find other examples.

The booklet program could easily strip the \documentstyle and other
header/trailer information and collect up the \usepackage information.
It's only a simple prototype of the idea intended to allow us to play
with various ways of combining pamphlets into a book form.

Hello,

my name is Frithjof Schulze. I'm currently trying to understand Axiom
and am very much interested in computer algebra systems and computer
algebra in general. Though I don't know much yet I'm disposed to learn.
I like Axiom and what you are trying to do (that is the 30 year
horizon), and would like to help you to achieve that goal. Also I think
I will learn pretty much that way.

I have no practical experience in projects much bigger than textbook
exercises let alone open source projects this big. So presumably I can
not do much coding now and will just have lot of questions. Is it OK, if
I ask some of them here?

Still, I'm studying mathematics and already know Common Lisp fairly
well. At some point in the near future I should know enough about the
mathematics and the code to be able to contribute.

What I can do now is this: While reading the Axiom documentation I saw a
lot of stuff that I think I could improve even with my current
knowledge. In particular in volume one of the Axiom-Book, that I think
addresses newbies like myself, I would like too clarify some parts that
weren't clear to me in the beginning. Also I would like to rearrange
some parts, to make the tutorial a better reading. 

Would that be welcomed? If yes, shall I post patches here or directly to
Sourceforge or somewhere else?

Maybe you are right. One reason maybe is just a matter of
pride since I still think having the source online as
literate programs is a pretty cool idea and I want people
to be sure to see it. And I do think the whole literate
programming thing is very important to Axiom and we that
we can't really emphasize that too much.

All that sounds good to me. Of course one would have to actually
make this work first, I guess. :)

Fixed. Thanks.

This is the right place.

Feel free to post changes to the tutorial. Beginner's mind eyes are
always welcome.

At the moment, the way to get changes into the main path is to
post patch files. the sequence, for a file Foo, is

cp Foo Foo.org
(edit Foo, save changed file)
diff -Naur Foo.org Foo >Foo.patch
post the patch file

There is a version online that can be edited. But that seems to be an
much older version than for example the one in the silver branch.

Of course. But which one? And do we have the source somewhere?
Or would someone have to re-key it?

Obviously, it doesn't.  However, I'm hopeful that such conflicts will either 
be minimal and easily resolved, or we can improve the latex packages 
themselves.

PDF and Acrobat Reader are common on Windows, DVI is not.  Other than that, I 
would tend to agree.

Indeed, that's the purpose of the combine package, as I understand it.

Oh, true.  I am probably more concerned with the idea of a printed set of 
books than most - call it a desire to see the work put into Axiom survive in 
some form even if we lose our current technology levels - "disaster recovery" 
so to speak ;-).  I'm hopeful that the quality of work done on this system 
will be such that it will be worth taking steps to ensure its preservation 
over hundreds or maybe even thousands of years.

Yes, that's an ongoing issue with LaTeX.  However, it might be regarded as 
bugs to be fixed, as much as anything else.

Yes.  But it would be a benefit both to Axiom and to the wider LaTeX community 
to have such issues addressed.

I'm going away on vacation for a week, sunday to sunday,
and won't have net access (New Jersey is still in the
dark ages wrt internet). I hope to make great strides on
Axiom, cause isn't that what vacation is for? :-)

Oh, that tutorial! :)

But ???

All of the original book volumes have been online and on the Axiom
Wiki as editable pamphlet files since about October last year when
I first implemented pamphlet file support on MathAction.

See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1

Volume 1 is here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/Bookvol1

The most recent comment was by Frithjof Schulze just yesterday.
He wrote:

Working drafts ? --Frithjof Schulze, Thu, 03 Aug 2006 08:58:37

On ../AxiomDocumentation it says that this are working drafts.
Doesn't that mean that it are the newest versions? I was reading
the tutorial and thought about changing some things. Later I saw
that in Axiom Silver there is a newer and better version of the
tutorial. Does it make any sense to work on this one?

------------

Unfortunately it seems that no one beside me was subscribed to
to the book--main--1 wiki page.

Apparently it has not been kept up to date with the version in
the source distribution. :(

But perhaps you will recall that work I did with

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/Endpaper3

involving GraphViz with hyperref links to the source?

----------

I thought you meant something like the tutorial that was done by
NAG in Texplorer. I remember now that way back in the early days
I did prepare a TeXmacs version of that tutorial by importing the
original tex source and then editing back in the actual Axiom
commands.

http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/axiom/tutorial.tgz.gz

The pdf version of this tutorial is here:

http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/axiom/tutorial.pdf

I think it could be easily adapted for use as a set of easialy
updated tutorial web pages on the wiki.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I guess we really do live in different worlds, don't we ... :(
See my previous email about the 

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1

pamphlet files. All of these volumes can be updated directly through
the web. We can create diffs of these against the versions in the
current source distribution and vice versa. Maybe we could even
hack together a good way to make periodic automatic commits from
one to the other.

Right now the version on the web is about 9 months old and was
based on the tla archive by the same name. I don't know the status
of that archive relative to the versions of similar files in the
axiom--main--1 source distribution.

I guess we should make some kind of effort to coordinate this
and make sure everything is upto date and in sync before deciding
how best to proceed with large scale edits. No?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I agree with this, but what's more, I don't think that linking "Try
Axiom" to the SandBox is that helpful.  If a visitor to the webpage
wants to give Axiom a quick try, sending them to a lengthy discussion
of the sandbox might be discouraging.  Perhaps a link to a
"TryingAxiom" page which has a couple of lines of how to try it out
might be helpful.  I'd be happy to give it a shot myself, if desired.

Also, I don't think it's necessary (or even desirable) to keep all the
old tried-out commands in the wiki.  I think a link to a page which
interactively runs Axiom would be more desirable: Yacas has something
like that (Yacas runs in a Java applet: 
http://yacas.sourceforge.net/yacasconsole.html)  and Maxima does also
(http://math.msarnoff.org/).

By the way, I'm entering the discussion late.  I don't recall what the
front page looked like, but I recall thinking it looked a bit
unfriendly.  (Of course, my memory may be wrong.)  Now I think it
looks great!

Jay

:( Well, I really like the example ... in fact I have even given
a wild thought to how we might make the from page choose randomly
between a large set of similar examples so that a visitor might
be treated to a new one at each visit ...

I still don't know what is meant by the phrase "visual load".

Really??! As far as I can see this is actually one of the most
frequently used wiki features of this web site.

Perhaps it is verbose but it does not seem to be very discouraging
given the number of quick tries that we record.

Yes, I think it is very desirable. Please give it a try.

That's true. Anytime anyone feels like cleaning up all the crap
they are certainly welcome to do it. :) But every once in a while
there seems to be something very useful that can be easily
generalized and made useful for other people. That is what wikis
are for. I keep getting this sinking feeling that almost no one
hear on this list understands anything about wikiwiki. :(

To me these interfaces seem trivial and nearly useless. But if we
really do want something like this then it is easily done.

I am glad you are here. Your comments are very much appreciated.

Yes, it has gone through quite a few revisions over the last
6 months and it is still evolving. It is a community effort.

Jose,

I've been chasing a couple pointers to try to look at the drag-and-drop
issue in Doyen. These are the big five:

First, javascript has a drag-and-drop set of events, ondrag, ondragstart,
ondragend, ondragenter, ondragleave, and ondragover. These allow javascript
code to know where the user starts and ends a drag.

Second, javascript can get at the clipboarddata allowing us to pass data
to the browser thru the clipboard.

Both of those are covered in the JavaScript Bible by Danny Goodman

Third, firefox allows you to code extensions in javascript. Extensions
are local and are allowed to read/write the file system, etc. The game
is to create a directory structure containing your code, zip it up,
and put it in the chrome subdirectory. A tutorial example is at:
  http://daly.axiom-developer.org/firefox.tgz

Fourth, a more detailed example of a working extension is at:
  http://daly.axiom-developer.org/dbx.tgz

Fifth, the XMLHttpRequest object is a javascript object that allows
you to construct an XML request without leaving the page. You store
data in the object, invoke the send method, and then go thru a 5-state
machine to get the information back. If Axiom is set up to listen for
the requests then Axiom can sit behind the browser and service requests
to d anything, like start graphics independently or start graphics and
store the resulting image and forward it to the browser for inlining.

So the game is to pick on a literate document, drag it onto the browser,
fire up a firefox extension to read the clipboard, write the file into
the appropriate place, and then talk to axiom to compile and load the
file and build the documentation. I know this can be done but everything
is moving at a glacial pace due to multitasking.

I'm going on vacation next week and I'll try to get an example working
if time permits (which it never does).

Tim

Any luck identifying GCL-specific code and writing "generic macros"?

I understand "swamped with work" as I'm just now getting a chance to
reply to week-old emails.

I don't have any objection to having Axiom listed on your site
but it is important that the information be at least semi-correct.
Google has a way of preserving both good and bad information and
it hurts the Axiom project to list it as "unchanged for 2 years".

Please list us but please take the time to get it right.

Tim

I just saw your request at the bottom of your homepage 
for people to send you a note about downloading SAGE.

I've downloaded it twice so far. I was part of the team
that built the DVDs for the ISSAC 2006 conference proceedings
and I included a copy of SAGE on them.

I've also downloaded it today to look at the issue of 
adding Axiom to your list of available system.

I'd suggest you take a look at the Doyen project, outlined here:

   http://daly.axiom-developer.org/doyen
   http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Doyen
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/doyencd


The basic idea is that technical papers are written in a literate
style that includes both latex and source code (using noweb, a
derivative of Knuth's Web idea).

Doyen will integrate a browser, a wiki, and several CA systems.
We're investigating the ability to drag-and-drop a literate
research paper onto the browser, have it automatically unpacked,
compiled, added to the system along with its documentation.
We hope to demonstrate this ability at the next ISSAC conference.

It might be interesting to put the SAGE technology behind the
browser and have Axiom as one of the back-end components.

Marc, 

Sorry for the delay but I had to catch up on the weeks worth of work
that I didn't do at ISSAC. I have the files and will look at integrating
them into Axiom.

I now have a working subversion and will look at keeping silver

I've asked Bill Page to put the tutorial up on the wiki.
It should be possible to edit it there.
If you manage to change it there you'll be the first to try
the idea of maintaining the sources directly from the wiki
rather than from a CVS/TLA/SVN/DARCS pile.

Yes. Now we have Gold=stable, Silver=unstable, and several testing 
branches. See http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources .
The tutorial should be edited on one of the testing branches (either on
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/ or on a specially 
created branch on SVN).

I must say, I would like to see axiom--test--1 kept in sync with a 
branch on our sourceforge archive. I have no idea whether that is easy 
to achive, but it would avoid questions like "Where is the most 
up-to-date source that I should edit?".

The tla branch book--main--1 on http://axiom-developer.org/archive/axiom 
should be merged to the testing branch on SVN and then *REMOVED*.
Look at book--main--1. It does not contain the other axiom sources and 
when I first found out, I was confused about the 
src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet appearing in axiom--main--1 and the same file 
in book--main--1. Cannot we just have book-main--1 in a subdirectory of 
the ordinary Axiom/Gold/Silver/Testing? Nobody cares if the other 
volumes are not yet written, but it would be easier to know where to 
edit. And merging would proably also be easier.

Any other opinions about this?

We currently have more branches of Axiom than we have developers. And 
even worse, all these branches are quite badly documented what they are 
worth for.

1) If you need to edit the pamphlet files to make them work in the 
context of a big book. That sounds as if you have too much time to spare.

2) Where are our priorities? Improving LaTeX or improving computational 
mathematics?

I could imagine to impose restrictions on the LaTeX packages that are 
approved be used inside an Axiom pamphlet. But do you know all the LaTeX 
packages and the preferences of authors that you feel able to decide 
which package to allow and which package to forbid? I don't.

Hmm, yes, you could call it a bug. In fact, I know LaTeX not well enough 
to understand why it is so difficult to set up a wrapper file around a 
collection of latex files so that each file would appear (nearly) 
identical to the way it would appear as dvi when compiled separately.
The collection should, of course produce running page numbers.

And what I want is that links would be allowed between the parts. These 
links forbid an implementation that puts each part of the collection 
into a separate box, since there must be "communication" between them. 
So basically, it calls for a nicely defined API.

What I don't believe is that you can convince package authors to take 
every effort to keep their package compatible with any other package out 
there. Some people just write a package because they need it for their 
work and then suddenly it becomes useful for others. The was probably 
only a question that the package need to be compatible with packages 
that the original author used.

To honor the spirit of competition I have decided to create a Bronze branch.
The Bronze branch will collect all code deleted or modified from the Gold
and Silver branch plus original addition.
The intent is to have a more lively version of Axiom away from all the
restriction of cold mathematical logic.

That is one of the main advantage of the Bronze branch no need to stay in
sync it will have is own rhythm.

I think the solution is more SCM therefore the bronze branch will use  Linux
last creation git (
http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/200504-git.html.en )
If it is good for the kernel it is good for axiom.

The problem is not has much as the number of branch is that they are all
over the place.

Could we all agree to use only one SCM at least.
I will advocate for SVN has I am so far quite pleased with it. Also SVK make
it possible for people who work of line to do so easly.

The biggest advande I see is that all work will be visible for everybody.
And we should be able to use well understood concept of branching and
tagging to make release a clear and manageable process.

The online literate version of Axiom will just be one branch and even maybe
one should be able to choose wich version/branche to be use.

Also SVN is surely on his way to remplace CVS and therefore offer us a large
choice of project host if needed.

SVN work on all system *nix/Win/Mac

What do you think ?

I guessed that this was your thought, but I could only guess that 
because meanwhile I know a bit about the internals of Axiom.

I could edit the AxiomSources page with a prominent link to the literate 
sources at the top. In fact, you are right, the AxiomSources page should 
at least give a link to an explanation about what a *pamphlet* is or 
even contain a few words about pamplets itself.

But you should somehow think about how the modifications could be made 
in sync with an SVN branch. Or at least explain how that axiom--test--1 
is related to at least silver/trunk. I think axiom--test--1 should have 
ALL the patches of silver/trunk. Is that easily possible to achieve?

Is it possible to write an explanation how to browse and edit the 
sources and how and when the will be integrated into the Gold release.
It should even be said what will happen to modifications that are not 
approved. Anyway, I would feel better if the sources can only be edited 
by registed people, but maybe that is not yet an issue.

Bill, on http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src I see

___New Page___ [Create this page]

and a "folder" icon in front of it. So it seems I can create a folder, 
but not a file. But the text tells me I can create neither. It says, 
that I can create a page. Hmmmm, I find this confusing. Should there be 
two buttons to create a file and to create a directory? And it should be 
written somewhere that in the Wiki context page and pamphlet file is the 
same.

Oh, and I clicked onto [create this page]. Why does there pop up a 
password window?

Ralf

Hi Tim,

  The toplevel Makefile.dvi gets copied in the installation directory
twice:

     * once at part of 

   all: noweb ${MNT}/${SYS}/bin/Makefile.pamphlet
           @ echo 1 making a ${SYS} system, PART=${PART}
           SUBPART=${SUBPART}
           @ echo 2 Environment ${ENV}
           @ ${TANGLE} -t8 -RMakefile.${SYS} Makefile.pamphlet
           >Makefile.${SYS}
           @ ${DOCUMENT} Makefile
           @ mkdir -p ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src
           @ cp Makefile.dvi ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src/root.Makefile.dvi
           @ ${ENV} $(MAKE) -f Makefile.${SYS} 
           @echo 3 finished system build on `date` | tee >lastBuildDate


     * a second time, right after "making" the lsp directory

   <<LSPMakefile>>=
   ${LSP}/Makefile: ${LSP}/Makefile.pamphlet
           @echo 20 making ${LSP}/Makefile from ${LSP}/Makefile.pamphlet
           @( cd lsp ; \
            ${DOCUMENT} ${NOISE} Makefile ; \
            if [ "${GCLVERSION}" != "gcl-2.4.1" ] ; then \
            ${TANGLE} -t8 -R"${GCLVERSION}" Makefile.pamphlet >Makefile ; \
            fi )
           @cp Makefile.dvi ${MNT}/${SYS}/doc/src


Isn't that a bug?

Hi,

here are some minor modifications of bookvol1 and ComputerTutorial.

In bookvol1 there were two nearly identical sections about the "%"
macro. I removed one and moved a short explanation to the place "%" is
used the first time.

In ComputerTutorial I changed all occurences of "\<\<" in verbatim
environments into "<<" as (at least my) latex dosn't execute the
command there. I also added ComputerTutorial to the Makefile.phamphlet.

There is more duplication in the tutorial. I found that
distracting. Reading something I had already read, I got bored, started
to skip sections and finally was out of it. I would like to splice those
sections in where they belong or remove them. Is that an acceptable
policy?

Frithjof

Hi,

   This patchlet adds support for the traditional

      ./configure && make && make install

There no longer should be a need to set and export the variables AXIOM
and PATH before doing make.

The other version I had was doing a major overhall of toplevel
Makefile.  To allow people follow the changes, I decided on this
alternative way of doing it.  Nevertheless, the current Makefiles
remain a big mess :-(

Tested on i686-suse-linux and i686-redhat-linux.

-- Gaby

2006-08-05  Gabriel Dos Reis  <gdr@cs.tamu.edu>

	Provide support for "./configure && make && make install".
	* build-setup.sh: Generate Makefile.in too.

	* configure.ac.pamphlet (must_set_AXIOM): Don't ask user to
	set the AXIOM variable.
	* configure.ac: Regenerate.
	* configure: Regenerate.

	* Makefile.pamphlet (do-all): New target.  Rename from target all.
	(all): Export the variable AXIOM, then make do-all.
	(VERSION): Update.
	* Makefile.in: Generate.

Not too much yet, unfortunately - my original push was trying to see
how much of the axiom build process I could complete in sbcl, and I
stalled out a bit after discovering that all the effort on the boot dir
was essentially redundant.  A few not very exciting functions are about
all I have to show for that effort, unfortunately.  I put them at the
end of  this message just in case anybody ever wants to do something
similar.

A question Tim, if I may.  In looking at sys-pkg.lisp, it seems like
there are a rather large number of import and export commands contained
there.  Is this normal in lisp to have to hand-import and hand-export
so many symbols?  Also, I'm a bit confused by the BOOT and VMLISP
package relations - are they in fact cross-pollinating and importing
from/exporting to each other?  If so, wouldn't it be a bit cleaner to
get the common functionality into one package and have both BOOT and
VMLISP use that one?

As an example of a problem I don't yet understand:  in sys-pkg.lisp,
there is code of the form:

(lisp:import '(
#+:GCL    SYSTEM:DEFINE-MACRO 
#+:GCL    SYSTEM:MEMQ 
#+:GCL    SYSTEM:PNAME
          BOOT:|directoryp|))

I have changed this file somewhat for sbcl (the diff is at the very end
of the email) and I can load sys-pkg.lisp successfully after this.  But
if I try to compile the file, I get:

* (compile-file "./interp/sys-pkg.lisp")

The symbol "directoryp" is not external in the BOOT package.

Does anyone know why loading would succeed when compiling fails? 

I'm beginning to think that refactoring this into ANSI lisp might have
to be sort of an ongoing thing - start by defining one piece of
functionality, and add in more as it becomes clear.  So far I'm aware
of the History mechanism and the Frames mechanism thanks to bookvol5,
the SPAD compiler, and whatever we are calling the current B-natural
like mechanism that handles actual user input.  Undoubtedly there are
more pieces I'm not even aware of.  I am able to get sys-pkg to work
with asdf by removing the directoryp reference above, but I have no
idea what its purpose is, what breaks when I do that, etc. :-(.  Not
doubt many more such problems await.

Lisp code for bootstrap:

These are set up in order to let me get at things like the notangle
command and filenames from lisp.  The results of the directory command
on lisp doesn't provide strings as such, so with the help of #lisp I
put these together.  I think this is likely to be made completely
useless by the autotools work, though - I don't know if we will ever do
this from lisp.  These are only defined in sbcl, but other
implementation specific code can certainly be added - I just don't know
at the moment what is needed.

(defun pathname-to-string (file)
 #+sbcl (sb-ext:native-namestring file)
   )

(defun run-ext-program (string args out)
 #+sbcl (sb-ext:run-program string args :input nil :output out :wait t)
   )

(defun pamphletname-to-filename (file)
   (subseq (pathname-to-string file) 0 
           (position #\. (pathname-to-string file) :from-end t)))

This was my "run notangle from lisp" code using the above.  Again
rather specific to the bootstrap problem, and not likely of importance
for the future.  I should mention the above definitions and the
contents below were in a separate setup directory so they didn't erase
themselves ;-).

Not really.  I take it you regard the idea as frivolous?

As a literate project I would think typesetting technology and
conventations are very important to our effort.  Also different members
of the project with different skill sets may have varying priorities -
those less skilled as mathematical researchers can attack other
problems.

Surely it could be discussed as it came up.  I don't imagine there
would be more than a dozen or so key packages (some of which are
already on our radar screen) and if over time a few more came up we
could deal with it on a case by case basis.

Because latex packages sometimes change the way output is produced from
commands.  If two different packages redefine the same command, there
is a collision and one of the papers won't get what it expects.  More
difficult, sometimes there are mutually exclusive options which must be
resolved one way or another between packages.

There are also desirable features such as a common table of contents
and index.

Probably.  But then, for the purposes of Axiom, why not take that
package to the next level and make it a more general tool?  I fully
expect that Axiom will eventually push the bounds of LaTeX's
typesetting abilities, and I think this is a good thing.  Human
readable mathematical documents are a very interesting problem in
themselves - Knuth solved many of those problems well but some things
like automatic line breaking are still imperfectly solved, at best.

Anyway.  It's possible I am underestimating the difficulties involved,
but the only way to know for sure is experimentation.

Cheers,
CY

Note that Axiom was written before common lisp existed. The initial
common lisps and other prior lisps (like MACLISP, VMLISP, etc) did
not have the idea of a "package" so I had to globally modify the
code to make it work in common lisp (some of which had incompatible
implementations before the standard).

SYS-PKG was a hack to enable/disable package symbols in various lisps.
It is poorly designed, badly implemented, horribly documented, and
unmaintained. I think they should transfer the programmer who wrote
it to a non-lisp related job or (equivalently) lift his license to 
program. In short, it is a hack and will go away in the rewrite.

Hello,

I'm working on a tex to mathml program in C.  It's rudimentary and
only meant to transform the stuff between the $$ signs that comes
out of axiom so it can be displayed in firefox.  However it seems
to work so I thought I should make it available in case someone
was interested. 

My question is what license I should use?  My first inclination is to
use the GPL except that axiom is released under the BSD license.
Does it make any difference?

Arthur Ralfs

Yes please do. I am definitely interested. I presume that you are
aware that there exist a few other packages that do this? Bob
McElrath has done some work with integrating MathML output with
LatexWiki - the software on which the Axiom Wiki is based. See:

http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki

But we have not yet adopted any of these methods for use with
Axiom.

In my opinion definitely GPL, but no it does really make much
difference.

Hi Gaby,

it turned out that it is not totally easy to mimic the behaviour of 
notangle, in particular if multiline chunks have to be indented correctly.

Below you find rhxtangle.pl.pamphlet. I hope you find it useful to drop 
the initial noweb dependency for the configuration phase of Axiom.

Ralf

\title{A Poor Man's NoTangle}
\author{Ralf Hemmecke}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In order to drop the dependency of the configuration step of
  \xAxiom{} on \xNoweb{} we present a \xPerl{} program that basically
  behaves like a simple version of the \texttt{notangle} program from
  \xNoweb{}.
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

\section{Introduction}
\xAxiom{} is written in a literate programming style using \xNoweb{}.
That means that (nearly) all sourcefiles of \xAxiom{} are actually
\LaTeX{} files with additional code chunks that are of the form
\begin{verbatim}
@<<code chunk name@>>=
some code comes here
@@
\end{verbatim}
These special files are known to \xAxiom{} developers as
\defineterm{pamphlet} files and come with the extension
\texttt{.pamphlet}. The source file of this text is one example of a
\useterm{pamphlet} file.

Since also the configuration files for \xAxiom{} should be written as
\useterm{pamphlet} files, it would be nice to depend on as few
prerequisites as possible. \xNoweb{} is not by default installed on
every computer. We replace a dependency on \xNoweb{} by a dependency
on \xPerl{} since \xAutomake{} from the GNU Autotools depends on
\xPerl{}, too and writing the script is relatively easy.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{What do we want?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The script should be called via
\begin{verbatim}
perl rhxtangle.pl file.ext.pamphlet > file.ext
\end{verbatim}
in order to tangle the code in the same way \texttt{notangle} does.

The output of \texttt{rhxtangle} and \texttt{notangle} should be
identical modulo the translation of tabs to spaces done by
\texttt{notangle} and modulo spaces at the end of a line.

Currently \texttt{rhxtangle} does not translate tabulators to spaces
and removes trailing spaces and tabulators.

In order to keep our script simple, we impose some restrictions to the
file format.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We only accept one file on the command line and no options.
\item Code chunks \emph{must} be ended by an \verb'@' sign in the
  first column.
\item Inside code chunks an \verb'@' sign is forbidden in the first
  column.
\item Double square brackets may not appear inside double angle
  brackets.
\item A code chunk name may not contain \verb'@<<' or \verb'@>>', not
  even if they are escaped by an \verb'@' sign.
\item Double angle brackets, i.e. \verb'@<<', that should not be
  considered as part of a code chunk use \emph{must} be escaped by
  \verb'@'.
\item No translation of initial whitespace takes place, so it is
  important for Makefile to already contain tabulator characters at
  the corresponding places.  
\end{enumerate}

The last item is a major difference between our implementation and
\texttt{notangle}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How to extract code chunks?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The input file can basically be seen as a collection of code chunks.

Our script works in two passes.

<<*>>=
<<global variables>>
<<read the code chunks from stdin>>
<<write code chunks to stdout>>
@





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Reading the code chunks from standard input}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We are going to store every chunk into a hashtable that is indexed by
the chunk name.

<<global variables>>=
%chunks = ();
$chunkname = "";
@
%$

Our script skips everything that is not between an initial code chunk
definition of the form \verb'@<<chunk definition@>>=' and the following
\verb'@' in the first columm.

<<read the code chunks from stdin>>=
while (<>) {
    chomp; # strip off trailing newline character
    if (/^@<<(.+)@>>=\s*$/) { #chunk definition
        $chunkname = $1;
        if (! defined($chunks{$chunkname})) {$chunks{$chunkname} = []}
        next;
    }
    if (/^@/) {$chunkname = ""; next} #chunk end
    if ($chunkname eq "") {next} #skip non-code-chunk lines
    push @{$chunks{$chunkname}}, $_; #append $_ at the end of the list
}
@
%$

After executing the above code, the hash variable \verb'%chunks' %$
contains all the code chunk lines where lines that came from
chunks with identical name have already been joined.











%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Writing the code chunks to standard output}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Writing out the code is done recursively starting with the code chunk
\verb'@<<*@>>'. Since [[printCodeChunk]] does not add a final newline,
we do it afterwards explicitly and thus trigger a flushing of an
internal buffer.
 
<<write code chunks to stdout>>=
&printCodeChunk('*', '');
&printout("\n");
<<printCodeChunk>>
@

The function \verb'printCodeChunk' takes the name of the chunk and the
amount of whitespace that must be printed after each newline in a
multiline code chunk.

If \texttt{notangle} sees the use of a code chunk in a line it
replaces that with the text from that code chunk. Where a trailing
newline in the code chunk text is removed.

For single line chunk text the replacement is simple. For multiline
text, \texttt{notangle} adds spaces after a newline so that the chunk
is basically shifted as a whole.

If the first \verb'<' of the code chunk use starts in column $n$ and
the corresponding code chunk represents multiple lines, then after
each newline $n$ spaces are added.

Let us take the following file, which we name \file{example.nw}.
<<example.nw>>=
@<<*@>>=
Text1
     @<<C1@>>@<<C1@>>Text2
      Text3
@@
@<<C1@>>=
TextC11
    @<<C2@>>@<<C2@>>
TextC12
@@
@<<C2@>>=
TextC21
TextC22
@@
@

Running
\begin{verbatim}
notangle example.nw > ex.1
\end{verbatim}
yields the following output.
\begin{verbatim*}
Text1
     TextC11
         TextC21
         TextC22TextC21
               TextC22
     TextC12TextC11
               TextC21
               TextC22TextC21
                     TextC22
           TextC12Text2
      Text3
\end{verbatim*}

For a Makefile one usually adds the command line switch \verb'-t8'.
The command
\begin{verbatim}
notangle -t8 example.nw > ex.2
\end{verbatim}
yields the following text, where we have replaced tabulator characters
by arrows in order to show them here. (Note that there appears
\emph{no} tabulator character in the third line.
\begin{verbatim*}
Text1
     TextC11
         TextC21
|------> TextC22TextC21
|------>       TextC22
     TextC12TextC11
|------>       TextC21
|------>       TextC22TextC21
|------>|------>     TextC22
|------>   TextC12Text2
      Text3
\end{verbatim*}

Our program behaves differently. Instead of adding a fixed amount of
spaces \texttt{rhxtangle} concatenates initial whitespace that appears
in the input line and only adds spaces to account for positioning
the second use of \verb'@<<C1@>>' in the file \file{example.nw}.

Executing
\begin{verbatim}
perl rhxtangle.pl example.nw > ex.3
\end{verbatim}
results in a file that is identical to \file{ex.1}.


In the function [[printCodeChunk]] we use an auxiliary function
[[printout]] which delays the actual output and removes the escape
character \verb'@' and trainling spaces.

<<printCodeChunk>>=
<<printout>>
@


The function [[printCodeChunk]] is called recursively for each use of
a code chunk inside a line.
<<printCodeChunk>>=
sub printCodeChunk {
    my($chunkname, $indentation) = @_;
    my($nextIndentation, $chars, $rest) = ($indentation, "", "");
    my($chunkNameUse) = ("");
    my(@lines, $line);
    if (! defined($chunks{$chunkname})) {
        print STDOUT "\nrhxtangle: Undefined chunkname @<<$chunkname@>>\n";
        die "rhxtangle: Undefined chunkname @<<$chunkname@>>\n";
    }
    @lines = @{$chunks{$chunkname}};
    if (scalar(@lines) == 0) {return}

    <<handle first of the @lines array and prepare for next>>

    while (scalar(@lines) > 0) { #more than one line left
        &printout("$line\n$indentation"); #print leftover from last round
        <<handle first of the @lines array and prepare for next>>
    }
    &printout($line); #print leftover from last round
}
@ %def printCodeChunk
%$
Note that there is no newline printed at the end of [[printCodeChunk]].


The following code chunk treats exactly one input line.
It scans for code chunk uses and replaces them by the corresponding
text by recursively calling the function [[printCodeChunk]].

<<handle first of the @lines array and prepare for next>>=
$line = shift @lines;
$nextIndentation = $indentation;
while ($line =~ /^(.*?)(.)?@<<(.*?[^@])@>>(.*)/) {

The [[printout]] function first buffers strings that it gets as input
until a newline character is detected. The newline character triggers
the actual output.

Before the line is actually written to standard output, trailing
whitespace are removed and escaped sequences are resolved.

Testing \texttt{rhxtangle} basically means to compare its output with
the output of \texttt{notangle}. There should be only spacing
differences for relevant files.
So we produce below a short script that could be extracted via
\begin{verbatim}
notangle -Rrhxtangletest.pl rhxtangle.pl.pamphlet > rhxtangletest.pl
\end{verbatim}
and run via
\begin{verbatim}
perl rhxtangletest.pl
\end{verbatim}

That program lists relevant files and compares the output with that
ouf \texttt{notangle}.

In fact, if the function [[tab2spc]] is applied in the function
[[printout]] before actually writing to stdout, the script
\texttt{rhxtangle} would be closer to \texttt{notangle} called without
the option \verb'-t8'.

We believe however that \texttt{rhxtangle} is good enough as a ``poor
man's replacement for \texttt{notangle}''.

<<rhxtangletest.pl>>=
<<tab2spc>>
@files=`find . -name '*.pamphlet'`;

for $f (@files) {
    chomp $f;
    $f =~ s/\.pamphlet$//;
    if ($f =~ /\.bib$/) {next}
    #print ":: $f\n";
    if ($f =~ /Makefile/) {$opt="-t8"} else {$opt=''}
    @no = `notangle $opt     $f.pamphlet`;
    @rh = `perl rhxtangle.pl $f.pamphlet`;
    if (scalar(@no) != scalar(@rh)) {
        print "Different number of lines. [$f]\n";
    }
    while (scalar(@no) > 0) {
	$n = shift @no; $n =~ s/\s*$//;
        $r = shift @rh; $r =~ s/\s*$//;
	if ($n ne $r) {
            $nn = &tab2spc($n); $n =~ s/[\t]/_/g;
            $rr = &tab2spc($r); $r =~ s/[\t]/_/g;

In order to remove the need to distribute a version of noweb with Axiom, 
we must modify the sources a bit.

I've run every .pamphlet file from silver/branches/build-improvements 
through noweb.

There are the following problems

notangle src/hyper/token.pamphlet > dummy
undefined chunk name: <<token.c>>

notangle src/doc/primesp.spad.pamphlet > dummy
The root module <<*>> was not defined.

rhx: The file src/doc/primesp.spad.pamphlet is a pure latex file. But 
the .spad extension is quite misleading.

There are more files under src/doc that happen to have no <<*>> chunk, 
but the above .spad file looks most strange.

Are you familiar with itex2mml?  It uses lex/yacc so ultimately it's a C
program.  I have an adaptation in python that I haven't released...

Do you have something working that displays axiom in firefox?

I think ultimately it's a better idea to get axiom to output mathml
directly, rather than insert yet-another translation layer (and
therefore, another layer of confusion and bugs) between the program and
the user.

How do you intend this to used WRT axiom?  Also remember that as the
author you're free to change the license later.  (But old versions will
still fall under old licenses...)  If you start accepting patches from
other people, it becomes difficult to change the license because
contributors generally contribute with an understanding of the current
license, and you'd have to get their permission to change licenses.

That's a pretty neat idea.

Too many things calling for their attention at the same time.

That just means that people want to try Axiom out than add anything to
the wiki.

Well, then, I'm wrong.  It would discourage me, but perhaps the

Okay, but according to your numbers, it isn't very important.

If I want to try out a command line program (like Axiom), I'd like to
just enter a command and see what happens, rather than edit a wiki.
But I guess that's just me.

Yes, but you seem to be in charge of the community effort.  So let me

Hello,

About the example on the front page. It is astehetic but the type result is
almost the equivalent to any.

I do not have super good replament idea.
But I will proprose some Taylor expansion maybe ?

Antoine Hersen

Hi,

  The patch below takes a step further in dealing with X11 header
files and archive locations.  As I mentioned earlier, the solution is
to delegate this delicate problem to Autoconf.  Indeed, Autoconf comes
with a macro (AC_PATH_XTRA) that does quite extensive and elaborate
tests to figure out which -I, -L, and -l flags are needed to compiler
and link a program using X11.  If you believe that this problem can be
easily dealt with by special-casing makefiles, have a look at the
configure file generated by Autoconf -- that should give you an idea
of the extent of the variabilities.

  Concretely, this patch takes care of the build failure I reported
here 

   http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-07/msg00242.html

I complete a successful build on that machine.  I suspect this cures
the problems on many other platforms that are not special-cased in the
top-level Makefiles.  I suspect I also break builds on some other
machines, so you can test, please give it a try.  Check out the
build-improvements branch, configure, and make.


  There remains the issue of Xpm.  That library is very curious.  It
had been deprecated, replaced with xpm-nox, resurrected, and still not
widely supported.  A long term fix in Axiom is to move away from it
(no, don't think about including a copy of it in Axiom!).  A
short-term fix may be of:

   (1) abort configuration if Xpm is missing -- not my favour
   (2) don't build parts of Axiom that uses Xpm, if it is missing.
   (3) do (2), but allow users to specify Xpm locations.
   (4) do (3), but include configure test to detect it -- sounds nice.

I'm including toward (4) but I don't have time to implement it right now.

Generated files are not included in the patch.

+One of the thorniest issues with programs that use the X Window System
+is portability.  There exist many implementations of the X11
+specification, each with its own variations, extensions, and what
+not.  Designing hand-written, makefiles for such programs can be a
+daunting task, fraut with all kinds of traps.  Fortunately, Autoconf
+provides us with some help, namely the macro [[AC_PATH_X]] and 
+[[AC_PATH_XTRA]].  The former searches the directories where the
+include files and the libraries file for X11 reside.  The later is an
+enhanced version that:
+\begin{itemize}
+\item computes the C compiler flags required by X;
+\item computes the linker flags required by X;
+\item checks for special libraries that some systems need in order to
+   compile X programs;
+\item checks for special X11R6 libraries that need to be linked before
+  the flag [[-lX11]].
+\end{itemize}
+
+<<locate X11>>=
+AC_PATH_XTRA
+## Output directives for the C compiler
+AC_SUBST(X_CLFAGS)
+## Output directives for the linker
+AC_SUBST(X_LIBS)
+## Output any extra libraries required by X11
+AC_SUBST(X_EXTRA_LIBS)
+
+## Finally, output the list of libraries that need to appear before -lX11
+## Some part of Axiom depends on Xpm.  That library has kind uncertain
+## future.  At some point in the past, it was deprecated, to be
+## replaced by xpm-nox; then came back again.  So, its support may
+## vary from system to system.  For the moment, we assume that if X11
+## is found then, Xpm is already present.  Though, clearly that is a
+## very optimistic assumption.  Long term, Axiom should get rid of
+## dependence on Xpm.  A nearly fool-proof test would be probably
+## inspired by AC_PATH_XTRA.  I don't have time to get to that 
+## complication right now.  Will fix later.

We no longer need the generated toplevel Makefile.  All makefiles are
now generated at configure or build time.  But, we are still far from
a simple build machinery.

Tested on an i686-pc-linux-gnu

This is a reply from the SAGE people. 

I think we can profitably work together to get an interesting user
interface. Bill Page's work on integrating the wiki with inline
pamphlets and inline algebra from multiple systems is surely of
interest. Jose's Doyen work would also be of interest.

I've also attached my note to Jose related to work I've been doing
on the Doyen effort to make it possible to drag-and-drop literate
programs onto a local wiki.

Anyone interested should contact SAGE directly and copy the mailing
list. I'll be away for the next week.

Tim

What happened with the axiomui project, is axiom capable of serving its
interface over HTTP?  (or, any connection which can be convinced to be
non-blocking?)

Cool.

I'm eager to see this kind of work proceeding, though I'm basically too
busy to do much myself.  :(

You might take a look at tiddlywiki with my jsmath plugin:
http://bob.mcelrath.org/tiddlyjsmath-2.0.3.html which is a fairly
complex javascript application.  When I put together firefox with axiom,
I used an older version of tiddlywiki.  jsMath is okay for the time
being, but too slow for a serious math interface.  An XHTML plugin for
it was posted last week:
    http://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de/#XHTML10Plugin

If you have a C tex->mathml converter, have you investigated making a
C++ firefox extension with it?

Attached is the web-based axiom interface I created.  You should just be
able to run ./fifo-axiom on a linux system.  (you need firefox
installed)  Perhaps it will give you some ideas...

Perhaps the SAGE people would like to look at this too...

    Only after you've tried to figure something out for yourself and
    failed are you ready to absorb "the answer."

I apologize for starting in the middle of this exchange. I wasn't
able to retrieve any archived messages from this thread in the
SourceForge archive, so I hope you will forgive that some of my
questions have already been addressed.

By "tighter integration" are you referring to converting to and
from Axiom data structures and Sage data structures and therefore
allowing the results of calculations from one system to be
translated and used in another? As you might know, Axiom is
quite distinct from most other computer algebra systems in the
extent to which it employs strong typing and an object-orientation.
Do you think that therefore such "tight integration" might present
more problems with Axiom and Sage compared to, say the existing
Maxima-Sage interface?

I am very glad to hear confirmation of interest in concept of using
a wiki for integrated collaborative development of mathematical
software. This is something that we have been trying to do for some
time now in Axiom. I am still a strong believer in this idea even
though I have to admit that we have not yet been very successful in
establishing any serious and long term projects of this nature that
depend critically on the Axiom Wiki.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

I would be very interested to hear more about your plans for "our
new wiki". I recall that parts of Sage are written in Python and
depends on Zope. The Axiom Wiki is uses the Zwiki Zope product with
extensions to provide LaTeX support and interfaces to Axiom and
Reduce. As Tim has mentioned we have also developed a new page
type for ZWiki which implements some of the components of a
literate programming environment for Axiom. At the present time
all of the Axiom source code is accessible (and editable) in this
environment but we have not yet completed the direct integration of
this wiki interface with the rest of the Axiom build environment.

So I am very interested to hear your ideas about how this sort
of thing should work.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi,

  The current toplevel makefile uses the variable INSTALL to designate
the prefix of the installation directory.  That usage does not seem
common; at least, it clashes with the classical meaning of INSTALL in
the Autotools world (it holds the name of the 'install' program, or
equivalent).  This patch changes that to DESTDIR, which is the
conventional name.

Tested on an i686-pc-linux-gnu.

The kind of thing I had in mind should appear non-trivial. (I admit
the current example could be considered nearly trivial.) It should
be largely self-explanatory. And it should generate some nicely
formatted LaTeX output but not too much output. In short, designed
to impress. Integration results often seem to quality.

I don't worry too much about the type of the result but the fact
that Axiom's results are typed is certainly worth illustrating.

Of course Axiom can do a lot more than just integration. I think
it would be great to have more suggestions and examples of
favourite Axiom calculations that Axiom users would like to see
on the FrontPage. Send your examples and I will see if I can find
a way to select them at random. 

Regards,
Bill Page.

I must have missed something. Why do you think there is a need
to distribute noweb with Axiom? From my point of view noweb is
just a dependency like several other packages required to build
axiom.

Well, that

notangle src/hyper/token.pamphlet > dummy
undefined chunk name: <<token.c>>

error occurs if you run "original" notangle on token.pamphlet. So either 
my Silver/build-improvement version uses its own (modified) notangle or 
notangle is never called on that file.

But I've now run (axiom--main--1)

mnt/linux/bin/lib/notangle src/hyper/token.pamphlet 

echo $?

and got error code 2.

So the question is actually not about a dependency on noweb but it shows 
a bug in a Makefile. Why is that error ignored? Or is token.c never 
generated? The latter seems to be the case. So what do we need 
token.pamphlet for?

'token.pamphlet' contains token.h, so yes it is needed.

When I run

mnt/linux/bin/lib/notangle src/hyper/token.pamphlet

I get:

...
*/

ignoring undefined chunk name: <<token.c>>
<<token.c>>

------

This message is a result of Tim's patch to noweb (which should
be handled via a simple awk filter instead of a patch to the
noweb source).

But from other examples of Tim Daly's usual coding practice in the
Makefiles I believe that notangle is never called that way with this
file. It is acutally used this way:

$ mnt/linux/bin/lib/notangle -R'token.h' src/hyper/token.pamphlet

with a specified 'root' to extract just the header file. See:

$ cd src/hyper
$ grep token.h *.pamphlet
hyper.pamphlet:#include "token.h"
Makefile.pamphlet:        ${MID}/titlebar.h ${MID}/token.h
Makefile.pamphlet:${MID}/token.h: ${IN}/token.pamphlet
Makefile.pamphlet:      @ echo 139 making ${MID}/token.h from
${IN}/token.pamphlet
Makefile.pamphlet:      @ (cd ${MID} ; ${TANGLE} -R"token.h"
${IN}/token.pamphlet >token.h )
token.pamphlet:\section{token.h}
token.pamphlet:<<token.h>>=

--------

BTW, I am still curious about "my Silver/build-improvement version".
Is this a new version of noweb?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thank you very much for sending the patches. I have not applied
these patches to any of the Axiom distributions yet however I
did take the opportunity to update the online versions of these
documents on the Axiom Wiki from the Axiom Silver distribution and
then I applied your patches there. If you wish you can continue to
make your proposed changes to this online version. This would
allow the changes to be quickly reviewed by other Axiom users and
developers.

I would like to ask the other Axiom Developers for their opinion
about how best to handle these sort of changes to documentation in
the Axiom source distribution: Should we accumulate and review the
changes online and only then apply a cumulative patch to Silver
and Gold?

See revised online version:

I consider this a completely acceptable policy and I would like
to encourage you (and others) to continue to make these changes.
As the saying goes: Be Bold! You contributions will be greatly
appreciated by all.

I would very much like that there is only ONE version, namely 
axiom--test--1 editable through the wiki and that version is always in 
sync with a branch (call it silver/branches/axiom--test--1) on our 
subversion repository. Is that sync'ing easily achievable?

I don't like very much that there is a separate (completely different 
looking branch book--main--1). I guess that makes the axiom sources even 
more a mess than they are in axiom--main--1.

Reduce the number of different repositories!

Ralf

I rather dislike these weird "arch" names. Perhaps we can define
a new branch in Silver specifically for this purpose? On the other
hand having too many branches seems like the same kind of "trap"
that we got into with arch - defining branches and then no one
shows up to maintain them and no one bothers to merge them etc.
Maybe we should just sync the Silver main branch.

> Is that sync'ing easily achievable?

Yes. We could automatically do an 'svn update' every evening.
I have been thinking about how best to view the online wiki
version of the source and documentation. I believe that it
should be treated in much the same way as one would treat one's
own local copy of a repository. The only difference here is
that this online version might be edited in a collaborative
fashion. We should not think of it as "yet another repository"
but rather just the online collaborative shared version of
one of the main repositories. Using 'svn update' can be automatic
but I think we might need to take more care with 'svn commit'.
Should we limit commits to only one file at a time?

Another alternative that I have been thinking about is only
supporting a "diff and patch" interface for the online wiki
version of the source and documentation. This would mean adding
two new options to the pamphlet thumbnail menu. Clicking on
'diff' would ask you to upload an 'original' file and then
perform a 'diff -au' against that file. The output would be
presented in the browser and could be saved as a patch file.
Clicking on 'patch' would ask you to upload a patch file and
then attempt to apply that patch to the online pamphlet source.

This "diff and patch" interface would keep the online source
and documentation pamphlets independent of the choice of underlying
repository software, but synching and committing would then be
a more manual process.

I am not sure yet which model I prefer.

I think originally Tim had in mind that there might be people
who only wished to work on the Axiom documentation. Note there
are some files in book--main--1 that are not in any other
branch, e.g. bookvol2.pamphlet etc. I still inclined to agree
that the "large" documentation with no direct connection to
the source pamphlets should be separable. Rather than what
you suggest, I would be in favour of moving bookvol1.pamphlet
out of the Silver source distribution and into it's own svn
repository.

I agree! My personal opinion is still that svn is a poor choice:
I would rate it only slightly above cvs and below arch. And I
rate darcs as much better than both. I still have a lot of
trouble getting svn to work properly on windows. (darcs works
fine on windows.) But in the interests of easing cooperation and
collaboration I think we need to compromise and standardize on
svn.

In fact I think we should drop the entire arch (tla) archive.
Now that we have Silver, I don't see that the arch version has
any real purpose.

I've grepped the silver/branches/build-improvements branch for the word 
'notangle'.

grep -l -R 'notangle' * |grep -v 'svn-base'

The following files contain explicit reference to 'notangle'
build-setup.sh
   reference to notangle will go away in the near future...

Makefile.pamphlet
   sets the variables TANGLE/WEAVE (that should be OK)
   TANGLE=${SPADBIN}/lib/notangle
   WEAVE=${SPADBIN}/lib/noweave

src/scripts/document
   Uses noweb by setting the following variables.
   tangle=$AXIOM/bin/lib/notangle
   weave=$AXIOM/bin/lib/noweave

src/algebra/Lattice.pamphlet
   MANY lines like
   ${SPADBIN}/notangle -R"domain XPR XPolynomialRing" \
      ${IN}/xpoly.spad.pamphlet >XPR.spad
   appear here.


The 'src/scripts/document' should get the TANGLE and WEAVE variables 
from Makefile.pamphlet or the configure script. Gaby, is the latter 
possible?

The file src/algebra/Lattice.pamphlet is just 1.7 MB and about 45,000 
lines. My emacs dies when it automatically tries to font-lock that file. :-(

Anyway, I believe quite a lot of the Makefile code in there could be 
made much shorter. In particular, lines like the one above could be 
generated by looking into ${IN}/xpoly.spad.pamphlet.

 >perl -n -e 'if 
(/^<<(domain|category|package)\s+([^\s]+)\s+([^\s]+)>>=\s*$/){print 
"[$1] ($2) <$3>\n"}' src/algebra/xpoly.spad.pamphlet

(that is just ONE line and it produces...)

[domain] (OFMONOID) <OrderedFreeMonoid>
[category] (FMCAT) <FreeModuleCat>
[domain] (FM1) <FreeModule1>
[category] (XALG) <XAlgebra>
[category] (XFALG) <XFreeAlgebra>
[category] (XPOLYC) <XPolynomialsCat>
[domain] (XPR) <XPolynomialRing>
[domain] (XDPOLY) <XDistributedPolynomial>
[domain] (XRPOLY) <XRecursivePolynomial>
[domain] (XPOLY) <XPolynomial>

In Lattice.pamphlet we find ...
cd ${MID};${SPADBIN}/notangle ${IN}/xpoly.spad.pamphlet >xpoly.spad
cp ${MID}/FMCAT.NRLIB/code.o ${OUT}/FMCAT.o
cd ${MID} ;  echo ')co FMCAT.spad' | ${INTERPSYS}
${SPADBIN}/notangle -R"category FMCAT FreeModuleCat"
     ${IN}/xpoly.spad.pamphlet >FMCAT.spad
cp ${MID}/FM1.NRLIB/code.o ${OUT}/FM1.o
cd ${MID} ;  echo ')co FM1.spad' | ${INTERPSYS}
${SPADBIN}/notangle -R"domain FM1 FreeModule1" ${IN}/xpoly.spad.pamphlet
     >FM1.spad

etc.

I am quite sure that all the hundreds of targets in Lattice.pamphlet 
follow exactly the same pattern. Shouldn't we have a short program that 
replaces 40,000 Makefile lines???

Ralf

No problem, but the branch on the SVN repository and the name you put
onto the website should be identical.

Yes, exactly.

Hmmm, I would say that what now is axiom--test--1 should just become

silver/branches/axiom--test--1

or whatever name you like to give it. And it should live on Sourceforge
and on the wiki with identical data. The Wiki could be freely updated by
everyone (maybe some registration would be useful, so we would know whom
to contact if we like or dislike a modification). Then we (ax-dev
mailing list) have about one (or two?) month to give
opinions/testresults etc. If there is no serious problem then the
modifications can be merged with silver/trunk.

I strongly believe that axiom--main--1 should be a "testing" branch and
things from their should only enter the silver/trunk if they do not
break anything serious. Note that silver/trunk is supposed to become Gold.

On the other hand, patches to silver/trunk should be immediately applied
to silver/branches/axiom--test--1 and thus become available on the
website. axiom--test--1 is not supposed to compile, but it should be
close to it and should be at least as hot as silver/trunk.

I believe that people should register before they can change code. Then
commiting is not a problem, you just forward the registered name (and
allow it).

> Should we limit commits to only one file at a time?

I would say so, since we might accept some changes and reject others. It
is easier to pick the stuff if you have per-file-commits. I believe that
it is a bit hard to submit changesets through the webinterface. But it
should be required to add a reason for the change and that reason should
become an svn-log.

> Another alternative that I have been thinking about is only

Maybe some people like diff and patch, I don't. I am not a computer and
have problems in reading the diffs. It is simply not natural for a human.

Hmmm, that is strange. Axiom should become just one big documentation
(all is literate). Seems like the book stuff is a project that is
"about" Axiom but not Axiom itself similar to "The TeXbook" and
"TeX---The Program". If that was the intension? Then I could understand
the splitting, but I still believe that we should have everything in
just one repository. If I come to the Axiom project I would not like to
learn after some weeks of studying the sources that the Axiom-Book is
actually another project and doesn't live in axiom--main--1.

>> Reduce the number of different repositories!

Yes, yes. And I also believed that arch is better than svn (and still
do), but Gaby is right in the sense that we must lower the barrier for
new people. That is more important than a non-perfect SCM.

> I still have a lot of trouble getting svn to work properly on
> windows.

That is not my main concern. I rather think that the missing starmerge
is a problem. SVK should overcome that, but I have not yet tested it
properly.

> But in the interests of easing cooperation and collaboration I think
> we need to compromise and standardize on svn.

Yes. Let's for the moment concentrate on svn/svk. If the SCM becomes a 
problem we can switch later.

> In fact I think we should drop the entire arch (tla) archive.

We can. It is as simple as this: remove any reference to any other 
repository than axiom--main--1 from 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources. If nobody knows about 
these archives, they are gone.

But we should ask Tim about it and, in fact, I believe, now that we have 
the AxiomSources page, they don't hurt that much. What I would actually 
like to see is how much alive a branch is. But maybe that is asking for 
too much. Is it possible to see branch activities on sourceforge without 
actually downloading the branch?

I'm for that.  If the silver branch is supposed to be the "live"
source, then I see no reason to branch from different places.

I hope to have enough cleanup on build-improvements, so that we can
merge part  of the work there.

Yes, it is ridiculously huge. The same is true of several other
Makefiles. I argued with Tim Daly over this. He claimed that the
regular structure of these "dirt simple" files makes them easy
to maintain and he adamantly resisted any sort of more sophisticated
gnu make methods that would make the files much shorter. I still do
not accept this view. I think shorter is (almost) always better even
if it means you have to learn a little more about the tools you are
using.

This is similar to the awk scripts that I wrote for
src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet take a look at the chunks

<<findSpadFiles>>
<<findBootstrapFiles>>

Yes! Before I finally got Tim to accept my change to
src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet it was similar in size and as far
as I was concerned it was unmaintainable.

A minor point: Should we assume 'perl' as a build dependency? I
only assumed 'awk' - which one might view as an older and simpler
version of 'perl'. But I am not against assuming the presence of
'perl' and getting rid of the old 'awk' scripts.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Can we get rid of the weird double dashes?

Hmm, PERL is certainly not installed on every machine, but I now write 
all my scripts in perl simply because I cannot remember all those 
different variants of sh, ksh, csh, zsh, etc and awk, nawk, oawk, mawk.
It is quite human to make error with that.

I am all in favour of PERL. It is quite common nowadays anyway. And for 
our simple usage we probably don't need any fancy perl module.

That's my 1 1/2 cents. ;-)

The current build machinery installs spad files generated from
pamphlet files.  Do we need that?

I presume that Gaby is talking about the spad source files
contained in

   mnt/linux/src/algebra

These files are created by notangle of the root <<*>> from
all of the *.spad.pamphlet files.

Yes, in principle these files are needed. They are the "source"
files referred to by the ')sh' command and in hyperdoc. But
there is currently a problem with accessing these files and
also a conceptual problem of how to handle the editing of
these files since for that purpose they have been replaced
by .pamphlet files.

See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/144

and

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/116

I may have to take back what I said ealier about noweb not
being a required part of the run-time environment if we decide
that we want to maintain this "edit source" feature.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I'm going to assume that, for the moment, noweb is just a build
utility, not intended to be installed with Axiom.

We can revise that decision later. 
I'm trying to simplify/rationalize the Makefiles and the build machinery.

This is a failure during the sub-build of GCL but the cause is

These options for the gcl build are different from the

I previously reported the message "NULL_OR_ON_C_STACK macro invalid"
to Camm MacQuire when using the --enable-maxpage=3D256*1024 option
on this system but he was not able to suggest a solution. The
suspicion is that this has something to do with memory management
on a linux virtual host.

I will repeat the build using --enable-maxpage=3D128*1024. Maybe we
need a way to conveniently pass build options through ./configure
to the gcl ./configure?

If you like I can send you the full build log or other intermediate

Camm,

I have encountered the error message:

  NULL_OR_ON_C_STACK macro invalid

again while building gcl-2.6.8pre (contain in the current Axiom
distribution), on the axiom-developer.org shared virtual server
with option --enable-maxpage=3D256*1024. As before, the build of
gcl and of Axiom completes normally if I change the gclopts to
--enable-maxpage=3D128*1024. Tim did say that he was going to
revert to the smaller value

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-10/msg00392.html

but the current build still uses 256*1024.

I am wondering whether anything in the forth coming gcl-2.7
might help to eliminate this problem? Did you manage to "relax the
power of two constraint"?

-------

We are currently using linux kernel 2.6.16.14. Could you explain
what you mean by "the issue should be addressable"? How could I
go about addressing it, given that this is a share virtual server?

I was wondering if it might be possible to change the
NULL_OR_ON_C_STACK macro to be something like that proposed by
Mike Thomas for Windows:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gcl-devel/2005-12/msg00091.html

Actually, it seems that for Axiom we often do need more memory.
Anything you can suggest here would be appreciated.

Regards,
Bill Page.

   [21:30]% cat axiom.silver/src/scripts/boxup
   cp /usr/local/bin/boxhead $1.pamphlet
   cat $1 >>$1.pamphlet
   cat /usr/local/bin/boxtail >>$1.pamphlet
   mv $1 $1.org
   document $1
   echo diffing $1 $1.org
   diff $1 $1.org
   rm -f $1.dvi
   echo if files do not differ it is safe to rm $1 $1.org

Given the current makefiles, there is no way a "normal" install of
Axiom will put the files named boxhead and boxtail in /usr/local/bin.
I must therefore assume that that script has not been run recently.
Furthemore, boxhead and boxtail really are not scripts; there are
LaTeX fragments.  Their logical directory should be something like a
"share" directory.

I'll implement that -- unless people believe that boxup and friends
may just disappear...

I think they should disappear. This is just a way of making
a template *.spad.pamphlet file from a *.spad file. They seem
completely obsolete to me.

OK.  I'm in the middle of implementing the convervative solution.  
I'll go with your suggestion.

Axiom Developers;

After being inspired by the Sage code for their interface to
Maxima, I (finally!) got around to implementing a simple
interface for Maxima on Axiom Wiki and the Axiom Portal.
See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima

This is just a first attempt. Please give it a try. Create
a few more new SandBox test pages, etc.

I would like to do better but I need some help from
knowledgeable Maxima people about how to better handle the
input and output.

Your comments and questions would be greatly appreciated.

BTW, with the help of William Stein (the primary developer
of Sage) I am also working on a similar interface between=20
MathAction and Sage. So you will soon also be able to run
Sage sessions via:

  \begin{sage}
   ...
  \end{sage}

http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage

This will provide access to several more open source
mathematics packages including GAP, Maxima, Singular,
PARI, MWRANK, NTL and others. Unlike MathAction (which
merely provides a collaborative web-based user interface),
Sage also allows you to exchange many computer algebra
data structures (e.g. polynomials) between these packages.

Currently Sage is running on the axiom-developer.org server
but we still have some problems with clisp and Maxima. clisp
refuses to run on this server - always returning an "out of
memory error" no matter what I try. William Stein explained
how to install Sage with Maxima built with GCL - which works
fine on this server, however there are now a few interface
problems between Sage and Maxima that may be due to the
different lisp platform. I expect we (William at least :)
can resolve this fairly easily.

Stay tuned.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Done.
document is longer installed.

Now, I'm on making noweb optional.  But, I understandd from various
postings that Tim added a patch to make noweb more lenient about Axiom
source files.  I'm inclined to think that is a bug in Axiom.  Could
anyone familiar with the issue makes a summary for me?

If you have a test version of Doyen with Maxima installed,
you should be able to add the new interface scripts very
easily. I will update the MathAction darcs repository later
today and you can pull it from there. I will be sure to post
the Maxima changes in a separate patch so you can pick it
separately if you wish. Note: You will also see some changes
to other files in both LatexWiki and ZWiki product directories
since my last commit. I hope applying these changes doesn't
cause you much trouble... :)

I will let you know when the repository is updated.

BTW, have you given any thought to including Sage on the
Doyen CD?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi Gaby,

I've once made a test and Bill confirmed my findings...

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-12/msg00262.html

It seems that there is only ONE line in Axiom that still needs the noweb 
  patch. I think we should simple add an @ to escape the << and get rid 
of the noweb sources.
Tim seems to want the following "non-noweb convention".

   If
   ... <<Blah>> ...
   appears in the text and the chunk name <<Blah>> is not defined,
   then noweb should output "<<Blah>>" literally.

That is not Norman Ramsey's definition, he doesn't like it and he even 
presented an awk-script that can be used as a filter to achieve that 
behaviour.

We should get rid of this convention and we should not have need for the 
awk script. I would rather tell to people that they should write 
according to noweb's definition than introducing a slight modification 
like given through the above convention. (Where should we document that 
anyway?)

Ralf

The power of two constraint remains in 2.7, hopefully for only a short
time.  Can I log in to look at this?

Well, sure! :-) You user id 'camm' still exists on the
axiom-developer.org machine. Do you need a password reset?

Thanks to this wonderful suggestion the new Maxima interface
on MathAction is looking pretty good! :)

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima

I modified the texmacs-maxima-5.9.2.lisp code a little to emit
XML-style tags instead of the TeXmacs weird control characters.
The resulting protocol is much easier to handle in Python.

So thanks to Bob and the original authors: James Amundson and
A.G. Grozin, this was a lot easier to do than I thought. :)

Please give this a try and report any problems via IssueTracker.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Great. Did you build it using GCL or Clisp?

For the time being I don't think you need any of the changes
to ZWiki. These mostly related to the new left sidebar outline
navigation which you aren't using on Doyen (at least not yet).

>=20

I have updated both the ZWiki and LatexWiki repositories
on MathAction:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MathActionRepository

I recommend that you just start with the changes in the
LatexWiki archive. These changes should be relatively safe
and should give you the Maxima interface without much
trouble.

You should also update your stylesheet file for the
definitions used by Maxima. You can get that here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/stylesheet.css

Look for the entries

#maximalabel
#maximacode
#maximaoutput
#maximainput
#maximacode pre

Let me know if you have any problems - of course there
is likely to be the usual problems with paths etc.

The changes to ZWiki have the potential to break a few things
if they are applied to a version substantially different
than what we are running on MathAction. Until/unless you want
the left sidebar thing, I think you can ignore these changes
for now.

Finally, be aware that I have not completed recently any fully
and separate install from the darcs ZWiki and LatexWiki
repositories so I am not 100% sure they will build a working
system. Be cautious. Sorry, not enough time... as usual :(
And of course, please let me know if you find something missing
from the repository.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I'll try. But please let me know if make changes you don't like or
consider unnecessary. I welcome all constructive critic.

Hi Bill,

Are the modifications that Frithjof is going to make to 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1 also sent to the 
axiom-developer mailing list so that we all can watch?

I still don't like the diff-format. So all those mathaction mails are 
actually nearly like spam to me. (But don't care to change it, it's 
currently not so frequent anyway.) If I am interested in the topic I 
just click on the link ath the bottom of the mail. (BTW, could the

   forwarded from ...

stuff be moved to the top of the mail?)

Somehow instead of
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/HowToSubmitPatches/diff
I would like to see something like an ediff in emacs. Can that be easily 
achieved?

Ralf

Greetings!

I have a trial version there now which eliminates the power of two
constraint.  Am testing locally before committing, but you might want
to too.  The issue here, as you recall, is that your machine for some
reason is placing the stack below the 0x40000000 mark.  I could get a
build with 220000 maximum pages (which is what is in my home right
now), but this might leave a very thin C stack.  I also need to check
that C stack limiting code is working, lest your heap and your C stack
collide.

Take care,

Actually, the up-to-date book volumes are in

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1

But no the modifications to these files will not be
automatically sent to the axiom-developer list - for two
reasons:

First. The Axiom Wiki is no longer directly connected to the
axiom-developer list. The wiki used to be subscribed to
the axiom-developer list so that all postings and changes
on the wiki were distributed to all subscribers to axiom-
developer. Doing this has always been a bit controversial...
The Wiki is capable of operating like an email list without
connection to axiom-developer. Starting a few months ago
(when we had some technical problems with the Savannah email
lists) I copied all the current axiom-developer subscribers
as subscribers to the Axiom Wiki and then I disabled the
Axiom Wiki subscription to axiom-developer. Since that time,
those people who still receive notices of changes on Axiom
Wiki are receiving these because they were automatically
subscribed to Axiom Wiki at that time.

Because the axiom-developer list and Axiom Wiki are no
longer directly connected, it is possible for a subscriber
to unsubscribe and for new users to subscribe to the wiki
without changing their subscription to axiom-developer.
Just click on the 'Subscribe' link in the This Site box
at the upper right corner of FrontPage

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

Or at the right of the top menu line on other pages.

Second reason.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1

is a "sub-folder wiki" of the Axiom Wiki. This means that
although it is contained in Axiom Wiki, it has it's own subset
of wiki pages - just like a folder or subdirectory. In this
case it has one "wiki page" per pamphlet file i.e. one for
each book volume. At the present time (this feature could
change in the future), sub-folder wikis behave almost
independently of the wiki in which they are contained. In
particular sub-folder wikis do not inherit the subscriber
lists of their container.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1 is also a sub-
folder wiki. In fact it consists of several nested sub-folders
corresponding to the directory structure of the Axiom source
code distribution. Subscription to each of these sub-folders
is independent of the others.

So to receive notices of changes made by Frithjof and others
to the volumes at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1

It is necessary to click the subscribe link at the right of
the top menu line.

'diff -au' format is pretty near universal isn't it?

If it gets to be too much you can control your own subscriptions
as I described above.

This is easily changed.

Do you think the first line of the email, e.g.

  Changes http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/FrontPage/diff

should be removed? Do you like the 'diff' web page any
better than the diff content of the email? Should both
the forwarded from and diff links be at the top of the
email?

>=20

>=20

I don't know anything about ediff. Do you have some
examples?

The contents of the diff web page is generated by a
function within the Python 'differ' library module which
is quite flexible. It is possible that it might be able
to generate 'ediff' format - in that case the change
would be quite easy. But email is more limiting than
web-page or emacs the screen, so I think we have to choose
carefully.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Alfredo,

I see you are using the Clisp verision of Maxima.
I suppose that might create some minor differences.

In my experience the error message "Maxima output parse
error" is most generated if for some reason the routine
'renderMaxima' in 'maximaWrapper.py' is not able to split
the maxima output into the same number of sections as
occurred in the input. Recall that the input consists of
a series of

  batch("section1.max");
  batch("section2.max");

commands. When maxima executes these commands that result
is a series of <prompt> ... </prompt> output that serves to
delimit the output. After some experimentation I determined that
the follow regular expression worked reliably for me:

outputSplit =3D '<prompt>.*</prompt>\nbatching #p.*\n'

Maybe the output is subtley different from Clisp? I find writing
reliable Python regular expressions to be very tediouos.
Comparing your output below to this pattern:

<prompt>(\mathrm{\$\%i}1)
</prompt><latex>\mbox{\tt\red(\mathrm{\$\%o1}) \black}4</latex>

It looks like this splitting might fail because there is no \n
after </prompt>. You could try changing the regular expression
to something like this:

outputSplit =3D '<prompt>.*</prompt>\s*batching #p.*\n'

Note: the output string "batching" is apparently generated
by maxima when it processes a batch() command. The only reason
it is part of this patter is so that it can be conveniently
ignored - just some Python trickery... :)

If you could create a test.input file containing several

  batch("section1.max");
  batch("section2.max");

commands containing other maxima commands and then run

  maxima < test.input >test.output

then send me the file, I will try to help you debug this.

Bill Page.

There are various kinds of polynomials used with Groebner.
If memory serves me you can specify the order in DMP or HDMP.

Two points: 

Point 1: Lattice is not used. It is there so that we can create the
lattice of the algebra code for documentation purposes. The new sed/awk
based version does not contain that information.

Point 2: Make is a rule-based programming language. Each rule 
specifies a particular situation and then specifies the MINIMUM
amount of work necessary to rebuild the system. The rules are 
written to optimize the most frequent case. The most frequent
case is changing a file and rebuilding the system.

Perl/sed/awk scripts tend to minimize the number of places you need to 
change to modify the way the system is built. Reducing the rules
to perl scripts optimizes this, the least most frequent action and
sacrifices the most frequent case.

Bill and I had this discussion years ago. The algebra Makefile is
no longer 40k lines of rules and uses sed/awk scripts.

>=20

Thanks for looking into this.

I just grabbed 2.6.8pre from cvs into a temp directory and
created a replacement tarball for the Axiom build, thus:

  cd /home/page/temp-dir

I edited the GCLOPTS in Makefile from

to
  --enable-maxpage=3D196*1024
resulting in

  GCLOPTS=3D--enable-vssize=3D65536*2 --enable-statsysbfd \
          --enable-maxpage=3D196*1024

in the default build for Axiom Silver build-improvements branch:

  make clean
  ./configure | tee build.log
  make 2>&1 | tee -a build.log

The build proceeded much further than before - the GCL sub-build
finished without errors - yeah! But the build of Axiom failed
with the following error message quite far along into the
interpsys build phase :(

  error: conflicting types for 'MYCOMBINE'

This is not something I have seen before. This same source builds
fine with the older version of 2.6.8pre and 128*256.

Here is the tail end of the log. I can send you the rest if you
like.

Please let me know how I can help.

Hello

> Actually, the up-to-date book volumes are in

> http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1

I hope this book--main--1 and the tla archive are synchronised. 
Otherwise there will be again confusion.

And why don't other people give there opinion about whether to have two 
projects like Gold and Silver (that basically contain the sources to 
build Axiom) and that book--main--1 stuff which at the moment has 
approximately empty intersection with Gold/Silver.

I strongly opt for just ONE archive. The book project should live in the
src/doc directory of the Gold/Silver sources. Otherwise we are speaking 
about Axiom sources and exclude the Axiom book. That is completely 
counter-intuitive. Please keep/make it simple.

I am not a computer. I still believe that I am human. ;-)

No.

Well, at least it is red an green. I get the plus'es and minus'es more 
easily. But still some ediff-like page would be even better.

I would prefer it.

I don't think that ediff is a special format. I would say, it is just a 
nice way to show the differences of two files.

Just take a text file a.txt copy it to b.txt and make a few 
modifications to b.txt. Then start emacs via

emacs --eval '(ediff-files "a.txt" "b.txt")'

Or use Eclipse, add the subclipse plug-in, add some SVN repository (for 
example, silver/branches/build-improvements), check out the sources, 
then right-click on a file and go to  "Compare With"-> Revision.
(You can probably also do that with standard Eclipse and an CVS repository.)

I agree.  I'm a bit disappointed that we don't branch our

I agree too. As I explained in an earlier email, on Tuesday
I updated the 'bookvol1' and 'ComputerTutorial' pamphlets in
book--main--1 on the Axiom Wiki directly from the src/doc
directory of the Silver branch. Then I applied the patches
supplied by Frithjof Schulze. So now these files on the wiki
are ready for online editing. Later we will merge these back
to Silver and then from Silver to gold. Isn't that how it's
supposed to work?

Since I don't know the status of the tla archive, I am ignoring
it for now until Tim can say how it's contents relate to Gold
and Silver.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Alfredo,

Yes, the \$ seems to be an artifact of Clisp or of the slightly
newer version of Maxima that you are using. I don't think that
your test necessarily demonstrates that this is the cause of the
current problem but it is something that you will have to deal
with later.

The test that I would like you to do is the follows:

Set up 3 text files like this:

$ cat xxx.max
1+1;
sin(x)^2;
---

$ cat yyy.max
integrate(sin(x),x);
---

$ cat max.in
batch("xxx.max");
batch("yyy.max");
batch("xxx.max");
quit();
---

Then run maxima like this:

$ /usr/local/bin/maxima \
   -p /var/zope/Products/LatexWiki/mathaction-maxima-5.9.3.lisp \
      < max.in > max.out

(modifying the paths appropriately).

Then send me the contents of the file 'max.out'

-------

These regexp either have to match *exactly* the prompt codes
that maxima sends or else you have to very carefully choose the
parts that are variable.

In the case of the \$ sequence in your example, I think that
is more likely to affect another regexp

    maximaOutPattern =3D re.compile(
        #r'<latex>.*?black\}(.*?)</latex>'              #1 LaTeX
        r'<latex>\\mbox{\\tt\\red\(\\mathrm{\\%(i\d+)}\)
\\black}(.*?)</latex>|'   #1 #2 Input
        r'<latex>\\mbox{\\tt\\red\(\\mathrm{\\%(o\d+)}\)
\\black}(.*?)</latex>|'   #3 #4 Output
        r'stdin:((?:.(?!<latex>))*.)',  #5 Other stuff
        reConsts)

This one is in ReplaceInlineMaxima.py. It's purpose is to classify
the contents of <latex> ... </latex> tags as either "input" or
"output" and to handle error messages. Note especially the

  \\mathrm{\\%

sequence which appears to differ from your results (no \$).
When reading Python string constants remember that you may have
to escape certain characters - in this case \, so \\ really
matches on one literal \ character.

So if \$ is present you may need to write:

  \\mathrm{\\\$\\%

You end up with 3 \\\ because you need 2 \\ to represent one \
and you need also to escape the $ special character.

Getting all this right can give you a headache... :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Installing the same version might simplify things but
you probably wouldn't learn as much ;) It all depends on
your frustration budget...

> Would I have to compile from source?

Installing Maxima using GCL in the Doyen CD environment
should be dead simple since you already have Axiom installed
and running with GCL. Maxima uses the Ansi common lisp mode
of GCL but Axiom does not so you have to re-build GCL with
the option

  --anable-ansi

>From the root of your Axiom source distribution go to=20

  $ cd lsp/gcl-2.6.8pre

Then rebuild GCL like this:

  $ make clean
  $ ./configure --enable-ansi
  $ make

Installing it will put a copy in /usr/local/bin

  $ make install

Then download the sources for Maxima 5.9.3 from the Maxima
web site. Untar it and then build Maxima like this:

  $ cd ~/maxima-5.9.3
  $ ./configure --with-gcl
  $ make
  $ make install

Everything should go fine.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello,

The lsp/Makefile.pamphlet file needs a reorganisation. You can quickly
read the dvi and you'll see that nearly all code chunks that patches gcl
are in subsubsections of the section "Gnu Common Lisp 2.5.2" and that
the "gcl-version stanzas" (definition of targets) are in subsections of
this section. If you want I can reorganise it but there are two
important things: first, the silver branch is moving to autotools so
Gaby or other will probably work on it and so it's, perhaps, preferable
to reorganise it later, second, if I modify it I need to know how to
restructure it.

Greg

PS : I don't plan to add documentation, just reorganise it.

Parts of my current work touch that area, but I definitely welcome
additional brains and hands :-)  Just let me know what your plans are.

Mine is to first get Autoconf in, then gradually move to Automake.
We should also get rid of the old GCL build stanzas.
If possible, have the work on the build-improvements branch so that we
don't have too many conflict when merging.
One of the thing to do is to get rid of the direct usage of OBJ, MNT,
SYS in the make files.  We should be able to abstract over those
implementations details, have the directories defined once and used
everywhere.  In the near term, we will have the following structure in
the build directory:

    top-level-build-directory/
       build/
          scripts/
          $build                # i686-pc-linux-gnu for example
            bin/
            lib/
            share/
       target/                  # staging directory for DESTDIR
          $target               # x86_64-unknown-linux for example
             bin/
             lib/
             share/
             ...

I have a patch for "optional build of noweb"; tests are running.
Next will be to have "optional build of GCL".
Then. we will get to the monsters.

BTW, I hate to have to wait for hours watching Axioms build "serialy",
with no possibility to have "parallel" builds.  That sucks. :-(

Thakns;

Lattice.pampphlet is unimpressive.  There ought to be a way to
automate the a large part of the process.

A project might be to have the compiler output spad dependencies --
just like GCC is able to output dependencies, which greatly
facilitates the tedious part of writing Makefiles and keeping them in
sync; Automake uses it.

Where you here "years ago" when we first discussed the fact
that Axiom's build dependencies form a digraph with loops?
That makes the problem of using Automake rather more
difficult, I think - not impossible, but one would still
have to manually define a set of "bootstrap" modules which
when removed from the graph, turn it into a lattice that
can be sorted. Tim Daly did this entirely manually as part
of the initial steps in making Axiom available as open source.
Prior to that it was always necessary to have a running
version of Axiom in order to build Axiom - and that was
considered by some people contrary to the intention of making
Axiom "fully available" as open source (i.e. without also
having to distribute a binary version).

Having software find a optimal minimal set of bootstrap
modules is an interest (open?) question.

What to actually do about the circular dependencies themselves
is, perhaps a separate, but interesting subject in it's own
right.

I am very interested in you opinions on this subject because
of your background with gcc which also involves a bootstrapping
process, although I think no circular dependencies, right?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I don't expect to have Automake figure out the dependencies by itself.
However, I do expect that at some point, Axiom compiler should be able
to output the dependencies.  It may not be a simple task; but that is
the whole point!

yes; I understand that.  That must have taken him a good deal of resources.

It is an ideal.  If we can't get it 100%, we must approximate to the
point where the residual is sufficiently small and manageable.

Bootstrapping problems, by definition, involve circularities.

GCC, for example, provides a sufficiently ANSI C89-conformant compiler.
It is written in C.  Therefore we have a bootstrapping problem.
"Fortunately", there are many flavours of C.  K&R being the most
popular.  Well, you have to define which "K&R".
Consequently, GCC was written in K&R C, restricted or augmented as
appropriate.  But, the new stream of developers had ANSI C89
background, and very few knew the subtle differences between K&R and
ANSI C.  And even the experts that knew them got trapped from time to
time.  The result was hard-to-find miscompilation bugs.
Consequently, we decided to bit the bullet and require ANSI C89
bootstrapping compiler.  For the few remaining platforms (notably
some old HPUX) where the system compiler is not ANSI C89, there are
binaries people can download install.

The project I know that is close to Axiom's dilemma is the Glorious
Glasgow Haskell Compiler System (GHC).
GHC is written in Haskell and you need a Haskell compiler to bootstrap
it.  To facilitate porting to new platforms, they also problem
generated C files that people to compile with "C" to build a
boostrapping compiler.  They also distribute binaries.

Where we are now is a bit different from where Tim was four years ago.
We have to think about how to reduce the surface complexity (as would
say a friend of mine). We're not going to attract lot of people
because we try to make Axiom look complicated.  We can gain by making
it look simpler to use, simpler to understand, simpler to modify.

Good.

Super. BUT...
If I haven't read the mailing list. I wouldn't even find
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/FrontPage

If there is a reference to a source it MUST appear on the 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources page. Otherwise nobody will 
find it. I even believe that it would be enough to have axiom--test--1 
on the wiki. Cannot you merge your book--main--1 with axiom--test--1 and 
remove the wiki--book--main--1 thing? Furthermore there should be a SVN 
branch on sourceforge so that people who want to contribute to the book 
could also do this via SVN. Both the SVN branch and the wiki-axiom 
sources should be in sync. I guess that might be a bit hard, since svn 
doen't feature star-merge.

Right, but I would rather like to restrict the attribute "silver" to the 
SVN trunk. All the other branches on sourceforge are in a testing phase 
and only enter silver (=trunk) if they are at least reasonably stable. 
And they can enter it only by a request of the maintainer of the testing 
branch. (Which also means there should never be a branch that has no 
responsible person attached.)

That would be a nice feature, but even if it probably will not happen 
that often, Aldor's "extend" might complicate that process (I don't say 
it makes it impossible).

Look at the files given below.
My intention is to compile them via

--aldor         aaaf1.as;  ar rv libmyprj.al aaaf1.ao;  rm aaaf1.ao
--aldor -lmyprj aaaf2.as;  ar rv libmyprj.al aaaf2.ao;  rm aaaf2.ao
--aldor -lmyprj aaaf3.as;  ar rv libmyprj.al aaaf3.ao;  rm aaaf3.ao

Assume the compiler first gets aaaf3.as. It sees either #library or 
"extend" and gives up, since no library is existing.
So it takes aaaf2.as and delays it for the same reason.
It can, however, compile aaaf1.as. Fine. But it really has to produce 
the .ao file and the library in order to be able to go on. So it is not 
just a lightweight compilation without producing code.
Then it starts again by looking at aaaf3.as. No compilation possible, 
since the function "bar" cannot be found. Now, is this just because 
there is a spelling mistake in "bar" or because the compiler has not yet 
seen aaaf2.as? OK, the compiler delays aaaf3.as and compiles aaaf2.as 
(with which options?). That works. Again the compiler must produce code 
so that aaaf3.as can compile.

One can easily setup several more extensions and finding the 
dependencies just explodes combinatorially.

A simple workaround would be to introduce a CONVENTION. One library may 
only extend a domain once. If there is need to extend another time, then 
that should happen in another library. In this way one gets a (more or 
less) natural layered structure and the library structure becomes easier 
to understand for a human.

There already happen several "extend"s in libalgebra (distributed with 
Aldor) and it is quite hard to find your way through the sources. One 
constantly has to check what the Makefile says.

Ralf

---BEGIN aaaf1.as
#include "aldor"
define CatA: Category == with {foo: () -> ()}
Dom: with {foo: () -> ()} == add {foo(): () == {}}
---END aaaf1.as

---BEGIN aaaf2.as
#include "aldor"
#library MyPrj "myprj"
import from MyPrj
extend Dom with {bar: () -> ()} == add {bar(): () == foo()}
---END aaaf2.as

---BEGIN aaaf3.as
#include "aldor"
#library MyPrj "myprj"
import from MyPrj
extend Dom with {ans: () -> ()} == add {ans(): () == bar()}
---END aaaf3.as

Greetings!

I had to make the following modifications to 20050901 to work with the
latest 2.6.8pre:

/fix/t1/camm/debian/axiom/axiom-20050901/int/interp/hash.lisp: remove static

(clines "int mem_value(x ,i)object x;int i; { return ((short *)x)[i];}")
#+AKCL
(defentry memory-value-short(object int) (int "mem_value"))


/fix/t1/camm/debian/axiom/axiom-20050901/int/interp/cfuns.lisp: match unsigned/signed

#+(AND KCL (NOT ELF))
(Clines
"int MYCOMBINE(i,j)"
"int i,j;"
"{"
"return ( (((((unsigned int)j) & 16777215) << 6)+((unsigned int)i)) % 1073741789);"
"}"
)

/fix/t1/camm/debian/axiom/axiom-20050901/int/interp/sockio.lisp: match float/double

  (clines "extern float sock_get_float();")
  (defentry open_server (string) (int "open_server"))
  (defentry sock_get_int (int) (int "sock_get_int"))
  (defentry sock_send_int (int int) (int "sock_send_int"))
  (defentry sock_get_string_buf (int string int) (int "sock_get_string_buf"))
  (defentry sock_send_string_len (int string int) (int "sock_send_string_len"))
  (defentry sock_get_float (int) (float "sock_get_float"))


The defentry code has been enhanced to support xgcl natively.

I just did a successful build of axiom 20050901 and acl2 3.0.1 with
the same maxpage -- hope this works for you, though you might still
have a stack/heap collision problem on your machine.

Take care,

So it seems that it's no longer necessary to define functions as static,
am I wrong with this (I use functions in a library written in Fortran) ?

I haven't used fancyvrb, so I am not completely sure whether my 
reasoning is correct. But I have looked into the verbatim package. 
You'll probably believe that there are quite some tricks to recognise 
the \end{verbatim} in a stream of characters that TeX is actually 
supposed to output literally.

I bet even fancyvrb cannot correctly do a line like

b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/\use {MyCode}

You could write

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/\use {MyCode}
\end{Verbatim}

That would probably correctly expand "\use {MyCode}", but the backslash 
after / is followed by a space and thus is expanded to output a space 
character. So in the output you would probably see something like

b: Boolean := MyCode / use/<MyCode>

where I wanted

b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/<MyCode>

One must escape the first \ somehow in such a case. Doable, but it makes 
the code harder to read.

Of course you could write

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=|\{\}]
b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/|use {MyCode}
\end{Verbatim}

and it would come out nicely, but then you have to make the 
corresponding tangle command a bit smarter to recognise | as the 
character that introduces TeX commands inside that Verbatim environment.

Anyway, fancyvrb seems to be quite smart, even though it does not solve 
the problem that in the output of the above code I would like see 
"Boolean" turn into a hyperlink to the definition of Boolean. 
Fortunately, the documentation of fancyvrb refers to the listings 
package for doing such fancy "pretty printing". But I have not yet 
looked into listings more closely.

Hi,

noweb uses /dev/null as a special place where to copy Emacs mode
support file, if the user does not want to have that file installed.

Axiom believes that writing to /dev/null is immoral and should not be
allowed.  Consequently it patches noweb's src/Makefile so that it uses
$(TMP)/null.  And at the same time, Axiom uses $(TMP)/null where to
send error messages in case a command fails -- for post-morterm
analysis.  The result of this mic-mac is that after noweb is built and
"installed", the file $(TMP)/null contains noweb's elisp file intead
of log messages.  :-/

I like the idea of having a log somehwere. 
I disagree with the idea that writing to /dev/null should be banned.

(Arguably, noweb's uses of /dev/null is "interesting", but that is a
different debate.)

As of revision 93, the build-improvements branch has made noweb
optional.  That means that, if noweb is already installed on the
build machine, then Axiom will not build its own version.

More precisely, we now have a new option:

    --with-noweb (negative counterpart: --without-noweb)

--with-noweb instructs the build machinery to assume that noweb is
present on the build machine -- configure does a check and errors out
if it cannot find notangle and noweave.

Conversely, --without-noweb instructs the build machinery not to
bother checking anything and assume that noweb is absent.
Axiom's copy of noweb is built.

If you don't specify any of those two options, configure will detect
whether both notangle and noweave are present.  If yes, it will use
them.  If one of both are missing, then Axiom's copy is used.

Of course, all of that will be added to the documentation.  This is
just a "heads up".

Bill,

Maxima is working now for me. Thanks for all the help. I needed actually 3 \
characters.
One to scape \ and the other one to scape the $ sign. Now, I just need to
add the nice
formatting from stylesheet.

I have another question. At some point, I saw on the list a bug about the
image created
for pamphlet files not been updated after saving. I remember that somebody
said that it
was necessary to click on preview first. However, this is not working for
me. I would like
to know if you know how to solve this issue.

Regards,

AP

I made one simple change relating to formatting in ReplaceInlineMaxima.py
yesterday. You should also pull that change from the MathAction repository.

No. Preview doesn't have anything to do with this. It is caused because
the web server is configured to agressively cache all graphics files

But isn't /dev/null quite Unix-specific? It basically means that in 
order to build Axiom one must have a Unix-like environment. Not that I 
want to make the build process more complicated, but I am just curious 
how difficult it would be to build Axiom without mingw or cygwin.

Hi,

  Part of planning to clean up a bit the lsp/ directory, I'm removing
old GCL bits.  Old GCL here means anything prior to GCL-2.6.7.

I think that is a very good idea. I would encourage you to delete
*everything* that is not directly related to the current Axiom
build. I think we should not let the Axiom distribution collect
any cruft and we should not use it to re-distribute other packages
just because they might be a little hard to find.

I continue to be very impressed and pleased by your work on the
new Silver build_improvements branch. It cheers me up immensely. :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

I think it would be great to have interfaces to more computer
algebra systems in Doyen CD and on MathAction. I would be glad
to help with any project of this kind that you or anyone else
decide to undertake. YACAS might be a good choice. I am currently
looking at another more specialized package recently recommended
by Bertfried Fauser called Cadabra, written by Kasper Peeters

http://www.aei.mpg.de/~peekas/cadabra/

As I have said several times before, the extensions that I made
to LatexWiki to support Axiom, Reduce and most recently Maxima
are really just a simple source filter hack in two parts.

The first part is a module to "wrap" the external program (e.g.
maximaWrapper.py) which runs a complete external session containing
multiple input sections in "batch mode" and then parses the
resulting output into sections corresponding to each input section.
The second part is a module (e.g. ReplaceInlineMaxima.py) that
extracts the input sections from the raw page source, e.g.

  ...
  \begin{maxima}
  section 1 commands
  \end{maxima}
  ...
  \begin{maxima}
  section 2 commands
  \end{maxima}
  ...

contains two input sections. It calls the wrapper to run the
external session and then replaces the input sections with output
sections in the page source. The result is passed on to the next
filter.

This is a batch process that is done once for each page preview
or when the page is saved so it does not have to be particularly
efficient.

The only challenging part is parsing the session output. In the
case of Maxima this was made particularly simple by the use of the
modified TeXmacs interface. All of the rest of the work is done by
LatexWiki and Zwiki and Zope.

:) Well, thanks. But I think the Doyen CD is a pretty neat idea
too. I like how this is all coming together.

Well, I would definitely like to see the new web pages that you
created for Doyen on the new CD. For both Axiom and Maxima there
should be a few pages containing some examples and references
to other documentation. You can get these from the Axiom Wiki.
See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima

Bill Page.

Greetings all.

Bob - I'll see your scare quotes and Microsoft/Intel characterisation, and 
raise you Working Code.. ;-)

Here's where I'm at with LatexWiki and MathAction. I updated LatexWiki 0.42 
to be compatible with current Zwiki.
http://joyful.com/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=latexwiki;a=summary

Now I've copied that into the Zwiki product as an internal plugin.
http://joyful.com/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=ZWiki;a=filehistory;f=/plugins
This is running on zwiki.org at the moment.

I'm following the same process with the latest MathAction. Here it is 
updated to work with current Zwiki, at least to the point of rendering LaTeX:
http://joyful.com/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=mathaction;a=summary
I have this installed as an internal plugin but it's not as yet added to 
the Zwiki repo.

This mathaction plugin is still using it's own older version of LatexWiki. 
I haven't made any attempt to refactor it to use the newer latexwiki 
plugin, but this may be a good thing to work towards. And that looks a lot 
easier now. In the past I tried to reconcile the two by pulling patches 
between your repos, but the differences were too large for me to resolve.

About internal vs. external plugins - a lot of projects seem to end up 
organised this way: many independent plugins, but distributed en masse. At 
the cost of some independence, it ensures users always have compatible 
code, solving a whole lot of problems with version skew and backwards 
compatibility, and also makes the overall codebase more maintainable and 
likely to be kept up to date. I think it's a good approach for zwiki 
plugins and pagetypes.

Should I bundle a mathaction plugin with Zwiki ? I'm not sure yet. I might 
check it in, refactor it and split it out again later. Anyway, ideally I'll 
achieve a clean up-to-date mathaction that's enticing enough for Bill to 
switch to. If not, well nothing lost.

Comments welcome - Simon

There are still some patches against GCL that Tim developed.
Ideally, I think we should not be in the business of patching GCL.
Camm has been collaborating with us very effectively; we should

OK, so no need to reorganise the Makefile.pamphlet, cool :-)

I think all of the patches made by Tim are obsolete. I agree
that we should not be in the business of patching GCL. Although
GCL is currently the primary vehicle for delivering Axiom, it
is not the only Lisp that is capable of doing so. (For example
there is the open source CMUCL version of Axiom done by Jurgen
Weiss and the commercial version of Axiom used yet another lisp
and that lisp is now open source too.

In fact I am fairly sure that Camm has already addressed all of
the GCL issues that have been identified so far. None of these
patches are used in the Debian release of Axiom which is built
from an unmodified standard distribution of GCL. There is no
reason that I can think of way this should not become the standard
way of building Axiom from GCL on all platforms (including Windows).

Regards,
Bill Page.

For GCL-2.6.7, Tim has a patch against configure.in.  The reason being
that:

   There is a typo in configure.in that is only detected under some
   versions of bash. The problem is a missing single-quote mark.

For that to work correctly, there is an implicit assumption that the
user's build environment has Autoconf -- to regenerate configure from
the patched configure.in.  I don't how serious that is.  Anyway, it
GCL-2.6.7 that we might just abandon from the silver branch.

For GCL-2.6.8pre we have four patches:

  * gcl-2.6.8pre.socket.patch
  * gcl-2.6.8pre.libspad.patch
  * gcl-2.6.8pre.toploop.patch
  * gcl-2.6.8pre.collectfn.fix

Can you check with Camm that they are indeed not needed anymore?  I'm
sorry, I don't fully understand the issues they are trying to address.

Ack ... Lisp wars! :) Well ...

1. As far as I know, GCL and CLISP are the only open source Lisps that 
run on Windows. CMUCL for sure doesn't and SBCL may not either. CMUCL 
probably never will, but SBCL has a good chance.

2. I think GCL is faster than CLISP.

3. If you have GCL installed, does Axiom still build its own copy, or 
does it know about the installed version?

I did that, and made more changes, and it's running reasonably well now at 
zwiki.org. See http://zwiki.org/MathActionTests (and subtopics).

This means you can check out the latest Zwiki and get latex, axiom, reduce, 
maxima, & pamphlets up and running without too much pain, at least on my 
debian system. All helper programs are assumed to be in /usr/bin, axiom.sty 
should be copied to /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/ (and mktexlsr should 
be run).

All: I learned about and played with a lot of cool stuff today. Thanks for 
all this great work!

You can convince Axiom to use the installed GCL by defining the
variable GCLVERSION=gcl-system -- this is what FreeBSD folks do,
according to the documentation.

I'm working on a patch that have Axiom autodetect GCL and use it.

I believe ECL also works on Windows, but I don't know too much about it beyond 
that.

Yes, this is what I have heard as well.  (Indeed, new-clx on clisp was written
specificly to solve performance issues that the usual clx has, IIRC.)

SBCL has made strides on Windows, but keep in mind some issues are EXTREMELY 
difficult to handle in porting and it will likely be a very long time before 
sbcl is full featured on both Linux and Windows.

For a quick summary of platforms supported by sbcl, there is this page:
http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/platform-table.html

These are the to-do lists I am aware of for the sbcl port:
http://www.dridus.com/~nyef/TODO.Win32

Well, I'm not a TeXnician, nor a LaTeX expert.  I just find the

alternatives I've tried.  Given the sort of things it does, I thought
it might have faced similar issues, but again I'm not a LaTeX expert.

  As of revision 96, if you're in the middle of development, you

I tried the binary and found it didn't work on Gentoo, so it was back
to building from source.  I got most of the way there with a gold
branch cvs checkout (I think it's fairly recent) and started up the
aldor part of the build.  This was the error:

There is a list of available lisps here:

http://www.cliki.net/Common Lisp implementation

Thus, we should also target 

Armed Bear Lisp - Armed Bear Common Lisp is a Common Lisp implementation that
runs on a Java Virtual Machine

and

PowerLisp - PowerLisp is a free Common Lisp implementation for the Macintosh

Maybe the latter would bring us on the Mac faster, which would cheer up Antoine
considerably, I guess.

What concerns speed, I think this depends very much on the application. I don't
think it's fair to say that gcl is faster than clisp. This is very likely an
oversimplification.

Yes I faced the same problem, I commented out (dirty hack) the "@false",
ligne 68 of src/aldor/libaxiom.mk :

$(MID)/as/attrib.as:: $(INT)/algebra/ATTREG.spad
        @echo "Please add new attributes to $(Ax0Dir)/attrib.as.head"
#       @false

You can probably "touch" src/aldor/as/attrib.as.head as well. See

I recently did a complete end-to-end build of Axiom Silver on Gentoo. It 
worked fine.

I have GCL installed, and I'm just about to try using that for the build.

By the way, Axiom is actually in Portage (sci-mathematics/axiom) but 
it's the September 2005 tarball. I should bug the Gentoo Science folks 
about putting up a newer tarball, like the most recent Golden.

Yes, I can build axiom sans Aldor on gentoo as well.  The new
build-improvements work also functions on gentoo - very smooth!

Probably a good idea.

Hmm - I just tried to update AldorForAxiom with this info, and it won't
let me.  My preferences are set up - guess I need to go re-read the
anti-spam changes, I must be missing something.  Thanks Vanuxem!

Bill, sorry for being such a dork - I'm looking at AldorForAxiom, and I
don't quite see why it's not letting me save the change.  It looks like
most of the links are using the "link text":http... method, so I'm not
quite sure what it's objecting to.

Cheers,
CY

Cliff, the problem is not you - it's those dork spam artists who
insist on abusing our web site... :(

The reason your edit to AldorForAxiom was being rejected is
because the page contained at least one (actually there were
several) occurrences of http:// Since the very aggressive link
spam attach of last week that actually caused the wiki software
to crash at one point, this common prefix for links has been
banned on Axiom Wiki. Unfortunately this applies to both any new
text you enter as well as any pre-existing source text on that
page.

You can still enter links however they must be written using
WebSite: instead of http://, for example do not write:

  http://abc.com/help.html

instead write:

  WebSite:abc.com/help.html

Right now this also applies to=20

  "link text":http://...

which must be written like this:

  "link text" WebSite:...

although I will try to make the banned_links more flexible to
allow the latter form.

The reason for all this is to make it unattractive for people
who run spam robots to target our website.

I have updated the text of AldorForAxiom to remove the http's
so now you should be able to edit it.

I am very sorry for the trouble. I need to think about some way
of making the reason for the rejection and the way to get around
it more obvious for people who want to post to the wiki.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill - banning http:// on a wiki ? This makes me cringe.. what good is it 
if legitimate users can't add links.

I saw you have implemented a restriction on editing - it seemed to require 
a username configured in preferences, similar to my edits_need_username 
property. Are you getting significant spam even with this turned on ? They 
are configuring a username cookie ?

Ah ha!  OK, that makes sense.  I had been assuming that either a)
pre-existing links were OK in a re-save, or b) all existing links had
been converted.  My mistake.

That's what I was looking for - just didn't get far enough into that
thread on my archives.  Thanks!

Cool - I'll confirm that the libaxiom.mk fix is all that's needed and
then try again (building axiom silver now.)

No problem - thank you for putting the effort into keeping things
clean.  It might be worth looking at wikipedia - I think they have some
kind of bot which inspects changes and disallows the obvious spam,
although that's based on a comment I saw and I don't know much about
it.

Cheers,
CY

Also, current Zwiki is smarter about this - it tries not to count links 
that were in the page already.

             # does this edit look like spam ?
             # Tries to count the links added by this edit. Not perfect -
             # existing links on a line that you tweak will be counted.
             # Not sure what happens if you replace existing links.
             self.checkForSpam(self.addedText(old, new))

Most of these anti-spam refinements have been added in the last year, as it 
became a problem.

I'm gonna vote with Simon here...I know spam is a problem but this is
overkill.  Banning http will cause a lot of problems for new users,
exactly those a budding young project can't afford to alienate...

    Only after you've tried to figure something out for yourself and

Simon,

Me too. Although I set up a generic RemoteWikiURL page called
WebSite defined as just http:// so it is still possible to create
links to external sites - it's just harder. My intention was to
selectively create other more specific RemoteWikiURL pages when
I get a chance.

Yes.

And yes.

> 

Yes! :(( <weeping>

Not only that but someone who must really hate us (for no
reason as far as I can tell) actually setup a 350 member zombie
net that blasted our web site all day long last week. I admit
that banning http:// was a drastic move, but I was desparate.

BTW, I did read your recent posts about successfully merging
MathAction/LatexWiki back into Zwiki... :) That's what I like
about open source, if you wait long enough then you might just
get lucky and find someone willing to do the work you were
supposed to do! :) Thanks for doing this. I will setup a test
server on axiom-developer.org and install your merged version
to give it a test run. Then I will try to move the current
production contents into the test site. I will let you know
how it goes and then make it available for everyone to test.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Great!

With that version, you'll have the max_anonymous_links and 
max_identified_links options which you can use to allow links but only up 
to a certain number. Perhaps this will be enough to keep out most spam 
edits painlessly.

I should say: clearly there's times when you need to lock down temporarily 
to respond to an attack, I'm referring more to the long-term. Your use of 
remotewikilinks is clever, but too much hassle for users I think.

I visited the page above and found Tim Daly's AutoDocPamphlet. It was a
rather simple pamphlet but I found the documentation difficult to
follow. As an exercise, I totally revised the documentation (with a few
minor editing of the lisp code, which I don't think was for production
use). This experience raised a few issues, in particular, that revising
documentation may accidentally change the code because the code may be
editorially revised as well. For details see NewAutodocPamphlet by
following the link above or read the pdf file from 
http://zwiki.org/NewAutodocPamphlet

Hi,

I thing there is a problem with the log line when editing a file in the
wiki. When the statement is too long it is first cut off and printed
appropriate and nice. Only after the next edit a rest of the first
statement is appended to the new log line a gives nonsense.

Moreover, I have two questions concerning the tutorial. 

There are some parts about Fortran and IBM Script output and about the
extended ASCII code on IBM workstations. Is this still relevent or is it
sufficient, if this is just a topic in the second volume?

Does anybody know about good and short examples for the usage of Axiom
that make use of a kind of programming. That means short (one or two
pages) examples which consist of more than just calling predefined
functions.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to read emails in the next week so I
won't be able to react to any answers. Many thanks in advance. 

Frithjof

sigh.

noweb, configure, GCL, latex, svn, arch, darcs, etc....

i think we need to create a new top level file called "PROCON"
which contains a particular issue and summarizes the arguments
both for (PRO) and against (CON) a particular decsion. there
are many topics that keep coming up again and again. the mailing
list isn't a sufficiently specific way to collect these arguments.

once these are summarized we can point new people to the file.
unless some truly new argument is advanced we should not have to
revisit these decisions.

agree or disagree?

The token.pamphlet file contained a mistake. It should generate token.h,
not token.c. hyper.pamphlet does a #include for token.h. This is likely
a source of errors in the hyperdoc program. I'll fix it.

After two years of running the Axiom Wiki I am inclined to disagree.
It seems to me that there is very little we can do to overcome the
reluctance that new users feel to using a wiki. Those who do not
have this reluctance already have a high tolerance for the kind of
problems created by banning the use of http://anything. And then
there are people out there on the wild web who are willing and able
to exploit our resources for there own ends, no matter what we do
to try to prevent it.

Mostly I would conclude from this excersize that simply building
a wiki (however sexy or easy to use) and hoping that people will
simply show up to create content is misguided. You can point to
the counter-example of Wikipedia but I am convinced that here the
difference is only a matter of scale and not one of ease of use.

On the other hand I notice that a relatively high number of new
users (more than 120 people!) have registered for a user id and
password on the Axiom Portal - the Plone site that we run in
parallel to the Wiki. This in spite of the fact that we do not
make much of an effort to advertize it's existence. Plone's user
registration process does seem very easy to use. Oddly perhaps,
like the Axiom Wiki users most of these Portal users also do not
seem to create much in the way of new content. But they were
willing to register. 

Now personally I do not much like sites that require me to register
although I have to admit that I have gotten used to it over the
last couple of years.

So the solution to the spam problem that I like most right now is
to embed the existing Axiom Wiki site inside Plone and use the
standard Wiki skin to keep the same look and feel as the existing
site. This gives us access to the Plone user registration process
which allow us to limit edits and comments to authenticated users
and also would allow us to merge the content of both the Wiki and
the Portal without loosing any functionality.

What do you think?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Sounds familiar to me, so I don't have any objection.

[ that is the way we used to operate for libstdc++ and GCC.  that
does not means decision in stones, just that once we all agree, we
need new inputs, either not available at the time, or based on the
experience gained from following earlier directions. ]

I'm looking forward to the long threads we are going to have :-)

I would mostly agree.  But there's a lot to be said for ease of use.
More than ease of use I would say simply "aesthetic" -- kludgy, but
pretty interfaces are better than well-designed but ugly ones.
Wikipedia has aesthetic and scale on its side.

I think that's a fine idea.  I think it will handily solve your spam
problem, especially if the plone registration involves email
verification.  I'm not sure what you mean about wiki skins...but the
Plone interface is just fine.

But, plone is dog slow.  I'm not sure how axiom-developer is set up, but
you'll want a caching proxy.

As a matter of style I agree completely with all of William Sitt's
changes. I think this is a good example of the fact that the
existence of literate programming tools does not guarrantee either
good documentation or good programming. Writing and programming
both involve issues of objective skills and subjective styles. It
is very hard to say in advance what really "works" but it is not
so hard to decide after the fact.

I think this is an important point. I believe that noweb as a literate
programming environment is actually too flexible and generic. It does
not in and of itself encourage good style (either writing or
programming) and without some additional editing tools (such as one
might find as emacs modes) it does not even respect the distinction
between code chunks and documentation.

There is at least one better tool than noweb: Leo

http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html

I believe that many of the design features of Leo would be beneficial
to the Axiom project.

Bill Page.

Yes.

I like Plone too, but I think a lot of people are put off by the
complex top header menus and the left and right sidebars. We
discussed this back at the beginning of the Axiom Wiki project and
Martin Rubey (who was very active maintaining the content of initial
version of the Axiom Wiki site) was quite adement that *he* did not
like Plone.

When viewing Zwiki inside Plone, I usually feel a kind of clash of
style and a feeling that the limited real estate on my monitor is not
being used very efficiently.

> 
> But, plone is dog slow.

Apparently you have not tried the setup with Zwiki inside Plone
using Standard skins. I think you would be surprized that the
difference in performance seems to be almost entirely due to the
skins.

Axiom-developer uses both an Apache frontend and external cache
provided by the host environment.

I could be mistaken or confused. Are you suggesting using an SVN
branch called axiom--main--1? Or are you suggesting that the arch
version axiom--main--1 should be considered a testing branch?

In arch, axiom--main--1 is the golden version of the system.
It is supposed to be updated every 2 months. I'm way behind on this
due to conference/work/vacation collisions but testing is nearing
completion. 

axiom--main--1 is a fully tested/blessed version of the system.
It is mirrored on sourceforge (in cvs) and savannah (in cvs) once
it has been uploaded. All three updates occur at the same time.
This has been going on for the past 2 years.

My understanding was that the sourceforge svn was intended to be
a place where people can make and maintain their own branches. This
was previously available to anyone on http://arch.axiom-developer.org
The svn idea has morphed into the silver version of the system which,
as i understand it, is intended to contain proposed changes, similar
to Andrew Morton's -mm branch of linux. Morton's version of linux
has many changes that have never been put in the main branch.

If there is going to be an naming convention in svn it should 
probably NOT have an axiom--main--1 in the tree as this will only
cause confusion.

The philosophical difference between CVS and SVN is the idea of changesets.
In CVS it is not possible, except thru elaborate tagging, to associate a
set of changes of multiple files to a single idea. Axiom uses changesets
in arch as a substitute for tagging. However it would make more sense to
use changesets in svn since it would make it possible to apply a single
change to many files (eg, to update all the makefiles for one global change).
this change might add a feature and be completely independent of every other
change even though it changes multiple files. Limiting commits to one file
at a time makes SVN equivalent to CVS.

diff and patch are not intended to be read by humans. the fact that i
do read them and hand-apply the changes is a part of my twisted personality.
in general though, diff and patch are used virtually everywhere including
source code control systems.

The book--main--1 files are subsets of the original Jenks book 
broken along the lines of the first 4 volumes of the 10 volumes
in the axiom project. I had originally been keeping these on my
own systems but people requested that I post them so they could
work on writing them. That's why there is a separate branch. I'm 
unaware of anyone other than myself making changes. 

One of the changes I've been making is to search the axiom mailing
list archive to find emails that are related to particular volumes.
I copy the emails onto the end of the volumes so I know that these
topics need to be covered in the books. This is an example of a
very useful task that would help the books.

Volumes 1 thru 4 do not contain source code. Volumes 5 and onward
do contain source code. That's why Volume 5 is in the source tree.
(src/interp/bookvol5.pamphlet). Volume 1 in the book--main--1 is
now in the source tree as src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet. Volume 1 is
the axiom tutorial, which has now been published. I'm working on
Volume 2.

Can we just have the documentations as part of the SVN repository?

I think this would be a good use of the Axiom Wiki.

I suggest starting at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomCommunity

Add a comment explaining the intent and the page name

  ProCon

and then click on the blue ? to create the new page.

Bill Page.

In general, the tla archives are not used by anyone except me so we
can ignore the many branches.

However, the tla archive axiom--main--1 isn't going away any time soon.
It's my main location for work. But axiom is available under tla, svn,
cvs, or darcs so you can choose your own way of working. Posting 
diff -Naur changes to the mailing list allows anyone to see and adopt
your changes. 

In general, it is very difficult to coordinate multiple developers
working in parallel using their own working methods. It is unlikely
that we will all use the same techniques.

??? What "documentations" are you talking about? We do have all of
the available documentation for Axiom in SVN already, don't we?

What does this have to do with the Axiom Wiki?

font-lock?

Makefiles are rule based programs. Rule based programs are very hard
to debug. Axiom makefiles include debugging information in each stanza
making it trivially easy to figure out what failed (see the echo lines).

Makefiles that are dynamically generated (e.g. using -MM, using awk/sed
or Perl) move the debugging problem "up a level". Axiom maintained
the "dirt simple" principle that every file must have a stanza in the 
makefile. Do you want to know how a file is built? Find the file, look
at the Makefile in that directory. Find the stanza corresponding to that
file. There is your answer. Dirt simple. Easy to learn, easy to extend,
easy to debug, easy to customize. Did something fail? Read the failing
line for the file, search the makefile for the echo number. There is 
the failing stanza. 

Or you can use gcc -MM to create .d files, generate a makefile, dynamically
cons the makefile with the .d files, write out some perl scripts to handle
special cases and create both a perl dependency and a maintenance headache.

Frankly I can't figure out why the Makefiles are so hard to learn. They
are all so regular in structure and follow that dirt simple principle.
Every one except the src/algebra Makefile. And that Makefile will fail
under certain conditions (eg. forgetting to erase it during make clean).

Adding awk/sed/Perl/Python/Ruby/Java/JUnit/ccache/apt/yum/automake
has a complexity cost. Do we really need to depend on Perl to add
10 lines of code to a Makefile? Do we want to get into the problems that
causes? The last time I tried to update Perl on a system it ended
up requiring me to update GCC which broke EVERYTHING else. Oh, and
the next generation is now required to know Perl to maintain axiom.

The problem isn't that I don't understand the complex methods. 
The problem is that I am optimizing toward simplicity.

Gaby,

I'd suggest testing your configure scripts on both the MAC and FreeBSD,
both of which have given me a great deal of grief. If you can get 
configure to work on those systems it will prove very worthwhile.

I don't agree with Simon's solution, which seems to me to be a stop-gap
fix and not a long term solution. I don't like being limited in the
number of links I post on a Wiki-page. Example pages would be survey
articles with many links. Spammers do not need to post many links.  I
don't like Bill's change either, because since the new method of posting
URL is public, it is only a matter of time when spammers will be able to
write some new script to use the new convention and we will be back to
square one. This change in convention is also costly because we need to
modify all existing link references each time a page using the old
convention is updated. The ban on using "http://" anywhere in the source
is similar to the ban on using "<<" in pamphlet documentation sections.
Simon's solution partially solves this updating problem for now. 

However, I do find it easier to type "Website: abc.com" than
"http://abc.com," or the html way.

I think requiring user registration is a must. A naive suggestion to
make use of the user registration to avoid spam is to ban the user from
editing (put him in a blacklist for say 30 days) once he is known to the
system to have spam any page. Of course, the spammer can create new user
id, and perhaps one can also ban the IP address when repeat new user id
requests come from the same IP. The objective should be to cost the
spammer time, not at the inconvenience of regular users.

Requiring an email address to supply an initial password is also an
effective way to lessen spam. Other sites have also require the user to
read a random gif message and type it back to validate human presence.

Alternatively, we can also maintain a gold list of users, once people
have established their trustworthiness (after some constructive editing
or contribution).

That sounds great.

Hi Bill:

May I suggest putting a link sandox, which will open up a new SandBox
page with edit, on the top left of every Wiki page, right between
preferences and help? The page can be named SandBoxyyy where yyy is the
user id. When it is saved, the main sandbox page would be updated with a
link to it. A user can rename the page as well as reparent it as usual.
It would ease navigation each time someone wants to try something. Or at
least link that to 
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBox if that is not feasible.

I find the set up at the bottom of Zwiki.org quite easy to use. (It
would be even better if it were on the top of a page rather than at the
bottom, which may be missed unless one scrolls all the way down.)

Thanks,

William

Axiom has had several releases since 20050901.
What do we need to do to bring it up to date?

The use of ${TMP}/null rather than /dev/null is intentional.
Axiom does not write outside of it's directory subtree for any reason.
Following this philosophy it cannot write to /dev/null, which may not
even exist on certain platforms such as windows.

I took one run at Leo and bounced - I'm willing to try again, though. 
I may have also thought of a specific example which might be a good
test/showcase.

In outputing TeX instead of ASCII art, there are any number of specific
issues and design decisions that might need to be made on a per-topic
basis - the use of the SI style package for correct formatting of units
being once case I am aware of, another is the use of chemical packages
for LaTeX when implementing chemistry related pamphlets. 
Unfortunately, neither a centralized mechanism for all TeX style
outputs nor spreading these things over many pamphlets is ideal - the
centralized mechanism separates the TeX logic from the conceptual work
that it is linked to, and the diluted method makes a specific display
bug hard to track without knowing exactly what part of the codebase it
relates to.

Leo (if I understand it's concepts) could solve both of these problems.
 If the tex output code is in one or several discrete chuncks, and its
corresponding documentation is also organized this way, then it would
be possible using Leo to assemble either a document with all tex output
code in it (for output debugging) or a document with all code
pertaining to (say) the unit concept, which is more logical for
authoring and updating in a non-debugging context.  Both of these
outputs could be consistent, latexable pamphlet files, just generated
based on the focus of interest at the time of the query.

Bill, is that a reasonable use case for Leo+Axiom?  You are far more
fluent with it than I am.

Cheers,
CY

SBCL runs on Windows.

GCL is compiled code. CLISP is a byte-coded interpreted lisp.

Yes, Axiom builds and uses GCL. It is not yet ansi lisp.

That's good to hear! Native or CygWin?

IIRC clisp is what's enabled under CygWin.

My existing GCL is compiled with ANSI support, since Maxima requires
that. Will Axiom work with a GCL (2.6.7 IIRC) with ANSI support enabled?

Hi Bill:

When a pamphlet file is rendered, the date of the pdf file is always
\today. That seems to be misleading, as many of the source files have
not been updated for ages. Would it be possible to post the date of the
last modification of the pamphlet file (taken from the file attribute of
the PAMPHLET file, not the tex or pdf file)? Of course, this change of
date from \today to file date should not be done to the pamphlet itself,
but should be part of the extraction process by weave (or better, by the
\usepackage{axiom} using a modified \maketitle macro) so that instead of
inserting \today, one inserts the last modification date of the pamphlet
file (without touching it) to the tex source before applying latex.

BTW, in generating the tex source, perhaps one could also set up to
\usepackage{hyperref}, as part of \usepackage{axiom}? or should this be
left to the author?

Just minor suggestions. Not a high priority if there is no easy
solution.

William

I am just now trying to learn Leo. My first impression is that it is
*way* too integrated with Python. I'm on the Leo message forums, and
unless you're a Python hacker (which I'm not) most of it goes way over
your head.

I like what Leo is *trying* to be, and I suppose I'll learn how to make
it do what I want *eventually*. But for now, I've more or less fallen
back on more "manual" techniques in my attempts to do "literate
programming."

To be fair, the two languages I'm attempting to program in Leo are R and
Ruby, not Axiom and not Python. On the R side, I've had pretty good luck
with LyX ... it seems to edit the R noweb files (.rnw) directly and not
require a whole lot of messing around to make a usable document. For
now, though, Leo is just an outliner of ASCII text files and not a
"literate programming IDE" for R or Ruby. Good luck with it -- if any of
you have any pointers on how to use it without having to learn Python,
I'm all ears. :)

I think this is definitely worth a try. If you're being targetted by 
persistent spammers I too think that requiring a one-time registration for 
edits is the way to go.

Bill:

I updated http://Zwiki.org/NewAutodocPamphlet to use hyperref package
and everything works fine there.

I then tried to copy it to [SandBox NewAutodocPamphlet] and parent it
under [SandBoxPamphlet]. I get some problems when previewing.
Most of these were temporarily solved by avoiding any "http" in the
text. The pdf file read fine and the links worked (subject to bad url
because Website under \href does not get translated; the Zwiki site
allows "http"). There are other problems as well, see [SandBoxPamphlet].

However, after I actually saved it, the pamphlet is not processed
correctly. I even tried to change the makefile section to give some new
names like 'SandBox NewAutodocPamphlet.pamphlet' but that did not work
either. It seems to be a mismatch of file names, or mixing up filenames
with Tim's dhmatrix pamphlet file.

I also tried reparenting it to [SandBox], the error messages were
slightly different, but essentially the same processing problems.

Most importantly, the idea of banning "http" does not work (unless more
code is added) when used with \usepackage{hyperref} if \href is used.
For info on hyperref, see
http://www.etdguide.org/content/3.2.4.2%20%20PDF%20from%20LaTeX.htm .

Any help would be much appreciated. The solution probably requires a
comparison between the setups at Zwiki (where things worked) and Axiom
(where they did'nt).

Many thanks,

William 


PS: I'll be in Vancouver, Canada from Aug 15 to 21. So no need to fix
this immediately.

Why don't people use http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/FAQ for that?
Who would look for a file called PROCON?

http://zwiki.org/NewAutodocPamphlet

I am not a lisp programmer at all, but the lisp code is missing ">>" so 
I guess, a line like

<<pa SHORT Long=

will be accepted as introducing a code chunk name. I am pretty sure that 
I could even produce a valid Aldor program that contains exactly this line.

William, I like your style much more than the original one from
http://zwiki.org/AutodocPamphlet , but I was once told that I should 
write an executive summary. Honestly, when I read the abstract it was 
not completely clear to me what this program does. It is nice that you 
show the usage, but I must say, if the output is not too long, it is 
also illustrative to include it in the Usage section. (That should even 
be a kind of simple unit test.)

Sorry that was a terrible error on my part. In that mail you refer to
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00175.html
I spoke about http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/FrontPage 
and of course I would not turn the Gold branch axiom--main--1 into a 
testing one.

But that script must certainly be improved.

1) It does not call bibtex.
2) It does not call makeindex.
3) It ALWAYS applies latex twice where sometimes 1 application would be 
enough and sometimes one needs 3 or 4 iterations.

There is a bug in the software that occurs if the page name contains
a space.

I have relaxed the restrictions on the use of http:// on the Axiom
Wiki. Now it is allowed following "...": (the way links are done
in Structured Text) and up to 5 bare occurrences of http://. So it
should now be possible to use http:// (almost) normally again.

I am not sure about the rendering of $hp$$pt:$. I think it is a
LaTeX artifact. But this sort of hack shouldn't be necessary any
more.

These problem were all probably caused by the page name that
contained a space. I have removed the space and it seems ok now.

As I said above, I have relaxed the restriction on the use of http://

Again the difference was caused just by the blank in the page name.
I will correct this bug in the near future.

I think the use of \today in the LaTeX source is inappropriate unless
for some reason the author really does want the date on which the
document was compiled displayed in the text. Usually it is better
to simply hard code a fixed date and manually update that when it
is appropriate.

That is a neat idea, but it is a LaTeX thing that is beyond my skill
level in LaTeX. If there was such a macro that used the file date,
then we could use that in our pamphlet files.

I think it should be left to the author.

Maybe.  The fact that we have so many diff options (in particular -p)
is evidence that it is intended to be read by humans, albeit with
particular skill set.

That is true.  However, to make sure we don't end up in a bizarre

I don't think Makefiles in general are that very hard.  Just like one
may write very twisted spaghetti codes in higher level programming
languages, one can write hard to understand Makefiles.

I happen to find Axiom Makefiles quite non-palatable.  Part of the
problem is that similar information are not properly abstracted over
and particular information of interested are deeply hidden in a sea of
noise. Fortunately, we're working to improve thge situation.

I would like to see the document script either go away or deeply improved.

I know it is intentional.  However, I seriously question the decision
behind it. 

Anyway, currently ${TMP}/null is useless one build noweb.

That is close to theology.  /dev/null is very particular and must be
exempted from the general rule.

Which "flavour" of windows that can built Axiom (with current build
system) and does not have /dev/null?

It's not a question of theology or flavors (or flavours).  The issue
again comes back to basic, easily stated, easily learned, universally
followed principles. In Axiom 

  all files are literate.  
  all directories have Makefiles that handle their subtrees.  
  all Makefiles have a stanza per file (or used to)
  all stanzas have unique identifing numbers
  all non-axiom tools live under zips
  all human written files live under SRC
  all machine-generated, system-independent files live under INT
  all machine-generated, system-dependent files live under OBJ
  all final shipped files live under MNT. 
  all literate files use the same bibtex file or will once we get it working.
  etc...


If you state a principle there is nothing else to explain.

The guiding principle in this case is that 

  Axiom never writes outside its own directory

Thus Axiom does not use /tmp but creates and saves files in OBJ. Axiom
does not use /dev/null by the same principle.  It cannot and does not
assume that /dev exists. It doesn't need to make that assumption since
the ${TMP}/null file is always overwritten unless the build fails. And
if the build fails you have a record of the last failure. So /dev/null
is not needed and loses information.

Every effort is made to use the simple and most general rules.  At one
point Axiom's Makefiles worked both under traditional 'make' and 'gnu
make'. Now they have been changed to only work under 'gnu make'. This
makes porting to the MAC, FreeBSD, and Solaris ever so much more
tedious. Axiom used to build cleanly under Solaris. It no longer does.
In the 30 year horizon view, this is not progress.

> 

Why? If we assume /dev/null exists we will open ourselves to a porting
issue as soon as we attempt a native Windows port. The current system
does not have that problem. Why introduce it? And under what principle?
I don't see why we 'must' do anything special.

Your question, or perhaps more accurately the assumptions behind
your question, still seems unclear to me.

SVN is a source code repository. The wiki is a web site with
dynamic content, e.g. the results of Axiom calculations, and
the status of issue reports etc. So I think the answer to your
question is: No.

Bill Page.

I do not mean to imply the Gaby should be doing this additional work,
since he is already doing a great deal to improve the build environment,
but in fact we do have easy access to these systems.

I can understand Gaby. For working offline it would be good to have the 
wiki locally and have it updated like any SCM repository. But it seems 
that cannot be easily achieved, because at least one needs to set up 
Zope, Zwiki, latexwiki, mathaction on the local computer. That is hard 
enough. And always downloading a >1MB Zope database if just a single 
file changes is not very convenient.

So, I guess, the answer is: "Currently, no. Until somebody improves the 
situation."

Thank you, Tim, for sharing these principles with the rest of the axiom 
developers. I did not know all of them. Where are they written down, 
except now hidden in the mailing archive under a strange "Subject"???

Oh, another person who does not like "document" very much...

I can understand Tim's idea of a drag&drop system, but it implies that a 
new "algebra idea" is completely coded in ONE file. It's not like the 
"changeset" stuff. And for the Axiom build system it would be better to 
have not just a collection of Makefiles that you document (and read) 
separately. It is really hard to get an overview of what relates to 
what. I would rather like to have a document that describes the build. 
But I guess that document consists of several Makefiles and a 
description of their relations.

| It's not a question of theology or flavors (or flavours). 

I'm sorry to say, but a principle followed blinded without taking into
account reality is theology.

[...]

| If you state a principle there is nothing else to explain.

That *is* theology.

| The guiding principle in this case is that 
| 
|   Axiom never writes outside its own directory

This *is simply untrue*, at least if you build Axiom+GCL.

| Why?

Because there simply is no single system on which Axiom has been built
and where it was impossible to redirect to /dev/null/  That is a
*fact*.  Your principles must take that fact into account.

Exactly on which windows where will you be able to build Axiom without the
ability to rediect to /dev/null.  I believe you are trying to solve a
theoretical problems that has no practical foundation.


As a data point, there are plenty of software Autoconfiscated that
build and runs perfectly on windows.

  The installation of Zope -> ZWiki -> LatexWiki -> Mathaction is has not
been
   that difficult, at least in the systems I have tried them (Fedora,
Ubuntu, Gentoo).
   With the work done by Bill, and the information online I would dare to

   has become "trivial".  For Doyen, a single script does the whole
installation. Of
   course, this is not bullet proof for every system. A virtual machine can

   I wonder if one could have the Zope database on svn and then do an update
to
   keep with the latest changes.

> Oh, another person who does not like "document" very much...

'document' is a script intended to collect the usual document handling
functions which standard options. i put it there so i can use it to
build files during make and later to build files during development.
it's unlikely that you would use it yet.

That's the purpose of book volume 4, the developer's guide. 
Understand the process, write it as a chapter, and add it to the guide.

Bill, thank you very much for sharing this information with me.  
I suspected we somehow had access to SF machines but did not know how
to get them.  I should have asked.

I'm certainly an amateur as far as Axiom goes, but not an amateur for
large projects development so I don't take offense :-)
It certainly makes sense that large infrastracture changes be tested
on at least three primary targets before committing to mainline --
though we should not put the dogma to require that all platforms are
tested before committing to mainline.

As a matter of fact, on purpose I did NOT propose to merge the 
"build improvements" work to mainline because I do not feel satisfied
with it.  Rather, I've begged for testing from people, and I thank all
of you who tested and send feedback either publically or privately.
I'm committed to improve this and propose it for mainline (i.e. silver).
It will be up to Tim whether he wants it for the gold branch.

I will like us to define "primary platforms" and "secondary platforms".
A primary platform is one where any regression must be fixed after it
is noticed or the patch reverted if its author cannot fix it in timely
manner (e.g. within 48 hours).  We cannot maintian silver broken for a
known primary platform.

A secondary platform is one where the patch reversal ruls has a
relaxed content.

For concretness, here is a initial list of primary platforms:

  * i686-pc-linux-gnu
  * x86_64-*-linux
  * stable supported *BSD
  * powerpc-*-darwin*

[...]

| Anyone who is motivated to try this can be registered as an Axiom developer
| to try the Axiom builds on these systems.

I have a private script for automatically building Axiom; do you think
there is a was to set up a cron job on those systems?

Well, one could always set up FileSystemSite:
    http://www.infrae.com/download/FileSystemSite
and put the wiki there.  It is a single directory after all.  That would
help with SCM.

Then one could just "pull" the entire wiki as a series of text files.  I
think if the relevant directory were under svn/cvs/darcs control, the
wiki will ignore the extraneous files.  Of course, what happens when
Zope writes an update to a wiki file?

The entire zope database!?!?  One big 1GB file?  Each minor ZODB change
would be a single replacement of the ~1GB ZODB.  -- Which is why
FileSystemSite is probably required if you want to use SCM.

It stands in my way for having a more structured build system.

When in the cyle design-code-build-test; I don't need all those dvi
that document insist on building.  I have configure generate my
Makefiles, but document want to generate its own.

document was a necessary step to get Axiom to the state where it is
now.  But now, it either has to give the way or mutate significantly.
Most of the functionalities offered by document are superceded in my
work. So, unless, it mutates and offers me something I need and I don't
have now, it must be retired.

it is untrue? i'm confused.

axiom builds gcl in the lsp subdirectory which is contained
within the axiom build tree.

and every single system has /tmp but we don't use it.

the ${TMP} directory was created because i ran into a build problem.
another user tried to build Axiom and was using files on /tmp with
the same name. this caused permission problems and caused the build 
to fail. this can't happen anymore.

i understand your point that /dev/null seems "ok".
the current ${TMP}/null works.
why change it? did something break?

eh? again i'm confused.

'document' is like 'tar', it handles a pamphlet file format with options
just like 'tar' handles gzip files.

'document' is intended to be the primary command used throughout axiom
to manipulate pamphlets, including drag-and-drop. it also handles 
issues of "NOISE" which is a top-level make function. if you say

   make NOISE=

you will see all of the latex output. without the NOISE= it will
not output the latex. the makefiles don't need to know how to
suppress noise.

there is no reason that the makefiles need to know about the
command sequences necessary to translate pamphlet files just like
there is no reason that makefiles need to know how to gunzip tar files.

why would a single command which centralizes all of the knowledge
of how to translate a pamphlet to tex, dvi, pdf, spad, etc be an issue?

Yes, GCL's configure redirects to /dev/null.

Frankly, the Autotools guys have faced more exotic systems than Axiom

No, it does not.  After noweb is built, have a look at ${TMP}/null; is
that what you were expecting?
On all my builds, I see elisp file for emacs support for noweb.

it does not work and it is mostly pointless.

I tend to agree, but that puts the burden on whoever revises a file
(which adds one more tiny step to the process). I would prefer if is
done automatically.
The \today seems to be a default when \date is not present in the tex
source.
I now added \date to NewAutodocPamphlet (and some other additional
documentation).

No, the latex thing is simply to add a line \date{...} where you can put
pretty much anything there (see [SandBoxNewAutodocPamphlet]).  It can be
done probably  with a unix hack to obtain the date of last modification
(maybe looking at the inode of the file system). However, I am sure
there is a utility to do just that.
Once the date is known, some batch editor can insert the \date line into
the generated latex file (it has to also detect that no \date line is
there), right before \maketitle. Alternately, may be those in the know
can make a \filedate macro. Any takers?

Come to think of it, each pamphlet file should include a revision
history, with dates, much like code. So we should have latex macros
\creationdate, \revisiondates, and \filedate (which may be included in
\revisiondates).

I think pamphlet docs should be more uniform in general appearance. Why
would anyone be against using hyperref?

BTW, there is an error in [SandBoxNewAutodocPamphlet]:

Traceback (most recent call last): File
"/var/zope/Products/ZWiki/plugins/Fit.py", line 29, in ? from fit.Parse
import Parse ImportError: No module named fit.Parse

The file does display correctly as far as I can tell.

I think I will remove NewAutodocPamphlet from the Zwiki site (so I don't
have to maintain two versions, the zwiki version is already out of date
:-). I'll leave a pointer there to SandBox. What do you think?

Hello,

As Bill, I think hard-coded modification date is preferable, as it
allows minor modification (e.g. fixing typo). Of course, it depends on
the semantics you espect on the date.

Doesn't that revision history belong to the changesets of the Source
Code Management system, whichever it is?

Yours,

As you can see, document insists on LaTeXing a file, which, as I said,
when in a design-code-build-test mode, I'm not interested in.  It just
wastes my time.  I rather have a separate [hase for building .dvi
files than trying to conflate everything together.  Maybe that mode
will be only for developers, but then document is not my solution.

Futhermore, my Makefiles are generated from configure using .in files
as inputs (the infiles themselves are generated from pamphlet files)
-- I don't want document to touch them, it simply it not sophisticated
enough to understand what is going on.

On the build-improvements branch for example, here is the sequence of
events:

  * developer edits Makefile.pamphlet.
  * developer produces Makefile.in from pamphlet files

  * users invokes ./configure
  * configure reads in Makefile.in, compute values for some
    placeholders  in Makefile.in (Makefile.pamphlet) and instantiate
    Makefile (in the build directory) reflection configure options,
    build and target systems.

document can't understand that and handle that.

BTW, document has been modified (on the build-improvments branch) to
the point where it can use either system supplied noweb or noweb from
aXiom.  And document is also generated by configure.

i work in a literate style all the time now. every few lines i change
i completely notangle-compile-test-noweeave-latex-xdvi as a single
process. that way i know that the program still works, still TeXs, 
and the code and text are in sync.

literate programming is a fundamental change in the way one thinks.
programs are written for people, not machines so TeXing the file is primary.

surely you can't be suggesting that people still write naked code files....

you are, in fact, working as a developer so i'd hope that all of your
new makefile machinery is pamphlet files.  and the design principles
should come first, as in the top level Makefile so the next generation
can follow the religion.  so why wouldn't a greatly improved
'document' command be primary? 

a two-pass process would allow a latex typo to stop the system build
very late in the process whereas it logically should occur the first
time the file is used. 'document', with the appropriate options,
should completely handle the file, no?

it's hard for me to consider 'document', the primary command for handling
pamphlet files, as unnecessary.

I think you misundertood.  The issue is not that of removing TeXing.
The issue is that of *delyaing* TeXing to another phase.

The TeXing is pointless when it is not needed.

By now, I think I know that psaulm by heart :-)

they are.  What I'm saying that I work in various modes -- just like
various people work different.  They are modes where the TeXing is
just a pure waste of time for no reason.

In another mode, where full build is necessery to check that the
system is working, TeXing is mandatory.  No single size fits all.

| and the design principles

because, it is secondary.  When I'm in a position where I'm satsified
with the build system, I will at how document can be improved to do
what it should be doing with the build system.  document is not an end
in itself.  It is tool.  I need to explore the landscape before I know
how to manufacture the tool to suit my needs.

| a two-pass process would allow a latex typo to stop the system build

TeXing and compiling SPAD, C, or LISP are two aspects of checking that
source files we check in the repository are "correct".  At the moment
they are entangled.  I'm saying that that entaglment ignores the
important fact that at various stages of development not all two
aspects need to be done simulatenously at the same time.  However,
they must be done before modification happens in the repositories.

        -gaby-mode)
            gaby_mode=yes;;
        *) 
            FILE=`basename $1 .pamphlet`;;
    esac
    shift
done

latex=`which latex`
if [ "$latex" = "" ] ; then
  echo document ERROR You must install latex first
  exit 1
fi

if [ "$FILE" = "" ] ; then
  echo document ERROR You must provide a file name
  echo "document [ -o redirect ] [ -gaby-mode ] file.pamphlet"
  exit 1
fi

tangle=$AXIOM/bin/lib/notangle
weave=$AXIOM/bin/lib/noweave

$tangle -t8 $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE

if [ "$gaby_mode" == "no" ]; then
    $weave -delay $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE.tex
    if [ "$REDIRECT" == "" ]; then
        $latex $FILE.tex 
        $latex $FILE.tex
    else
        $latex --interaction nonstopmode $FILE.tex >$REDIRECT
        $latex --interaction nonstopmode $FILE.tex >$REDIRECT
    fi

    rm -f $FILE.pamphlet~

I also vote for hardcoded version or date information in a file. If you 
take the modification time of the file, it might be a bit confusing if 
an identical file appears in another branch of Axiom. Those two files 
will probably have different times and all you see in the .dvi is that 
they seem to be different.

I am also wondering why we would use some SCM and then hardcode 
\creationdate, etc. You can use, for example, "svn log FILENAME" and get 
all the wonderful history.

| Hello,

| Ok, so why not modifiying 'document' itself, like in:

Really, I don't believe the issue is that of "gaby mode".  
document is doing too many things at the same time.
There was a comparison with tar earlier.  However, tar does many
things at the same only if you give many options :-).

I would like to see:

   --all                # do "everything"
   --weave              # extract tex files, don't compile
                        # probably with more options, e.g. --delay

   --tangle             # extract source code, probably with more
                        # option, e.g. --tabs=8

Those are what I currently use; you're welcome to expand and submit as
a patch and pray Father Tim accepts it :-)

Hello,


Hypertex does not work for me with the last version of axiom (gold)
checked out from cvs at Savannah. I have just a white window with two
buttons (exit and help) that do not work. Here is the output:

If I use an older version of util.ht Hypertex works (I think Martin
encountered a similar problem if it is not the same). The diff between
the two versions is attached.

I forgot to say that I do not use the "install" target of the makefile.
I use axiom directly in its built tree.

Why would two identical files have different modification time? I
suppose people are not careful with using -p to copy files? Ok, forget
that, but then insist that \date appears hardcoded.

There is a difference: when such info is given in the pamphlet file, it
is given in context, not as logs. Moreover, one has to actively ask for
the log, but if there is no indication in the pamphlet file, where would
one get a reason to look through a log file? Imagine that in my recent
revision of Tim's autodoc.lisp.pamphlet, if I had checked out the
original, made the revisions, checked it back in and documented the
revision notes separately at check-in, then when someone reads my
version, it would just look like an original document, where there would
be no indication why I made the changes (that info would be kept as a
terse comment when I checked the revision in) and a trip to the
changeset or diff file wouldn't work because the revision is a total
rewrite. I don't know how Tim applies patches, but if it only involves
removing the minus lines and insert the plus lines, someone reading the
source code would not be helped unless the changes are documented in the
pamphlet file -- but that would meant maintaining revision history
(albeit not necessarily with dates) in the pamphlet file itself.

Since I am not a developer (certainly not the system-related stuffs), if
SCM already maintains history info to your satisfaction, good for you.
My own experience is that I seldom would have the need to retract back
to a certain date since I don't remember what particular date would
still have a working version. Rather, if some half-baked ideas in an
attempted new version did not work out, I would revert completely to a
previously frozen version that I know worked and start over. Even that
is quite seldom, and often I just keep working until the half-baked
ideas got cooked and working, then I freeze and save it and proceed to
explore other ideas.

I corrected the problem. It turned out that there was some legacy
ZWiki code relating to something called the "Framework for
Interactive Tests"

http://zwiki.org/ZwikiAndFit

that was being incorrectly triggered by the specific content of
your document. I have disabled 'Fit' on MathAction. This problem
has probably been corrected in a later version of Zwiki than what
we are currently using on MathAction, which is the reason why it
did not show up on the zwiki.org version.

I think it looks good.

Can anyone confirm?

I any case this same method of building Axiom is used in Debian
although it has never been incorporated in to the main Axiom
source distribution.

Great! This should also make the Debian port a lot simpler.

Camm,

When you have a moment could you please confirm that I am not
leading Gaby astray here. :-)

Thanks.

It was corrected in GCL-2.6.7 shortly after Tim took the tarball
image from cvs.

Good idea.

The above two are handled by compiler-link in an unmodified
previously installed copy of GCL.

This one is handled by setting an option.

>   * gcl-2.6.8pre.collectfn.fix

This one just copies (and renames) gcl_collectfn.lsp to a different
location in the file system and copies sys-proclaim.lisp to that
location for use at a later stage in the build. It has nothing to
do with patching GCL and should be addressed by modifications to
the appropriate makefile.pamphlet.

I was just repeating what the pamphlet file says :-)

I have requested access to SF compile farm.  I hope to be in position
to test tomorrow, but we should definitely have some *BSD guys shime it.

Dear all,

I did not follow all of the discussions lately, so I might have missed
something.

I only noticed that on

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AldorForAxiom

the calculations done in Aldor do not work anymore, axiom says, for example,

      >> System error:
     The storage for STRING is exhausted.
  Currently, 112 pages are allocated.
  Use ALLOCATE to expand the space.

???

Martin

This is happening because on the axiom-developer server we are
not able to build Axiom with the maxpages option set to 256*1024
because of a GCL memory allocation limitation on this particular
architecture. In the version of GCL that we are using, the next
largest allowed memory size is 128*1024.

Camm Maquire has worked on this problem.

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00195.html

and has provided a modified gcl-2.6.8pre in cvs. I tried this but ran
into additional problems. Camm has a fix:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00225.html

that allows maxpages to be increased but also requires a patch to
some Axiom lisp code.

When I get a chance I plan to complete the build Axiom Silver build
improvements branch with these changes and install that on MathAction.
That should solve the problems and also more help to test Silver.


Regards,
Bill Page.

Gaby,

I just did a

  $ svn update

and tried to build Silver on axiom-developer.org

I get the following error message at the end of

  $ ./configure

...
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: error: cannot find input file: config/setup-dep.mk

  $ ls config
config.guess  config.sub  install-sh  missing

---------

Any idea what is going wrong?

Regards,
Bill Page.

The ChangeLog says:

          * config/setup-dep.mk: New file.

But svn update wont give me the file. Maybe you forgot to add it?

No problem!

My test build with Camm's patches is running now on
axiom-developer.

Thanks.

Camm,

With your patch below applied to the current Silver version
of Axiom with the modified gcl-2.6.8pre pulled from cvs,
I get a different result, but an error persists:

  $tail -18 build3.log

Loading /home/page/axiom.build-improvements/obj/linux/interp/cformat.o

--------

directoryp is a C function defined in 'src/lib/cfuns-c.c.pamphlet'.
I have checked the rest of the build3.log and it seems to me that
cfuns-c was built and linked properly, i.e. the "old way" via an ini
file.

Got any ideas?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Do you recall that this patch also involves a new version of
gcl-2.6.8pre? I am not sure whether the patch is applicable to
the older version of gcl-2.6.8pre in the Axiom repositories.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I can confirm, it is.I have requested access to SF compile farm.  I hope
to be in position

Can you give me some instruction, where do get the respective sources
etc (off-the-list)

Axiom Developers and computer algebra enthusiasts!

I have a very preliminary demonstration of the integration
of Sage with the MathAxiom wiki here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSageTest

I would like to encourage you to test this further. You will
find that Sage is quite different than any other computer
algebra system with which you might be familiar - truly a
"new generation".

This approach to interfacing with Sage is based directly on
the work of Gonzalo Tornaria and Joe Wetherell et al. for use
with LaTeX. The LatexWiki software on which MathAction is
based needed only minor modifications to make direct use
of the 'examples/latex_embed' code in the Sage distribution.
Long live open source... :-)

Enjoy!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Alfredo,

It's all yours - it's open source. :) I will update the MathAction
repositories later today after we get a little more testing done.
It should be easy for you to incorporate this into the Doyen CD

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/DoyenCD

You might also be interested in the pamphlet support for Sage
which comes very naturally with the way pamphlets are implemented
on MathAction (MathAxiom? ;)

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSagePamphlet

So now we can start to discuss literate programming with
the Sage developers.

You asked:

> Do people in Sage considering including Axiom???

Yes, this has been considered by some of the Sage developers.
They chose Maxima as the first system of this kind to integrate
with Sage apparently because it was easier. Axiom, however is
both more difficult and at the same time perhaps more interesting
than Maxima because of it's strong typing and underlying object-
orientation. Sage provides a strongly-typed object-oriented view
of mathematical objects not so different than SPAD and Aldor,
except that types are (mostly) static in Aldor but dynamic in
Sage. In principle it should be possible to develop an interface
between Axiom and Sage that preserves much more of the mathematical
structure than what is possible in other computer algebra systems.

The ability to transfer mathematical structures between very
different mathematical systems (only a little structure in some
cases, but it other cases a lot) is one of the most innovative
things about Sage. (This is in contrast to MathAction which only
provides a common user interface but does not transfer data
between systems.) So the way I see it, Sage provides the much
needed glue to take advantage of the huge prior investment in
mathematical software - of which Axiom is one very important
example. From the point of view of Axiom we can also view Sage
as a new user interface, not so different than what B# (Bnatural)
was intended to be.

I think the Sage developers were very bold - maybe even audacious -
to actually attempt this. And they are doing it in a largely
pragmatic way without attempting to incorporate the more formal
and theoretical ideas developed by the OpenMath community. One
might have been tempted to predict an early failure to this
effort but on the contrary Sage seems to be growing more rapidly
than any other computer algebra research and development effort.
I guess this just provides one more demonstration that software
development - particularly open source software development -
is not a linear process. :)

So I am very enthusiastic about the idea of developing a serious
Axiom interface for Sage and I hope we can find more resources
here in the Axiom developer group to work on this. I have read
most of the Sage Maxima interface code and I think it forms a
pretty good basis on which to start to build an Axiom interface.

Is anyone interested?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have upgraded Graphviz to the most recent version of GraphViz
that I could find on the web:

http://people.csail.mit.edu/drayside/latex/graphviz.new/graphviz.pdf

http://people.csail.mit.edu/drayside/latex/graphviz.new

Thus web site was a little hard to find and there are other
older versions at different locations. Anyway, these files are
dated 11-Jan-2006 and make reference to some improvements
submitted by Ralf Hammecke, so I think these are probably the
right ones.

This version also incorporates the psfrag package to permit
arbitrary LaTeX symbols and equations to be inserted into
the graphs. This works very nicely as you can see from

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/GraphViz

The new version also allows an arbitrary number of graphs
to appear on a page by working around a limitation of LaTeX
on the number of open files.

The new version of Graphviz is also supported in pamphlet
files and works with the hyperref package to include clickable
links on graphs. See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/Endpaper3

Challenge: Create a GraphViz graphic like a flowchart that
automatically includes the computed output of \sage{...}
commands. (Note: This might require a change to the graphviz.sty
and sagetex.sty packages or the MathAction/LatexWiki page
rendering software.)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes, those are the files.  I should really update the website and get 
graphviz.org to update their links ... sorry about that ... glad you guys 
are finding it useful.

I'm not familiar with SAGE, but I'm certainly open to making enhancements 
...

best,
Derek.

Alfredo,

'sagetex.sty' is part of the Sage distribution. Look in your

   sage-root/examples/latex_embed

On axiom-developer look at:

  /home/page/sage-1.3.6.2/examples/latex_embed

I used everything from this directory just as it is with no
modifications. I added 'sagetex.sty' to the LaTeX style
directories in the same place as 'axiom.sty'. The only slightly
tricky thing was to locate 'sagetex.py' where it could be
found by sage (answer: var/LatexWiki).

You will see that 'sagetex.sty' and 'sagetex.py' must work
together.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Well I definitely am interested.   I've already started thinking about
writing an interface.   Here are some quick questions to get things started:

Alfred,

On Wednesday, August 16, 2006 1:30 PM you asked:

> Sorry Bill. Is it possible to have sandbox for Doyen ???

I am not sure about the exact meaning of your question. But
the answer is yes in both cases below.

If you are asking if you can have a "SandBox" on the Doyen CD,
then this seems a little strange because all that SandBox means
is that all page additions and edits are silent, i.e. the
wiki will not send out email notices. But normally the option
of sending emails would not even be enabled on the DoyenCD
because it is local to your workstation. So all pages are
"SandBox" pages.

On Axiom Wiki it is easy to create SandBox pages. "Sandbox" is
just a set of pages whose names all begin with the default
prefix 'SandBox' (there is a parameter that can be set to
designate other prefixes as as "silent"). All you have to do
is write a WikiWord like:

  SandBoxMyPageName

somewhere (using the SandBox prefix) when you edit a page or
when you make a comment. Then that name will become a link to
a new page. Just click on the blue ? beside the name to create
the new page. Because it begins with the SandBox prefix, it
will automatically be silent.

Does that answer your question?

Regards,
Bill Page.

My apologies -- all my testing is with the Debian package, so I did
not see this.  Can you please give me simple instructions whereby I
might obtain silver and reproduce this?  Preferably stable
retrieve-and-make-the-latest instructions that I can store in 1 cons
of long term brain memory :-)?

Take care,

Dear William,

unfortunately, I don't have all the answers. But, anyway, that's what I know:

>     -- Could you give me an example that illustrates "exec"'ing the
>        contents of a text file from within Axiom?  (This sort of thing
>        is used by SAGE when input lines are huge.)

This one is very easy. You just write the functions into a file "myfile.input",
and then say

)read myfile.input

or

)re myfile.input

at the axiom prompt. Here is a real life example: the following is a file I
currently use. it reads a file called "stripped" from my harddisk and does some
computations. Note that it reads another input file itself. To minus signs mean
"comment", a close parenthesis in the first column means "system command", "_"
is the line continuation character.

-- getsloane.input ---------------------------------------------------------
)re guess2.input

-- get next sequence
-- we assume that f is a TextFile containing sequences in the format
-- A120493 ,1,2,3,4,

coerceINT(s: String): Integer == integer(PARSE_-INTEGER(s)$Lisp)

coerceLINT(r: String): List Integer ==
        map(c +-> coerceINT c, split(r, char(","))$String)_
          $FiniteLinearAggregateFunctions2(String, List String, Integer, _
                                           List Integer)

-- transforms a list into a SUP
makef(l:List INT):SUP INT == 
  reduce(_+, [monomial(e, n)$SUP(INT) for e in l for n in 0..#l])

-- we return the list of integers [1,2,3,4]
getSequence!(f: TextFile): List Integer ==
   r:String := readLine!(f)$TextFile
   r := delete(r, 1..8)
   coerceLINT(r)

f := open("stripped")$TextFile

repeat (l := getSequence!(f); n := #l; r := min(30, n); _
        if # guessADE(l, safety==(n-r)::NNI, debug==true) > 0 then output l)

-- getsloane.input ---------------------------------------------------------

>     -- If X is an Axiom variable, is there a way to ask the Axiom command
>        line for a list of function that take X as the first argument?

I doubt it, but that might be doable. However, what would you need this for?
Very likely, there will be very many operations taking an integer as first
argument, for example.

>     -- Is there a way to get a list of all the types that are defined
>        in a given Axiom session?

Yes, this is possible. Enter

)what domain

to get all domains,

)wh cat

to get all categories,

)wh pack

to get all packages

)wh op

to get all operations,

)wh th

to get all things.

Again, the lists are quite long.

>     -- Is there a way to change the prompts, i.e., to be much more
>        difficult to confuse with valid output?

I think this is unneccessary given axioms ability to speak in various
modes. For example, say

)set tex on
)set algebra off

to get a feeling for it.



I think, the truly interesting thing will be how to deal with axioms type
system. I once wrote a wrapper for polymake which was not difficult. The
tedious bit however is, that you have to decide for each function which type it
should have in axiom, and, since axiom is not perfect, many types are
missing. (Eg., there is no type for graphs)

Note, furthermore, that in axiom the displayed output does not nearly capture
everything of the internal datastructure. Using output as input works only for
those types that have ConvertibleTo(InputForm). Well that makes 57 Domains,
which is quite OK, I guess..

(To see them, use HyperDoc: click Browse, enter KONVERT, click Constructors,
enter INFORM, click Domains.)

Martin

The Axiom command: )display will provide some useful information.

 )display      : display Library operations and objects in your
workspace

E.g.

---------

(1) -> I:Integer
                                Type: Void
(2) -> S:String
                                Type: Void
(3) -> M:Matrix Integer
                                Type: Void
(4) -> f(x)=3D=3Dx+1
                                Type: Void
(5) -> g:(Integer,Float)->String
                                Type: Void
(6) -> g(x,y)=3D=3Dunparse((y^x)::InputForm)
                                Type: Void
(6) -> )display properties
Properties of % :
   Value (has type Void):  "()"
Properties of %e :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro %e () =3D=3D exp(1)
Properties of %i :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro %i () =3D=3D complex(0,1)
Properties of %infinity :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro %infinity () =3D=3D infinity()
Properties of %minusInfinity :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro %minusInfinity () =3D=3D minusInfinity()
Properties of %pi :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro %pi () =3D=3D pi()
Properties of %plusInfinity :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro %plusInfinity () =3D=3D plusInfinity()
Properties of I :
   Declared type or mode:   Integer
Properties of M :
   Declared type or mode:   Matrix Integer
Properties of S :
   Declared type or mode:   String
Properties of SF :
   This is a system-defined macro.
   macro SF () =3D=3D DoubleFloat()
Properties of f :
   This is an interpreter function.
   Definition:   f x =3D=3D x + 1
Properties of g :
   Declared type or mode:   ((Integer,Float) -> String)
   This is an interpreter function.
   This depends on the following functions or rules:
      String OutputForm concat string latex Float InputForm unparse
                                      x
   Definition:   g (x,y) =3D=3D unparse((y ) :: InputForm)

--------

>        more difficult to confuse with valid output?

Here is one way involving specifying a "frame" with a odd name
and using that name in the prompt. (Frames are separate named
workspaces.)

E.g.
---------

(1) -> )set message prompt verbose
initial [14:59:53] [1] -> )frame new <-\begin{sage-input}
<-\begin{sage-input} [15:01:04] [1] -> )set message autoload off
<-\begin{sage-input} [15:01:20] [1] -> )set output algebra off
<-\begin{sage-input} [15:01:29] [1] -> )set output tex on
<-\begin{sage-input} [15:01:56] [1] -> 1/2

$$
1 \over 2
\leqno(1)
$$

                                                       Type: Fraction
Integer
<-\begin{sage-input} [15:02:00] [2] -> integrate(sin(x)^2,x)

$$
{-{{\cos
\left(
{x}
\right)}
\  {\sin
\left(
{x}
\right)}}+x}
\over 2
\leqno(2)
$$

                                          Type: Union(Expression
Integer,...)
<-\begin{sage-input} [15:02:44] [3] ->

----------

>        the first argument?

Hmmm... I don't think so. What do you mean by "take X"? Do you
mean the type of X? But see ')display properties' output above
for functions. There is also

  )show         : show constructor information

E.g.

  )show Integer

and

  )display operations

In addtion to these standard commands it may be possible to
call some of the underlying lisp functions which are used, by
other user interfaces such as Axiom's browser HyperTex.

>=20

The usual command is

  )read filename.input

This reads interpreter commands from the named file.
There are also compiler commands which might be relevant.

  )compile filename.spad
  )compile filename.as
  )compile filename.lisp

SPAD (.spad) and Aldor (.as) are the Axiom library programming
languages.

I hope this helps.

Bill Page.=20

See http://wiki.axiom-developer.de/AxiomSources and get the 
"build-improvements" branch from sourceforge.

Then ./configure && make should do.

I hope that we will soon move to the Debian style build on all
Axiom systems.

Can you spare 6? :)

1 svn co \
  https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements
\
    axiom.build-improvements
2 cd axiom.build-improvements
3 replace gcl-2.6.8pre tarball from cvs
4 apply Camm's patchs in src/interp
5 ./configure
6 make

Let me know if you have any questions. Or take a look
at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSilverBranch

Thanks.

Bill Page.

Ralf; many thanks for taking care of this -- I'm very busy at the
moment.

Camm; I suspect Bill did not want to bother you with the
build-improvements quirks.  So, you can just grab the "trunk" of the
svn repo; that is the silver branch.

Each axiom variable has a type. If (like Martin suggests) you get all 
the operations using

    )what operations

then you could use

    )display operations zero?

(where "zero?" is just an example)
to figure out the type of (possibly several) zero? functions.
Now you have to parse the output to match the type of X with one of the 
functions. :-(  I am sure somebody can provide you with a better suggestion.

Or you just name your own frame and let Axiom show that frame name

)frame new MyFancyFrameName
)set message prompt frame

Would you like

)frame new Axiom
)set message prompt verbose

???

Yes. No so magically but fairly easily. There is a zope utility
installed on both axiom-developer and axiom.risc called ZSyncer.
This program identifies what pages have been changed at each
site and allows one to copy page two and fro until both are up
to date (and any possible conflicts are resolved).

It works pretty well. I usually have been performing the synch
about once a week, except for the last two or three weeks
because I have been making a lot of changes on axiom-developer
org and decided to freeze axiom.risc for a while I case I needed
a quick recovery path.

I was planning to perform another sync this weekend. The content
would probably look be ok without it, but I was also planning to
propagate and test the changes to the underlying Python code.

> but now I've found out that axiom.risc is not connected.

Yes. I confirm that I do not have any access to the server.
Not even network ping. So it's either dead or disconnected.

Before I take a closer look to the documentation, your description 
sounds as if I have to sync manually. I though that just using 
axiom.risc (reading/editing) would automatically (once a day or so) 
forward my changes to the axiom-developer wiki.

And what about the portal, ie the plone stuff? No no, you don't need to 
install anything if it is not there. I am just curious.

I would say that it is "semi-manual" :) It produces a two
column listing - one column for each server - with pages marked
as unchanged, new, updated or deleted on one side or the other.
All you have to do is to click check boxes to decide what you
want to do about the differences. And then click 'update' to
start the batch transfer (which can work both ways, either
updating or reverting pages as you decide).

Its not as smart as it could be and it is not completely
foolproof, but usually it doesn't take very long to move a
few hundred pages from one site to another. Only the page
source is moved. The pages must be re-rendered on the host
machine in order to generate the computational results and
the LaTeX graphics. This regeneration is transparent to the
user and occurs when the new/revised page is first requested.

ZSyncer works at the Zope level for both Axiom Wiki and Axiom
Portal. The same method is used for both.

Since I am a beginner, I don't even know how to get these two columns. 
:-( So how do I invoke ZSyncer on axiom.risc?

Hello,

There are two subsections "Layer 21" in the file
src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet. The line 1054 can be removed.

I am not sure what went wrong. Did you select those pages and
folders that you intented to update? But take care when you
do this because ZSyncer is not very bright about what it
transfers and you can easily end up transferring everything
when you did not mean to and possibily overwriting something
that you did not intend.

Unfortunately ZSyncer also has some bugs which we sometimes
have to work around. Usually I work by running ZSyncer on
axiom-developer instead of the other way around. Because of
the timezone bug this can be significant.

We are still using a slightly modified version of ZSyncer
(0.7.0). See explanation of problem here:

http://zwiki.org/1252ZWikiPageModifiedTimeWrongInDifferentTimeZones

The version in cvs at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/zsyncer

is 0.7.2 (UNRELEASED)

Maybe we want to upgrade it but we still need the patch time
zones on Zwiki pages. ZSyncer works out-of-the-box with all
other Zope objects but for some reason ZWiki pages do not
seem to conform to the current standard where times and
timezones are concerned.

My current hack works but not very well. There are still bugs
in the way that it adjusts the time and I am not (yet) skilled
enough in Zope internals to solve this problem. We really need
a more general solution to get the properly timezone adjusted
date and time for ZWiki pages. And I am still hopeful that
someone will come along and fix these problems for me. :)

> Hmm, I think, I have to learn a bit... Please help.

I think your understanding is good. It is just the tool that
is a bit faulty. I have just completed updating axiom.risc
with the new and modified pages from axiom-developer so from
the point of view of ZSyncer on axiom-developer axiom.risc
is now showing as (almost) all up to date. It might be easier
to understand what is going on with fewer changes pending.

Although the page content has been transferred, I have not
yet updated the MathAction software itself, so some of the
pages, e.g. Maxima and Sage pages, will not work the same
as on axiom-developer. I plan to complete the software part
of the upgrade to axiom.risc some time this weekend.

-----------

Here is an annotated partial transcript of my session with
ZSyncer this morning. Maybe it will help to show you how
this works. If you have any questions, just let me know.

1 At http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/manage

  Although you can work from either location, I prefer to use
  axiom-developer as the host. The reason this works out
  better this way has to do with the bugs in the timezone-based
  time comparisons. Since the axiom.risc computer is +7 hours
  from axiom-developer few pages get incorrectly flagged as
  updated. :(

2 Click  'ZSyncer (ZSyncer)'

  I have changed a few options this morning since you looked at
  it. Using the 'Filter out types' options under 'Properties'
  allows us to look at only those things that need syncing,
  ignoring the other stuff. Maybe this is make it a little less
  confusing.

3 Click ' Sync' tab

4 First sync the Axiom Portal. This is less confusing because
  the times work out properly for most Plone objects (except
  ZWiki pages in Plone :(

5 Click the 'Plone' link

6 You should also remove the checkbox next to green checkmark
  to avoid having to look at things that are already up-to-date.
  Then click 'Reload'.

7 Finally some real work to do! The blue checkboxes mean that
  something has been added to axiom.risc or deleted from
  axiom-developer - you wont know which or why until you check
  the content. If you decide it is a valid new page or if for
  some reason you need to recover this page from the axiom.risc
  backup, click the checkboxe beside the blue + (extra) for
  those items.

8 Click 'Get' to update axiom-developer from these files at
  axiom.risc or click 'Delete' to remove the file.

9 We will see messages like:

   Getting objects from server
http://page.axiom-developer.org:8080/ZSyncer
   Getting "Plone/refs/articles/aldordoc.pdf"...
   OK: Plone/refs/articles/aldordoc.pdf downloaded
   Getting "Plone/refs/articles/define.pdf"...
   OK: Plone/refs/articles/define.pdf downloaded
   ...

   Click 'Ok' to continue.

10 Rather than the blue + marks you are more likely to see the
   orange crosses and red question marks? That orange means that
   the page has been modified (one either axiom-developer or
   axiom.risc (time zone bugs notwithstanding). Red means that
   it is a new page on axiom-developer. Now you have to decide
   to use Put to transfer/update the page to axiom.risc or (maybe)
   to click Delete.

10 Now check the Axiom Wiki. Click on 'ZSyner', then the 'Sync'
   tab and the 'mathaction' link. Click the checkbox beside the
   green checkmark and click 'Reload'

  You should see at least the following:

  + 2000NewBaseIssueForRisc
  + 2001TestIssue

  These are dummy entries on axiom.risc to make sure that if someone
  creates an issue report on axiom.risc, then it will not have the
  same number as one on axiom-developer.  If there is a real issue
  report that must be move to axiom-developer, my plan is to renumber
  it at that time. They should not be moved without first renumbering.

Regards,
Bill Page.

You do a sync every week or so?

Ralf,=20

On Thursday, August 17, 2006 3:56 PM you asked:
> ...=20
> You do a sync every week or so?
>=20

Normally every Sunday evening. But sometimes I am later.
If there is an important change or set of changes,
there is no reason why one of us couldn't do it right
away. Once you get used to the tool (and it's limitations)
it doesn't seem to take long: 5 - 10 minutes.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have seen that you could even roll back changes if I make some stupid 
mistake, right?

The problem is not the 'xxx.erlib' directory as such but rather the
failure to overwrite the existing 'xxx.NRLIB' directory. Something
has changed in recent versions of Axiom, gcl or linux which prevents
the lisp function delete-file from deleting the directory.

See details:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxArrays

This is a known and annoying bug described here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/302CannotRenameTheFileErlibToNRLIB

Tim believes the problem is in GCL but Camm says that aspect of GCL
has not changed. We need to find a solution.

As a work-round to the problem perhaps we should modify Axiom to
call

  (system "rm -r xxx.NRLIB")

before the rename?

Bill Page.

What is t8?

If you look at build/scripts/document you'll find a lie that looks like

  $tangle -t8 $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE

Obviously your $tangle variable expands to nothing. Something wrong with 
  "configure", because build/scripts/document is generated during 
./configure.

Jose,

The fundamental idea we are trying to achieve is to take a pamphlet
file from an external website URL and somehow "drag-and-drop" it onto
a browser location. The paper and its embedded code should become
part of Axiom so the user can read it and use the code, perhaps in a
\begin{axiom} block.

It would be ideal if the drag-and-drop facility were not axiom specific
(or could be customized that way) so we could drag-and-drop onto any
system. That way the researcher can use any language to implement their
work. I realize that this does not benefit Axiom but the Doyen idea is
not just about Axiom, it is a science platform.

The drag-and-drop will work any way you choose to implement it.
The implementation determines a lot of what we can do. Since you've
looked at the wiki and the axiom connection you are in the best
situation to say how it should work. Since no-one knows how to do it
your work is clearly research and you get to decide everything.

Like any good research idea it will likely get adopted. The SAGE
people could clearly use such a feature, especially if they adopt
some or all of Bill's work.

Of course, once people try the feature they will have new ideas so
your first implementation will likely get additional feedback.

Please be sure to document how it works so we can build and maintain it.
Doyen is as much about documenting the process as it is about building
the CD.

looks like there is a place where a ${NOTANGLE} symbol is not defined.
the -t8 -delay are options on that command.

Camm please send me your config.log

if you don't have noweb installed, the one comming with Axiom should
be
built, and configure substitute the right value for $tangle.

This did not happen in my copy of build-improvements from
August 15. In the 'documents' script I see:

if [ "$#" = "3" ]; then
 REDIRECT=$2

Ummm, well... usually. Zope does have a general "history"
mechanism and you can usually 'undo' changes or at least
copy old versions of objects (pages) forward. But for reasons
I do not understand, replacing a copy of an object on a web
site with a newer one from another web site does not copy the
objects history :( and further it seems as if the history of
the object to which we are copying also appears to be lost.
<scary> This needs more testing but I think I would call this
a bug in Zsyncer.

A related problem is that the creation date of the copied object
gets updated. This is apparently a "known problem". But it seems
that no one is particularly active about maintaining Zsyncer.

So when using Zsyncer caution is appropriate. :)

Regards,
Bill Page.

I think what Tim is talking about is more similar to the Sage Notebook
interface than it is to MathAction. MathAction does not use a "live"
Axiom process running in the background. The only interaction with
Axiom is during 'Preview' and 'Save'.

AJAX (XMLHttpRequest etc.) might still be very useful in MathAction
however in order to reduce the network traffic during a preview
operation, for example.

This latter suggestion is possible and is very similar to the method
used by TiddlyWiki. See also Bob McElrath's version of TiddlyWiki
with the jsMath and Axiom interface.

http://bob.mcelrath.org/tiddlymath/tiddlyjsmath.html
http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath

I think that for personal use (maybe even in Doyen) this is a
very nice wiki model.

Also if you haven't already done this, I think you might find it
useful to go back and review the early part of the discussions on
the AxiomUI project with Kai Kaminski about this time last year.
Check the axiom-developer archives.

Yes. This is a good start. I am not sure whether Tim has even looked
at this. Some of his comments seem written without knowledge of that
part of your work.

Perhaps it is appropriate to ask: What else besides just copying
the source text would we want the browser to do in this case?

Tim is thinking about updating a local installation of Axiom with
some new packages, tests and other files. It seems to me that in
the current Doyen/MathAction model this is best done by the
pamphlet mechanism in the wiki server, not in JavaScript on the
browser. E.g. one might imagine adding 'Build' and 'Run' commands
to supplement the existing 'tangle' function on the Pamphlet
thumbnail page so that it also becomes a kind of collaborative
web-based IDE (which also works local as Doyen).

Again from my point of view this functionality is best implemented
on the server side, not in JavaScript.

If you choose another model like TiddlyWiki for example where there
is no "server side" then of course this would have to be done in
the browser. But this is not how Doyen works now.

I like the way you have implemented it now because it scales easily
to MathAction. We could implement your current drag-and-drop there
right now.

I would prefer additional "IDE" type commands on the pamphlet
thumbnail as I suggested above.

No, you are asking the right questions. Thank you for continuing
this work.

Thanks Tim for taking time to respond.

   Ok this is clear. I ran into a big problem right now. The ondrag (start,
end..)
   events are not implemented in Firefox :-( .

   Bug#: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112288

   Looking for a workaround now.

The paper and its embedded code should become
> part of Axiom so the user can read it and use the code, perhaps in a

 This is something that troubles me. What does it mean to become part of
 axiom.

 If you have in a pamphlet:

   \begin{axiom} integrate(sin, x) \end{axiom}

 then this command should be executed and displayed inline, similar to
 what Bill has now with

  \begin{sage}
  maxima(....)
  \end{sage}

  Now to include a file, function or something else then the right way
should be to
  use something like:

  <<newfunction>>=
   .....................
  @

   and have something similar to what the tangle button inside Mathaction
does, but
   looking for all the chunks and putting them together as one file. Maybe
this is what
   you mean to added it then to axiom (assuming that we can determine that
is axiom),
   maybe: <<newfunction.axiom>>= or <<newfunction.maxima>>= or maybe let the
user
   add the file manually.

  Understood.

The drag-and-drop will work any way you choose to implement it.

 I guess I better start writing specs and design for this, so anybody can
 give more input in a page in MathAction.

Like any good research idea it will likely get adopted. The SAGE

  I really hope so. Without feedback I feel that I am not doing the right
thing.

Please be sure to document how it works so we can build and maintain it.

  Well then I guess it should be a combination of both. The drag and drop

  more static to me in the sense that you just drag and drop a pamphlet it

  Then we can have something like SageNotebook (
http://toolbox1.sytes.net/~alfredo/axiomui/ ) or if the  efforts of adding
Axiom to Sage goes well then this can be used.

  I agree with you that the current pamphlet mechanism should be the
way to go.

  Server side it is.

  Thank you for taking time to answer my demands, I mean my questions. :-)

<a href="http://toolbox1.sytes.net/~alfredo/axiomui/">http://toolbox1.sytes.net/~alfredo/axiomui/</a> ) or if the&nbsp; efforts of adding <br>Axiom to Sage goes well then this can be used. <br><br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">

| This did not happen in my copy of build-improvements from
| August 15. In the 'documents' script I see:
| 
| [page@axiom-developer axiom.build-improvements]$ ls -l
| build/scripts/document
| -rwxrwxr-x    1 page     page          748 Aug 15 20:57
| build/scripts/document
| 
| [page@axiom-developer axiom.build-improvements]$ cat build/scripts/document
| #!/bin/sh
| latex=latex
| tangle=notangle
| weave=noweave

This is because configure found:
   * latex in your build environment
   * noweb in your build environment

and consequently substituted those values in src/scripts/document.in,
producing build/scripts/document.

src/scripts/document.in reads

    #!/bin/sh
    latex=@LATEX@
    tangle=@NOTANGLE@
    weave=@NOWEAVE@

    if [ "$#" = "3" ]; then
     REDIRECT=$2
     FILE=`basename $3 .pamphlet`
     $tangle -t8 $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE

OK, I got it.  You don't noweb in your environement.  That is OK.
However, for some reasons, NOTANGLE and NOWEAVE are not set to
point to those build as part of Axiom.  That is weird because, you
configure.ac should have these lines

-----------------
axiom_use_noweb=
AC_ARG_WITH([noweb], [assume noweb is present in the build environment],
            [case $withval in
                yes|no) axiom_use_noweb=$withval ;;
                *) AC_MSG_ERROR([erroneous value for --with-noweb]) ;;
             esac])

## Check for notangle and noweb if we are not explicitly told
## to build noweb from Axiom sources.
if test x$axiom_use_noweb != xno; then
    AC_CHECK_PROG([NOTANGLE], [notangle], [notangle])
    AC_CHECK_PROG([NOWEAVE], [noweave], [noweave])

    ## Ensure the build environment is consistent with specified option.
    if test x$axiom_use_noweb = xyes \
        && test -z $NOTANGLE -o -z $NOWEAVE; then
        AC_MSG_ERROR([noweb utils are missing but --with-noweb is specified])
    fi
## Otherwise, either noweb is missing from the build environment or
## we are told not to check.  In both cases, we do need noweb; so
## tell the Makefiles to build one and use it.

    NOTANGLE=$axiom_build_bindir/notangle

Greetings, and thanks!  I'm just after Bill's directoryp relocation
error at the moment, and have a ton of other items on the plate.  What
should I do to work around to reproduce Bill's bug?

Take care,

Kai Kaminski is still hear on this email list (I think). Probably
currently interested in different things. Last I heard he was
preparing a version of the hyperdoc content for browsing in
HTML format. I recall seeing an earlier version of this that
looked quite nice but I haven't heard anything more about it
lately.

The source code that Kai produced during the SoC project is
available in the tla archive. I have looked at it only briefly,
first to test that it worked as claimed on linux and then
(with a little more frustration) at trying to get it to run
on Windows - which writing it in Clisp was supposed to make
possible, but didn't .. :(

No one else has taken up the task of extending and completing
the AxiomUI work. One of the results of the this work that
would be very nice to have even without completing the rest
of the user interface is the kind external program interface
like the one done for Maxima. This would make interfacing with
Axiom much easier for MathAction and any other program that
wants to use Axiom.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Greetings!

This one I believe is machine specific -- can I log in and reproduce?
(is this axiom-developer.org?)

In general, the easiest way for me to fix these things is to work with
a build atop GCL configured with --enable-debug.  If anyone has the
time to produce such a build somewhere and confirm that the error
persists, then point me to it, we can take care of this in short
order.  I realize that everyeon else's time is also limited, so if
this is not possible please so state.

Take care,

Bill any idea what is this:

vp1:=draw(sin(x), x=%pi/10..%pi)
   >> System error:
  (SYSTEM "gcc -c -Wall -DVOL=volatile -fsigned-char -pipe

I get this error if I try to do:

\begin{axiom}
vp1:=draw(sin(x), x=%pi/10..%pi)

That is using the binaries files of Axiom from MathAction:

yes, that may solve his immediate issue.  However, while I understand
how his build is failing, I don't understand how he got there.
My builds are OK.  How are yours, except the GCL issue?

I am not having any problems with the build process but I
have not tried to build without having noweb pre-installed.
I could do it later if you like. Maybe someone else can
report on their experience?

Bill,

Probably this has come out many times in previous discussions.
Given the latex output from Axiom, what would be the best way to
display it on a webpage.

Complete as latex document -> latex -> dvipng???

or how is it done on MathAction?

Regards,

JAPP

Greetings!

OK, this one is my fault, as I fogot we were still using EXTRAS in the
makefile here.  2.6.8pre incorporates Gordon Novak's xgcl, and the way
I build it was using compiler::link from within lisp as it was
simpler.  This overrides EXTRAS at the very end, as it copies the
compiler::link generated saved_xgcl over the saved_gcl left by
unixport/makefile.

I'll probably have to revert this and do xgcl the old fashioned way.
In the meantime, --disable-xgcl should work.  Please let me know if
not. 

Take care,

Alfredo,

On August 18, 2006 2:27 PM you asked:

I used to have a simple test harness that read in some test
page source from a file and called ReplaceInlineAxiom. That is
very simple but you have to comment-out any reference to the
Zope environment (one one case I think). If you like, I can
take a look for it and send you a copy.

But now that I have tried iPython interactive shell for Python
- motivated by the fact that Sage uses a customized version of
iPython for it's command line interpreter - I would say that
is definitely a better way to fly!

Not that I know of. Almost a year ago! I did try running Axiom
inside fbrun and it seemed to work as I described. This is one
of those projects that I was hoping to get to real-soon-now. :)

> Is any more information you could provide me?

Hmmm... Well as I recall I did get so far as installing X-windows
with Xfbdev on axiom-developer.org but its been too long since
I did anything with this so I don't recall much more about it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb

More later, gotta run.

that would be definitely helpful.

I tried to set up a cron job to mail results to axiom-testresults but
at the moment, the build log is just too large for SF mailers to
handle :-(

Maybe we should open up a Wiki and call for people on the FrontPage 
similar to the FreeAldor link.

I believe that some research is involved here. I would definitely like 
to see better support in the language to state the input-output 
conditions in formal terms that could be used by a theorem prover.
If that just appears in the comments it is lost for checking program 
correctness.

Axiom is really big, may I ask on which part of Axiom do you want to 
concentrate?

In my eyes Aldor is/should become one of the most important pieces in 
Axiom. The mathematical knowledge that is hidden in all the SPAD 
domains, must be rewritten in Aldor and in a pamphlet style.

The availability of manpower is a big question mark for a second 
implementation of Aldor.

but, such a new compiler would have to reinvent everything from
scratch.  A lot have been done in recent years in terms for dependent
types (Nurpl, epigram, etc.), functional languages implementations
techniques and optimizations (OCaml, Haskell, etc.).  Furthermore
it may attract more students.  

Of course, that is not said to underestimate the task; just to remind
that not everything has to be reinvented.

Well, it's Friday night and I decided to take a first look at doing
some Dimension related stuff in Aldor.  So I don't flounder uselessly
about, could someone guide me to the right things to read to answer the
following?

1)  For anyone who has slogged through the old draft of the units
paper, you know some of the problems with defining the ideas of basic
and derived dimensions.  I may be a little off course here, but this is
what I'm thinking:

a)  A basic dimension cannot be multiplied and remain a basic dimension
- the result is always a derived dimension.

b)  A derived dimension is always defined in terms of one or more basic
definitions and uses the multiplicative operator both in its definition
and its exported function.

So we have two types of dimension - the BasicDimension, and the
DerivedDimension.  The multiplication rules are:

basic * basic -> derived
basic * derived -> derived
derived * derived -> derived

However, derived / derived MIGHT yield a basic dimension, e.g.
Force*Acceleration/Length -> Mass.  Is there a way to conditionalize
the type of the output?  (BTY, the dimension 1 is always assumed part
of the set of basic dimensions).

I'm also looking at a bit of a problem with definitions.  If I do
something like this for BasicDimension (I suppose I'm writing this
wrong):

BasicDimension: Abelian with {
  "*": (%,%) -> DerivedDimension
}
== add {
	Rep = Record(name : String, definition : String, system : String)
}

DerivedDimension is undefined at this stage, because (presumably) part
of the representation of DerivedDimension is going to have to be
defined in terms of some kind of Abelian Polynomial of Basic
Dimensions.  Am I thinking about this incorrectly?

Unfortunately the difficulties don't stop there - some DerivedDimension
in the SI system have no definitive definition in terms of
BasicDimensions, so some DerivedDimensions will have to have parts of
their structure undefined.  I'm not quite sure how to do this - I'm
floundering around:

DerivedDimension: Abelian with{
  "*": (%,%) -> %
}
==add {
  D == BasicDimension Polynomial
        Rep = Record(name: String, definitiverepresentation : D,
reducedrepresentation : D)
  x * y  == if (x::Rep).definitiverepresentation = "" then
[(x::Rep).name::DerivedDimension * (y::Rep).definitiverepresentation]
else if (x::Rep).definitiverepresentation = "" then
[(x::Rep).definitiverepresentation * (y::Rep).name::DerivedDimension]
else [(x::Rep).definitiverepresentation *
(y::Rep).definitiverepresentation]
} 

Anyway.  Any advice appreciated.

Thanks,
CY

I beg your pardon, that should be Force*Time*Time/Length -> Mass.  Been
a long day.

Hi Cliff,

if I think about dimensions then that is a multiplicative structure. In 
fact, to me it looks like a commutative group where the free generators 
are the basic SI dimensions.

So an implementation would be

Dimension: with {
     *: (%, %) -> %;
     /: (%, %) -> %;
     kilogramm: %;
     meter: %;
     second: %;
     ...
} == add {
     Rep == Array Integer;
     import from Rep;
     -- Suppose we have n basic units then the array would ALWAYS be
     -- of length n. For simplicity I set n = 4;
     local new(): Rep == per new(4, 0); -- create array of size 4
     kilogram: % == {x := new(); x.1 := 1; per x}
     meter: %    == {x := new(); x.2 := 1; per x}
     second: %   == {x := new(); x.3 := 1; per x}
     (x: %) * (y: %): % == per [xx+yy for xx in rep x for yy in rep y];
     (x: %) / (y: %): % == per [xx-yy for xx in rep x for yy in rep y];
     ...
}

You can easily recognize if your dimension is a basic unit by just 
running through the array and testing whether there is exactly ONE 1.

Why would you want anything else? Can you give an explicit pointer to 
the text you have already written about units and dimensions?

If you like, you could change the representation to allow infinitely 
many basic dimensions (= infinitely many variables).

Your suggestion

 > BasicDimension: Abelian with {
 >   "*": (%,%) -> DerivedDimension
 > }
 > == add {
 >   Rep = Record(name : String, definition : String, system : String)
 > }

looks completely unnatural to me.

How would you ever define * explicitly?

To me it looks more like you define a box that contains name and 
definition of the dimension, but no multiplicative structure. Remove the 
* signature. That would appear in DerivedDimension anyway.

And if you want BasicDimension, just add an exponent entry to your 
representation

Rep = Record(exponent: Integer,
              name : String,
              definition : String,
              system : String)

and change my representation to

Rep == Array BasicDimension;

(And of course adapt the functions.)

Can you give an example.

Looking at your code, I find it unreadable. And if that is the case one 
should clearly think about another way of doing it.

And I cannot follow why you would like "Polynomial" to appear. Is there 
a dimension that looks like

   4*m^2 + 5*kg/s

???

The thing is, different systems may have different basic dimensions -
they are not universal.

Yes - it is incomplete, but there is a pdf here:

Probably not necessary, but different systems will have different
numbers of basic dimensions.  I think SI actually has one of the
largest.

Not surprising.  This is also my first foray into Aldor coding, and I'm
not familiar enough with what's there in Axiom to know how to build
this :-(.  However, I see no remedy to that but to try.

Hmm - that might work.  I was stuck thinking that a dimension to a
power is a different physical property.  Is time^2 a derived dimension
since it isn't in the array of basic dimensions as time^2, but just
time?

It is discussed in the paper - the primary difficulty revolves around
derived dimensions incorporating radians.

Heh - I'm looking for A way to do it.  That was just pseudocode at
best.

Actually, there will be some cases with a derived dimension not being
simplifiable directly to basic dimensions where such expressions might
arise.  In a system with no definition issues for derived dimensions
the answer would be no, but unfortunately that's not the situation with
SI.  For example, the distinction between Work and Moment of Force
cannot be expressed in terms of basic SI dimensions.  So they cannot be
added to either each other or a basic dimensional expression containing
their "definition", because that definition is not unique.  It's
discussed more in the writeup.

Cheers, and thanks!

Cliff

I don't get that error on Axiom Developer. See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxAxiom#bottom

The "gazonk" files are temporary files created by the gcl lisp
compiler. I presume that the lisp compiler is being called to
compile the function 'sin(x)' prior to using it to generate the
data for the graph (which makes more sense of course if the
function to be plotted is more complex than in this example).

Anyway, the Axiom interpreter (all of Axiom for that matter) is
implemented in gcl and because this is lisp that means that it
*is* gcl plus the code that implements the interpreter. So Axiom/gcl
converts 'sin(x)' into a lisp function and then tries to compile
it into machine code. To do that it first generates C code
(gazonk1.c) and then calls gcc. The system error that you see
above is due to a failure of the C compile. I do not know the
cause but I think you might get this kind of error if no gcc
compiler is available. Or some other basic problem in your system.
But I would not expect any gcc compiler failure for lisp generated
from expressions as simple as 'sin(x)'.

This whole gazonk temporary file thing is not particularly well
done in the current version of gcl (especially in the case of
multi-user systems) because of possible race conditions while
generating unique temporary file names and there have been some
discussions on the gcl-devel list about replacing it with a linux
operating system standard method for tmp files.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have taken another look at this and I think there is indeed a
problem with gazonk files here. On the axiom-developer server when
I run the above commmand I do not get any problem. On the other
hand after the Axiom session is ended there is still a in /tmp
file named 'gazonk0.fn'

  # ls -l /tmp

-rw-r--r--    1 plone    plone         352 Aug 18 21:09 gazonk0.fn

I think this is the so called "proclaim" file for the compiled
function that contains information about the data types used in
the lisp function (but my understanding of gcl may be so good, so
don't count on these details). Anyway, I think this temporary file
should have been deleted by gcl.

I am using Axiom built from current sources in June 2006 with the
gcl-2.6.8pre source from that Axiom distribution.

Notice that it is owned by user plone and has some write limitations.

Later if I try this axiom command while logged in as a different
user I get the error message:

>> System error:
   Cannot create the file /tmp/gazonk0.fn.

And after that there are even more files left in /tmp

-bash-2.05b# ls -l /tmp
-rw-rw-r--    1 page     page       163098 Aug 18 21:52 gazonk0.c
-rw-rw-r--    1 page     page          100 Aug 18 21:52 gazonk0.data
-rw-r--r--    1 plone    plone         352 Aug 18 21:09 gazonk0.fn
-rw-rw-r--    1 page     page          232 Aug 18 21:52 gazonk0.h
-rw-rw-r--    1 page     page          112 Aug 18 21:52 gazonk0.lsp

If I remove the file '/tmp/gazonk0.fn' this error goes away.

BTW, because of this error we can actually see the lisp code that was
generated by the Axiom interpreter:

-bash-2.05b# cat /tmp/gazonk0.lsp

(lisp::defun boot::%a (boot::|x|)
  (lisp::declare (lisp::float boot::|x|))
  (boot::c-to-r (lisp::sin boot::|x|)))

------

The C code generated by gcl was a lot longer so I wont include it
here. :)

Bill Page.

Camm,

Thanks Camm! My test build just completed using the option

--disable-xgcl

I am not sure that it continues to make sense to support the old
"EXTRAS" method of linking external libraries. Does any gcl-based
software use this besides the "standard" Axiom distribution? Since
this method is not used of Axiom on Debian and on BSD, I think it
would make sense to move as soon as possible to using compiler::link
on all the other systems.

Is there any advantage to enabling xgcl in Axiom in any case? Would
it change Axiom's user interface? Have you tried this on the Debian
build where it does not have to be disabled?

It did. Thanks again.

Bill Page.

Bill,

In http://toolbox1.sytes.net/~alfredo/axiomui/

is any way to keep the Axiom session open in a server side script.

With this I mean, when I call axiom, I open a FILE stream and call
certain functions in Axiom and get the result like this:

In perl, I am doing something like this:

open (FILE, "| /usr/bin/AXIOMsys >/tmp/axiom");
print FILE ")set output tex on\n";
print FILE ")set output algebra off\n";
print FILE ")set message autoload off\n";
print FILE ")set message type off\n";
print FILE $question;

however after the script finishes, the session too. So if you input a
command after
it doesn't know about the previous calculation, like you can do inside Sage.

Is there a way to do this in python??? or any other language?

Regards,

JAPP

of course, if it were written in lisp and assumed the axiom system
underneath it then it is a much less complex problem.

Bear in mind, that you are trying to rewrite an existing product.
IANAL and I do not know French/British/Canadian law.
But I have been reading several traits of US law (which I have been told  
to be not too different from Canadian law).
According to my understanding of US law, someone who has seen Aldor source  
code cannot work on rewriting Aldor (without explicit permission by those  
who hold the rights of the Aldor source code).
I am not sure, to what extend the US law situation is reflected by  
Canadian, French or British law.
However, as (I guess) most of the ppl interested in Aldor, have seen the  
compiler's source code, they (probably) should not work on the  
reimplementation of it.

This is not some funny side remark of myself, but a real issue. Just think  
about the pain ReactOS is going through.

Kind regards,
Christian

Quite a nice introduction to that stuff so far. I appreciate it.

But I very much wonder, why you don't give proper references. A 
bibliography is completely missing. With all you literature review I 
would have expected that. Also the systems should be cited properly by 
giving links to their respective homepages.

That critisism is, however, not my main concern now.

In section 4.2.2 I read

[u1]<U>
------- = 1<1>
[u1]<U>

[u1]<U>   [u1]          1
------- = ----<1> = --------<U>^2
[u2]<U>   [u2]      f(u1,u2)

The latter <U>^2 must be a spelling error. If you really mean that, then 
I cannot follow anymore. Shouldn't it be <1>?

Hi Cliff,

At the end of section 4.4.2 of
http://portal.axiom-developer.org/Members/starseeker/axiomunit_diagramtest.pdf/download
where you have discussed the problem of curvature, you say that the SI 
system is not a perfect one and that it is missing a dimension of 
<CircularCurvature>.

At the same time you say:

   Unfortunately, Axiom must work with systems as they exist and are used
   rather than than their ideal implementations, we must somehow allow
   the current fundamental disodance to exist in Axiom's SI definitions
   and function non the less.

I understand your wish, but to my taste that is a non-mathematical 
approach. As you have described, expressed in the SI base dimensions, 
<Work> and <Momentum of Force> are indistinguishable. So why would you 
want to implement an imperfect system? If there is nothing in SI that 
helps you to distinguish <Work> and <Momentum of Force> then you cannot 
express it. You are basically saying that the SI system is 
7-dimensional, but the world is 8-dimensional (or even 
higher-dimensional), but you want to describe your world with 7 
dimensions. That with fewer dimensions you don't see everything is 
clear---draw a 4-dimensional hypercube on a sheet of (two-dimensional) 
paper and try to figure out from the latter, what properties the 4-dim 
object has. Of course, impossible.

So if I were to implement dimensions and units, I would design a perfect 
system and allow the user to add dimensions and work with them. 
Depending on which system the user chooses, he/she can work with 
<CircularCurvature> or leave it out. Such an open system would even 
enable one to experiment whether <CircularCurvature> is the right concept.

In the SI-system plus <CircularCurvature> you could distinguish <Work> 
and <Momentum of Force> in the pure SI system you cannot.

All I want to say, forget about the nature and all those systems like SI 
and cgs or whatever. In Axiom you should build a system that is flexible 
enough to accomodate for any system you like. If, for example, you want 
to replace the "fundamental dimension" <Length> by <Force>, then that is 
possible mathematically and should be allowed by Axiom. <Length> is then 
simply a "derived dimension" that depends on the "fundamental 
dimensions" <Force>, <Time>, and <Mass>. Where would be the problem? As 
a mathematician I can choose any axioms (fundamental things) I like as 
long as they are non-contradicting. Maybe a physicist thinks differently 
here?

By the way, if I look at section 4.2.2, then that very much suggests 
that the *type* of a unit is a *dimension*.
To my taste, that suggests to implement 7 (or 8 or how many dimensions 
you like) dimension domains:

Length: Dimension == add {
   Rep == -- I don't yet know.
   meter: % == ...
   inch: % == ...
   ...
}

or you don't hardcode meter, inch etc., but make those units dynamic.
Similar domains for other dimensions.

I could even imagine something like

Length(u: Unit): Dimension == add {
    Rep == Unit;
    unit: Unit == ...
}

where out of the many units that are possible for lengths units, u would 
be the reference unit for this dimension. (So you could have the SI 
system and cgs system easily by using the Length constructor with a 
different unit.

I don't yet have a good idea for the domain Unit, though. :-(
Please don't take all this too serious, I am just thinking aloud.

Once you have these dimension domains, you could form an algebra with 
them, ehm, a abelian group, of course. No, no, there are still no 
coefficients. So with that "abelian group" you cannot express 3m or 6s. 
All you could do is to express, what you probably called "derived 
dimensions". So Length, Length*Time^(-1) etc. are examples for such 
monomials. As you see, each "fundamental dimension" is then also a 
"derived dimension", but no conversions would be possible, since you 
don't have coefficients.

Now, having the monomials, you can think about quantities (= units (as 
elements of dimensions) together with numbers).

I don't have a well developed idea of how I would implement what I am 
writing about here, but it reminds me a bit of what I am currently doing 
in aldor-combinat. There we define combinatorial species (which are 
endo-functors from the category of finite sets and isomorphisms to 
itself. They are implemented as domain constructors in Aldor, but as the 
theory goes, one can form a semi-ring where species would be the 
elements. This is in so far similar to what I was writing about above as 
I like dimensions to be domains. But later on you should be able to 
multiply together such domains.

Another remark concerns dimensional analysis... If in Axiom dimensions 
are implemented as types, couldn't then the dimensional analysis be done 
by the compiler? Types on the right and left hand side must match. What 
about thinking along these lines for implementing dimensions in Axiom?

Maybe some day I'll find time to code my ideas into Aldor which would 
then be open for criticism.

Ralf

Yes, I know.  I am working on a bibliography - that was why I did the
MSC2000 and PACS work earlier.  I wanted to have the "final" Axiom
system in place and integrate my bibliography properly with that.  As
you know we don't (yet) have a final solution to that, and I tried to
push towards something that could be a final solution before building
my final bibliography.  Unfortunately, in all that, I didn't get proper
references into the units paper yet.  As I said earlier it's
unfinished, and when it IS finished it will be properly cited.

Er, yes - that's a typo.  Thanks for spotting it!

In principle, I agree with you.  The reason I want to work with the
"real" SI system as such is basically that the scientific community
seems to be very accustomed to radians having dimension 1, but treating
Work and Moment of Force as two different dimensions.  In my opinion
this is a flaw of the system, but I wanted to be very "correct" about
implimenting the actual true-to-life SI system in order to cultivate
the interest of the scientific community in Axiom.  Now to be fair I
think most other tools that deal with this type of issue HAVE
introduced angle as a dimension, so perhaps that isn't so outlandish a
solution after all.  I guess the nagging question in my mind is whether
I (who am not formally trained in this stuff beyond a BS in Physics)
should presume to second guess the SI committee.  Finding the other
papers discussing that helped.  Maybe the thing to do is use the NIST
publication as the basis of a literate document implementation of the
SI system on top of the eventual Unit/Dimension framework, and update
it there with some of this discussion.

Yes.  My impression is that because radian is an accepted unit in SI,
it is convenient for people solving for things like length using these
quantities to multiply by the numerical constant and ignore the
curvature aspect of the problem - in the end this is usually safe
because the radian multiplicative factor takes care of things, and
there is a "de-facto" curvature dimensional correction at the same
time.  I guess most people don't worry about the SI dimensional set
without thinking about the units as well, which masks the problem.  Heh
- maybe we can petition the SI committee to fix this issue - I wonder
what the procedure is :-).

In the framework I'm thinking about this would be done by defining a
custom System, using these steps:

1.  Define as BasicDimensions your desired BasicDimensions for the new
system (that's why the BasicDimension definition needs a system slot -
whether a dimension is Basic or not depends entirely on what system it
is being used in.)

2.  Define your named DerivedDimensions using the BasicDimensions,
again specifying the System.

3.  I don't know if the System needs to be explicitly defined or not -
probably.  But it will need existing Basic and named Derived dimensions
defined for it.

Yes.

Absolutely.  But in order to make sure it IS flexible enough, my
approach was to look at a use case and see what features and structure
are needed.  It get's a bit weird - for example, to handle some high
energy physics unit systems the only thing that is axiomatic are some
dimensionless constants!  I'm still not quite sure how to handle that
one.

Absolutely, but then you are no longer working in the SI system.  To do
this (which I agree should be allowed) you need to create your own
system.  If you use the SI system, it will enforce SI as defined by the
NIST Special Publication, give or take the CircularCurvature issue.

There wouldn't be - I agree this should be doable.  Just not in the SI
system - that would be MyNewSystem or some such.

In principle, no.  In practice, the SI definitions will be used in
almost all situations, except in cases where units from other system
need to be converted to SI.  But Axiom should be able to handle any
legally possible combination of setups correctly.

Yes, that's what I was thinking.  Something kind of along the lines of:

Length: BasicDimension == add{
     Rep == Record{name : String, system : String}
}

Meter : Unit == add{
     Rep == Record{name : String, system : String, physdef : String,
                   dimension : Length, pivotunit : Unit}
     convert: %,% == something
     etc...
}
> Similar domains for other dimensions.

Right - each dimension gets defined once for each system.  So for each
large scale built in system, we would have a pamphlet which uses the
core structural pamphlet defining things like BasicDimension and Unit,
and the specifics (Length, Meter, etc.) would be in the system
pamphlets.  There will also need to be some kind of Conversion pamphlet
that Axiom uses to know how to go from cgs->SI - I'm not sure how to
handle that yet.  Planck -> SI is going to be interesting.

That's an interesting idea.  The thing is though, I can envision a case
where someone wants to define just a Dimensional system with no Unit
component defined, in order to do dimensional analysis (which does not
involve units.)  Maybe optionally specifying a unit?

On the contrary, this is excellent!  It's exactly the kind of thinking
needed and that I'm not nearly expert enough in Aldor to do yet.

I'm afraid I didn't pick an easy topic for a first topic in Axiom,
despite what I thought earlier - because these ideas are so fundamental
to all scientific computation it is crucial to get them right the first
time, and mapping them into Axiom's systems takes some serious
thinking.

Right.

That's where I get in trouble.  (Well, one of the places.)  Length IS
basic in the SI system, but Length/Time is a different dimension from
Length OR Time and is not basic.  It's COMPOSED of basic dimensions,
but that could be said of every derived dimension in a complete system.

I don't quite follow.  Length and Time are basic all right, but
Length/Time is a single derived dimension.  That's why I was originally
trying to say that if you multiply two basic dimensions (or take one to
a power, or divide - ANY such operation) the result is not a basic
dimension but a derived dimension.  However, Length/Time^2 * Time^2 is
composed of two derived dimensions - Length/Time^2 and Time^2 - but
will simplify to a basic dimension.  I was thinking some kind of
conditional definition of type output for those operators - if the
resulting dimensional expression is in the basic dimensions list for
the system, return type BasicDimension, else the result is a
DerivedDimension.  I'm sure I wrote crazy pseudocode trying to express
that, but I don't really see a way around it.  Derived Dimension almost
needs a generic Dimension type which can be either a BasicDimension or
a DerivedDimension, since either can be used to define a
DerivedDimension.  DerivedDimension is a bit recursive - a
DerivedDimension can be defined using DerivedDimensions.

Makes sense.

Right.  Dimensional analysis would require that ability, as does
defining derived dimensions.

Yes, that is an interesting way to go - it would mean that equations
defined using dimensions could be checked as dimensionally correct
before they are ever used (that's one of the ideas I REALLY like about
a dimensional system in Axiom - any equation properly defined using the
units and dimensions system could be guaranteed to be dimensionally
correct.  Not a guarantee that the formula is correct of course, but it
would catch certain types of conceptual errors.)  I was hoping to get
this more or less for free from Axiom's domain/type systems - does it
require extra work?

That would be great!  I'm trying to think about this in order to make
the units paper something more than just an idea exposition (i.e. make
it a real pamphlet) but as Tim says there is no such thing as a simple
job.  This is compounded by being somewhat different from "typical"
mathematical programming in Axiom.

Cheers, and thanks again.

I think what Ralf meant is that the *derived* dimensions form a group, not the
basic dimensions.

No, the concept here is called "retract". You'd have an operation

retractIfCan: DerivedDimension -> Union("failed", BasicDimension)

(I know, Ralf, that you hate that return type, but so far we don't have
Partial...)

just as an operation

coerce: BasicDimension -> DerivedDimension

In Axiom there are categories for these operations, by the way.

OK; so let's me summarize a candidate patch for axiom.silver or
axiom.build-improvements:

   * apparently, GCL 2.6.8pre from CVS has more improvements;
   * if we grab that, we must patch Axiom with patches suggested by 
     Camm.  Camm, could you give me a list of those?
   * We must, for the moment, configure GCL with --disable-xgcl.

Is that correct?

It would be difficult for me to find good and motivated students

I never touched/saw Aldor compiler source code.  

I'm not trying to rewrite the existing compiler.  I'm only interested
in a new compiler for the *Aldor language*.  If the *Aldor language*
is defined to be the behaviour of its *current compiler*, then we are
all in trouble.

But have you tried the slightly modified file (see attachment).
I simply have removed the Q... macros. ;-)

Anyway that is a very good example why pile syntax is terrible.

Right, and as such they must form a domain where all the group 
operations are implemented. Informally, one can think of that domain (of 
"derived dimension") as a container that has as its elements 
powerproducts (negative powers allowed) of BasicDimensions.

I somehow have a slight feeling that the trouble comes when the design 
should be such that the compiler is doing the dimension analysis. For 
that we have to think a bit whether it is possible at all.

Sorry, but I really don't quite understand, why one would need such a 
retract at all. But maybe I'll learn more while implementing something 
and getting feedback.

Martin, you are right. ;-)

Thanks all for taking the time to think about this.  If we are going to
go ahead and use CircularCurvature as a basic dimension, (e.g. insist
on a complete system definition before implementing it in Axiom) then
that (greatly) simplifies the needed structure for dimensional
definitions.  I'm going to proceed to update the text part of the paper
and clean out a lot of the workaround discussions, and I'll also try
and get a units bibliography going (we can always update it later to
meet final conventions, I suppose - sigh.)  I'll upload it to the
portal once I've got something reasonable.

Cheers, and thanks again.

Cliff

Ralf, I am sorry but your comment makes be rather angry. :(
I cannot understand why an otherwise very intelligent
programmer would blame the language for how a compiler
handles a syntax error. Arrrgh!

(: Of course I mean this a the spirit of friendly criticism... :)

In my opinion the notation without the {}; decoration is still
superior even when the compiler writers get it wrong. There are
several other instances when SPAD does not consistently implement
the language.

If you compile this in #pile mode in Aldor you get the expected
result.

I hope you have some mercy with me. But I cannot believe that you find 
that code easily readable.

Is it so obvious for the untrained eye that the indentation of the line 
after the _ is irrelevant? (Actually, I don't know this rule by heart.)
What if the line "Exports == Implementation where" were a bit longer so 
that you have to break it again with _? How much would you indent this 
third line then?

I agree that in some cases #pile mode might look nice, but I turned away 
from it long ago (because of code like the above).

Sorry that I posted my personal opinion. Important for me is that code 
should be easily readable (whether pile or not) and for that we should 
introduce some style conventions. (I have mine for non-pile mode more or 
less encoded in aldor-mode.el. But if more people start programming in 
Aldor I'll probably start a Wikipage about style conventions.)

Ralf

Sorry for re-opening this debate again but....

Having lived with Spad code for years I consider pile syntax to be
the biggest mistake the language designers made so I clearly come
down on Ralf's side of the game.

Even the trivial case of sending code in email that has proportional
font makes the code unreadable. Moving a function from one place to
another within a file can cause mistakes. I had the task of making
many global changes to the algebra code. I could not write an emacs
macro to walk across the files because the insertions were sensitive
to spaces.

Modifications to files in a single line can cause semantic errors
many, many lines away. And adding a line requires that you take
the global syntax of the file into account.

Spaces cannot be counted visually and lead to THE most common
SEMANTIC mistake made in Spad. Fortran made the same mistake
but at least the punched cards had explicit column numbers. Once
the design error was explored with Fortran it should have been
forever banned. I've never forgiven Make for the tab character mistake.
If we are going to count spaces we might as well add line numbers.

What possible advantage can piles claim?

Since the Axiom developers are in such remote geographic locations, I
was wondering if there was/is any interest in having an online meeting
in the axiom IRC channel.  I have seen this done occasionally for other
projects and it would be less expensive for those of us who can't
attend the odd in-person meeting.

The trick, of course, is to get a time which works for everyone, but
presumably some something could be worked out.  Is that of any
interest/potential use?

Cheers,
CY

I suppose we could work out a scheduled time for "group meetings".
I'm usually online all day and late into the night but a scheduled
time would make it reasonable. I have not been monitoring the IRC
channel because the beta version of Gaim cannot handle the IRC helper
plugin. I just downgraded my version of Gaim and now it works.

CY, Kai, and I discussed line-breaking on the IRC channel
and the point was raised that line-breaking involves breaking
the equation into chunks that mean something to the viewer.

the axiom way to handle this would be the same method we use
during simplification. in simplification we format
  POLYNOMIAL(FRACTION(INT))
different from
  FRACTION(POLYNOMIAL(INT))

so perhaps we need output routines that format
  SUM(PRODUCT(X,Y))
different from
  PRODUCT(SUM(X,Y))

and other format domains. each would do line-breaking in
different places using different rules.

Well, I find the pile stuff a terrible language feature.

Hmmm... 20,000 Python programmers? ;)

http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm

(Actually it seems no one really knows how many people program
in any given language but the statistics do show some languages
becoming more popular and others declining.) My point is that a
large number of programmers do use Python and the number is
increasing.

Contrary to my philosophy on a number of other issues, I do
believe that there are very significant advantages in numbers
in open source programming. After all, what is the limiting
resource in almost every open source project? People.

One of my *first* reactions on learning to program in SPAD was
"Hey, this looks a lot like Python!"

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-10/msg00109.htm=
l

So quite contrary to the opinion Tim Daly stated in a much earlier
email, I do not believe that Python (and it's programming style)
does not seem likely to disappear any time soon. And more over,
now we find the newest and fastest growing open source computer
algebra project ever - Sage - was largely motivated by and
incorporates Python in it's basic machinery both internally and
at the user interface level (iPython).

----------

But it's an old debate alright. Using indentation to represent
(not just document) program structure was in fact proposed by
Donald Knuth and several others 46 years ago!

http://jeremyhylton.blogspot.com/2006/06/using-indentation-to-represent-p=
rog
ram.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule

http://foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?off-side+rule

The popularity of Python re-ignited this debate.

Myths about Indentation
http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk

But there are some well known languages other than Python use
indentation for program structure (notably: Haskell).

http://home.tiac.net/~cri/2001/indentation.html

http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs2112/langdes/indent.html

In my opinion SPAD and Aldor #pile syntax was not a mistake -
it was just implementing yet another important idea in
programming language design, way before it's time.

Regards,
Bill Page.

That is hardly a conclusive argument.

well, given TeX's syntax, I would not claim his language syntax design

yes, and I hate it.  Two months ago I wasted whole day chasing a
bug in one of my Haskell programs, only to discover that it was an
identation issue in an instance declaration.  That bug happened after
reformating a correct, working, program.  It is a misfeature.

Well, I'm not a developer, but I like IRC meetings. The best deal on
time zones is probably something early morning Saturday Pacific (US)
time. This gives the folks who work full time a chance to get some rest,
and just about everyone else is in some part of the weekend.

I'm not a big fan of Gaim for IRC -- either XChat or KVIrc has a much
better interface. XChat is a good bit lighter in weight, if that matters.

I assume the "you" does not refer to me, but someone having seen the  
compiler sources.
The term "technical question" is rather vague to me in this context.
Up to my knowledge, people having seen the compiler sources may do only  
one thing (in the US): Write specifications.

I've added most of the references used so far to the Unit paper and put
up a new version here: 
http://portal.axiom-developer.org/Members/starseeker/axiomunit-current.pdf/download

Haven't had time to rework the dimension and unit definitions section
yet.

Just for some more fun, this is using the eprint.sty system to add some
hyperlinks to the bibliography (when available.)

Cheers,
CY

Agreed. I do not know of any conclusive argument one way or the
other. All I wish to point out is that the statements made by you,
Tim, and Ralf about #pile syntax is based only on personal bias
and not on fact.

My reference to 20,000 programmers was in relationship to my
desire that programming in Axiom should be made to seem appealing
to the "next generation". I think associating Axiom (and Aldor in
#pile mode) with Python and Haskell via the (admittedly somewhat
superficial) resemblance of their syntax might be one small PR
step in that direction.

I think your argument is not strengthened when you choose to argue
with spectacular success. If Knuth had invented MathML in the 1970's
instead of TeX do you think he would be so widely known today? ;)

Get serious! Your experience is at best only anecdotal. Programmers
have collectively sent many days chasing bugs due to misplaced ;
and logic errors hidden by meaninglessly indented code. I don't know
what you mean by "reformatting a correct, working program" but if
your "reformatting" involved changing indentation, then how is that
different from randomly moving { } symbols to other parts of your
program? I think your problem with Haskell stems for simple lack
of experience in programming in that language.

I would be very interested if you could point to any instance in
the SPAD coding in the Axiom library of a logic error due to
incorrect indentation. I am not saying that it is not possible,
but simply that I find it unlikely.

Regards,
Bill Page.

When discussing _language syntax_, what else can you expect except
personal experience?  Call it anectotal if you like, but syntax is a
primary tool to express ideas.  It should not get in the way.

That is a meaningless request.  Ask Tim what he thinks about the pile

I'm just glad Adlor provided a better alternative.

If Bill can attract more people to help with Axiom, I wouldn't care 
whether they come because of #pile or other reasons.

More important than #pile or not is that we get more developers.
Let Aldor/Axiom develop and see what people like most.

Perhaps some day there appears a "beautifier" program that translates 
between pile and non-pile, so you/we could read the code in the way 
you/we like.

Don't waste time arguing about "blanks".

I believe there is a **lot** more to syntax than just personal
experience. (Of course you know that...) There are some very
good formal tools for describing the syntax natural languages
which carry over well to programming languages. The basic point
is to be able to deduce structure from some serialization, i.e.
from a 1-dimensional linear representation of that structure. But
these formal languages tools do have some limitations. Although
serialization certainly has wide application, humans and computers
are not limited to communicating in this manner. How often have
you heard: "A picture is worth a thousand words."?

Mathematicians have understand the importance of this concept
for some time. This is certainly clear in graph theory and I
would claim that it is evident in the wide spread use of commutative
diagrams in category theory.

The point of using indentation to representation program structure
actually has less to do with syntax and more to do with the
expressiveness of the language. You are probably not arguing that
indentation has no purpose in programming languages but rather that
it should be limited to illustrating program structure for human
readability and not for compiler construction. But I would argue
the other way. I think we need to do more to aid the communication
between human and computer and that encoding program structure by
indentation is only one small step in that direction. There are,
for example some rather well developed programming languages which
make use of a graphical input to define programs - so called
"visual programming".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language

BTW, There are some statistics (probably not very reliable) which
suggest that Python is one of the most "expressive" widely used
programming languages ever invented:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages#Expressi=
ven
ess

I think it would be very interesting to consider the Axiom library
from the point of view of these "statement ratio" measures. It seems
to me that SPAD would probably rate even higher on this scale.

I did not call syntax anecdotal. To say it another way: I think your
personal experience with using indentation in Haskell is not a
reliable guide on which to base judgements about syntax.

Why is it meaningless? I thought you were arguing that #pile notation
might lead to a larger number of logic errors than in those programs
that use the {]; decorations.

As far as I know, Aldor processes both #pile and non-pile inputs in
the same way. The use of #pile mode just increases the expressiveness
of the language a little.

I think Ralf called it - the way to do this is have some kind of
pretty-printer that can convert between the two.  They are, after all,
at some level functionally the same.  The difference is just in how we
(the human programmers) are viewing the logic.

Eventually, we should have a button on editors that can switch code
between pile and no-pile with one push.  Then everybody's happy.

I suppose that's a project in itself though.

Note that a (rudimentary) converter from pile to nopile is included in the
axiom compiler. just say

Note that it makes many mistakes, but that's probably fixable.

Alfredo

On August 18, 2006 4:59 PM you asked:

> Probably this has come out many times in previous discussions.
> Given the latex output from Axiom, what would be the best way

>

By "complete" do you mean the output of an entire Axiom session?
Using just dvipng would result in one png file for each page of
the latex document. Certainly it is possible to present the output
of LaTeX in this format but treating everything as an image has
severe limitations in a web browser.

To render a LaTeX document, I think you would be better off using
latex to HTML tool like TeX4ht

http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html

instead of just dvipng. TeX4ht will generate HTML with embedded
graphics or with MathML. Many people consider MathML the best
available format for web browsers. I agree that it probably will
be "real-soon-now".

> or how is it done on MathAction?

In MathAction (actually in ZWiki/LatexWiki) a wiki page is
composed of HTML with embedded png images only to represent the
mathematical formula. In the current version of MathAction the
png files are generated by ghostscript but Bob McElrath did have
an experimental version of LatexWiki that used dvipng. As I
recall there were some subtle issues regarding defining the image
baseline for proper inline placement of LaTeX-generated symbols.

This is very much like what TeX4ht does except that the source
format of the page is not LaTeX but rather StructuredText and/or
HTML with embedded LaTeX and Axiom commands.

As I mentioned earlier, an alternative to embedded graphics and
MathML is jsMath which uses Javascript to emulate the LaTeX math
typesetting functions directly on the web browser. Because this
is a complex process that runs in Javascript, it is quite a bit
slower than rendering HTML with embedded graphics. The AxiomUI
project made use of jsMath.

As you know, pamphlet files on MathAction are treated a little
differently with only a "thumbnail" displayed on the web page
containing links to the pdf and dvi format generated by LaTeX.
Originally we had planned to use TeX4ht to produce a web page
(or set of web pages) from the pamphlet source but there turned
out to be some technical limitations. It is quite possible with
some additional effort these problems could be solved. If you are
interested about this possibility, please ask.

Regards,
Bill Page.

The main problem here I think is that you seem to be trying to do
this using a simple cgi script in Apache?

Normally the Apache web server processes cgi requests in a stateless
manner, i.e. it starts a process, collects output and stops the
process on each request and doesn't remember anything from one call
to the next. To do something more sophisticated you will have to use
a different technique on the server side that permits a processes to
persist. See for example:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_perl
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_python

Another possibility is instead of using Apache, you could use a web
application server such as Zope or even PHP. Zope for example would
allow you to write methods in Python that communicate with an external
process and return results via xmlhttp.

> Is there a way to do this in python??? or any other language?

Yes, certainly. Besides established a web application server
environment the 2nd problem you have to solve is the communication
between Mod_perl/Mod_python/Zope and Axiom. To do this, I think your
best option here is to use a package such as pexpect

http://pexpect.sourceforge.net

(in python). There is something similar for perl

http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl
http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=3D9977&group_id=3D689=
4#descr
iption

but I haven't used it.

Pexpect starts some external process and uses the pseudo terminal (pty)
interface to send and receive commands and output to and from it.

For example Sage uses a version of pexpect to communicate with Maxima.

In the near future I intend to convert MathAction to using pexpect
instead of pipes (similar to what you describe above) because there
are problems with pipes as soon as you try to call processes that
communicate with other processes such as the way in which 'sman'
starts 'AXIOMsys' and a separate Axiom graphics process. The pty
interface solves this sort of problem because it interacts with
the processes at the level of the virtual serial pty device.

Regards,
Bill Page.

because it is about use of Axiom.  I'm wearing my Axiom user hat here.

still, we have an Axiom library written in something...

I'll appreciate an explanation of whether it is supposed to have any
at all.

Please note that Ralf's ALLPROSE does this already, also using tex4ht. In fact,
I think it's high time to switch to ALLPROSE. As far as I know, the only bit
missing is to make it talk to axiom instead of aldor, but that shouldn't be too
difficult, Ralf?

I am sorry Martin, but I don't understand. ALLPROSE does what
already? The problem referred to above is related to generating
HTML from Axiom pamphlet source that can be used on the Axiom
Wiki. Does Ralf have a version of ALLPROSE that can do that?
If so, could you add some example pages to wiki?

:) I have read the ALLPROSE documentation but it is not at
all clear to me how this could be done. Perhaps you can
elaborate on this idea? I think that in a open source project
saying "that it shouldn't be too difficult" can only be
interpreted as a "taunt" (i.e. trying to force someone to do
something) or a promise to actually do something yourself. :)

Regards,
Bill Page.

   I have installed tex4ht. For a single image to display, which is my
   current test case, dvipng is much faster. However, probably for a
   complete latex document to later be rendered as html probably
   TeX4ht should be better (maybe for the pamphlets).

    I see two projects listed in:
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SummerOfCode
    to get Axiom to output jsMath and MathML. Are these still needed?

As you know, pamphlet files on MathAction are treated a little

    The first time I used the pamphlet inside MathAction I was expecting to
have
    the whole pamphlet rendered as html. But displaying the "thumbnail" is
okay
    because you have the options to see the dvi or pdf.

    What I think is missing is have things like commands and graphics be
displayed
    also when save pamphlet. One way by using the method you already have
in:

    http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSagePamphlet

    or displaying in html pages. Whatever option you consider is more
convenient. I
    would be glad to work on achieving this.

    Regards,

    Jose Alfredo Perez

ALLPROSE produces HTML from a format very similar to pamphlet.

Sorry, I didn't mean to force anybody. What I did intend was encouragement. In
fact, that's why I wrote ", Ralf?" instead of "!". I don't really know how
difficult it is. Thus, I tried. 

Result: Generating documentation doesn't seem to be very difficult at all. The
main obstacle is, that ALLPROSE expects a semicolon to end a definition. Thus,
I cheated and wrote:


<<exports: testSPAD>>=
      double: R -> R --;
@

It seems that ALLPROSE also expects that the signature appears on one line,
Ralf? At least

<<exports: testSPAD>>=
      double: R -> _
                   R --;
@

did not work.

The main principle obstacle however is pile syntax (sorry Bill). It does not
mix well with neither .pamphlet_s nor .nw_s:

Continuing with

<<exports: testSPAD>>=
       triple: R -> R --;
@

Will produce an error, of course. But I guess, we have to live with that
problem anyway.

For compiling, we would have to change the extension .as to .spad and change
calls to aldor to axiom. This is beyond my knowledge of allprose though.

Martin

Camm,

I've been trying to build Axiom with the latest gcl-2.6.8pre checkout.

It fails when trying to compile the file in

Dear Igor,

great that you found the reason. Do you think you'd have the time to document
properly just the function powern? What you found is not the first bug in these
10 lines of code :-(

If you do have time, you should also look at the corresponding code for SUPXS
(very likely in ISUPS which is in sups.spad.pamphlet), since the bug does not
occur in that domain. (By the way, neither did the other one I fixed ages ago).

The operation is called cRationalPower(uts,r) there.

If you don't, please say so.

Thanks again,

Martin

Currently, I don't think that you need ALLPROSE to get the pamphlet 
files shown as html. Tex4ht should be quite enough.
The problem I see is that every pamphlet file is a separate thing. No 
links between different files. But let's not bother with that now. As I 
understood, someone wants an html button for the pamphlet files that 
triggers a routine to produce HTML from the .pamphlet.

First of all, we still haven't agreed on a general structure of pamphlet 
files. All I have seen is that most (if not all) contain the lines

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{axiom}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}

If for the purpose of translating that file to html you provide an 
appropriate axiom.sty (and axiom.4ht) which can be different from the 
current existing axiom.sty, then I believe that should be doable.

Let's press the html button.

Then noweave is called to produce .tex.
Then htlatex is called to produce .html. (you might want to call 
makeindex/bibtex... in the middle)

I don't see the problem except that tex4ht sometimes needs a little help 
if strange commands appear in the LaTeX text.

Or maybe that is not the goal, then please clarify what should be 
achieve and what is the input.

Ralf

Here is a

  svn -diff

of my working copy with the accummulated patches

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/camm-patches-2.6.8pre.txt

Will this work for you?

You will also need to pull a new version of gcl-2.6.8pre from the
cvs, thus:

>   export CVSROOT=3D:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl
>   cvs -z9 -q co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl

Let me know if this is enough.

Thanks.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Or perhaps as a replacement for the "thumbnail" image of the first
page which is currently rendered as a png? Or maybe it better to
keep this thumbnail since in some cases the document can be very
large, e.g. the entire Axiom Book.

For example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/Bookvol1

I'll agree to an 'html' button on the header line. :)

Yes.

Sorry, I've forgotten most of what I once knew about tex4ht. :)
Of course we want only one source file from which to generate all
of the dvi, ps, pdf and html. I presume that the required changes
to 'axiom.sty' can be made compatible with all these formats?

What is axiom.4ht? Can it be present in the source .tex even
if I just run latex to get the standard dvi, ps, and pdf?

>=20

You mean metaphorically speaking ... :)

I the case of the Axiom Wiki this action actually takes place
during the 'Save' button processing. The 'html' link on the
header line would be just that - a link to the html file
previously generated by htlatex.

When generating .html with embedded images for the formula
where do the image files go? Subdirectory? Since there will
be multiple pamphlet files on the wiki, we must take care
where to put the bits and pieces.

>=20

Yes, as I recall this is were we ran into some trouble. The Axiom
pamphlet files contain a lot of tex neologisms which are acceptable
to latex but the author of tex4ht, Eitan Gurari, considers need
not be accepted by tex4ht.

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-10/msg00233.ht
ml

So it seems that to get reliable HTML this way, we may need to
upgrade the standard of LaTeX used in the Axiom pamphlet files.

Eitan Gurari was also working on a jsMath version of tex4ht. I am
not sure of the status of that version.

>=20

Yes, I think that is the goal.

I am willing to give this a try. But I am probably going to need
some help. :)

When latex is called during 'Save' we save the log file and make
it accessible by the 'log' link on the header line so that the
use can check it for errors. Perhaps we also need a separate link
for the log produced by 'htlatex' since these apparently will some
times be different.

Regards,
Bill Page.

>=20

To deal with pile syntax maybe we could make use of the
SPAD to Aldor translation option built into Axiom that
you mentioned in another thread? Even if it is not perfect,
perhaps it is good enough to enable ALLPROSE to more easily
extract the necessary information?

>From my point of view the objectives of using ALLPROSE are a
little different than the objectives satisfied by the Axiom
pamphlet files. As I understand it, one of the main points
is to be able to extract the comments embedded in the Aldor/SPAD
source code and typeset it along with other parts of the
documentation that are just LaTeX segments of the pamphlet
file. And also to create appropriate hyperlinks to this stuff.
Is that right? In that case, in the end will it be at least
a partial replacement for the hyperdoc browser?

I think we need to talk more about how this would work both
in a stand alone desktop environment and on the Axiom Wiki.

Bill Page.

No problem. Or more to the point: I understand the problem. ;)

I have built a version of Axiom using the most recent gcl-2.6.8pre
from your CVS and Axiom source from the build-improvements branch
of Axiom Silver with the following gcl configure options:

GCLOPTS=3D"--enable-debug --disable-xgcl --enable-vssize=3D65536*2
 --enable-statsysbfd --enable-maxpage=3D196*1024"

Note: This is the same version (except for --enable-debug) that
I used to test your recent patches for the new gcl-2.6.8pre.

You should be able access it on axiom-developer.org by setting:

  $ export AXIOM=3D/home/page/axiom.build-improvements/mnt/linux
  $ export PATH=3D$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

Darn! Another bug??

Ok, forget that for now. '/var/zope/var/LatexWiki' is where the
directory XPRIMARR.NRLIB lives. When compiling SPAD source code
Axiom wants to replace the existing XPRIMARR.NRLIB with another
directory called XPRIMARR.erlib. The problem seems to be that
the gcl function that Axiom uses to do this will not even allow
the directory XPRIMARR.NRLIB to be over written or deleted
even though similar gcl functions can delete the individual
files in that directory.  Try it this way:

----------------

  $ cd /var/zope/var/LatexWiki

The \usepackage{axiom} instruction requests a general purpose style
file axiom.sty.  When a compilation is done under tex4ht, a search is
automatically triggered for an extra axiom.4ht file.  An axiom.4ht
file is expected to introduce html configurations for the features
defined in axiom.sty.

A jsmath configuration for tex4ht went public on 21 Dec 2005 (see
http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes.html).

Hi,

First of all, I want to point out that I don't want to advocate against
ALLPROSE for documentation, which is in fact an interesting development
framework.
Nevertheless, my contribution do the documentation discussion is
non-ALLPROSE. Did you consider using an "javadoc" style for
documentation. E.g. doxygen is a mature and flexible tool aimed primary
at C++ but extended to some more languages. The output formats include
html, latex, and rtf. Furthermore, doxygen can be "easily" extended by
using a preprocessor. I used a simple (and short) perl script to
generate a doxygen documentation for a bunch of VHDL source files (VHDL
is a language for hardware description of digital circuits) by mapping
part of the VHDL syntax to C++. In terms of documentation, the Axiom
Types correspond to C++ objects. Furthermore, both languages have public
exports and private functions, ...

In my opinion, this is _not_ an out-of-the-box solution, yet worth
considering.

Regards,

Gernot

Bill,

I added a pointer to instructions at the end of the first paragraph in

   http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/bugfixes.html

Hopefully they are not buggy.

yes, i wrote a document on the internal details of the Jikes compiler
using doxygen and i have used javadoc extensively on many projects.
both are excellent tools for documentation. but we're not trying to 
write documentation.

the choice of noweb-style programming is more a matter of philosophy
than technical details. the hardest and most subtle part of the choice
is a change of mindset. it really can be distinguished by the difference
between the words "document" and "literature". "documents" are what 
programmers write to help other programmers. "literature" is what you
write when you want to communicate with another person above the level
of implementation.

after a few false starts i eventually settled on knuth's style.
most scientists know latex and use it to write technical papers.
noweb only adds a trivial amount of syntax to latex and is an
easy learning curve. so for computational science, latex is a natural
choice.

and latex is widely used to write books (aka literature) so for 
writing mathematics "literature" it is also a natural.

the hardest part is that it really is a cliff-like transition to 
do literate programming. it is NOT the same as hacking the source
and adding some words around it. more like writing the ideas and
then reducing them to practice. it took me a couple years to 
finally realize the subtle but vital difference. it is the same
insight a programmer gets when he first learns lisp, mistakenly
thinking that lisp is "just another language". at some point there
is a "religious conversion" when, having seen the light, you can
only mourn the wasted years of non-enlightenment :-)

literate programming is not the same as documentation.

Thank you! I feel a little more human now. :) and I've now got
jsMath from the command:

  htlatex test2 "xhtml,jsmath" " -cmozhtf"

See: http://page.axiom-developer.org/test2.html

I think your instructions are fine but I have just a few
comments and questions:

1) [Configuration files]

   On my system teTeX is apparently looking in a different
   (non-standard?) place for texmf/tex/generic/tex4ht. From
   the output of htlatex I deduced that I had to use:

   cp texmf/tex/generic/tex4ht/* \
      /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-dist/tex/generic/tex4ht

   instead of /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/tex4ht, although
   it do also have this directory on my system.

   At first I completely followed your instructions exactly
   as you wrote them. Everything seemed to go fine, and passed
   the simple test each time but there was no jsMath output
   from

     htlatex test2 "xhtml,jsmath" " -cmozhtf"

   After I repeated just your step 2 using using the copy
   command shown above, now it works.

2. [Fonts]

   I also have a directory:

     /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-dist/tex4ht/ht-fonts

   in addition to /usr/share/texmf/tex4ht/ht-fonts but I did only
   the copy
     =20
     cp -rp ht-fonts /usr/share/texmf/tex4ht

3. paths

   In step 20 I did a global replace of '~/tex4ht.dir/texmf/tex4ht'
   with '/usr/share/texmf/tex4ht' in the file

     /usr/share/texmf/tex4ht/base/unix/tex4ht.env

   Is this sufficient to make sure that tex4ht also finds the new
   fonts? Or should I also put them in texmf-dist?

     cp -rp ht-fonts /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-dist/tex4ht

4. The html file that is generated from jsmath option contains
   the following location for the jsMath:

    <script type=3D"text/javascript" src=3D"jsMath/jsMath/jsMath.js">
    </script>

  with jsMath/ repeated twice in the path. This seems (perhaps)
  a non-standard location for jsMath.js. On the axiom-developer
  server it needs only one instance of jsMath/. Is this
  configurable?

Many, many thanks for this work! :)

Regards,
Bill Page.

I agree with you, there are no alternatives to latex.

I'm afraid: no. In fact, I will very likely use it myself, but it won't go into
the distribution until it is documented.

But it is certainly enough to explain roughly what is happening in every couply
of lines in powern and to explain exactly what your patch is doing. Thus,
along the lines of

The following operation [[powerrn]] computes lazily ???

[[powern(rn, x)]] computes $x^{rn}$, $x$ being a power series. Compare with
[[cRationalPower$ISUPS]].

          n = 1000 =>
            error "**: series with many leading zero coefficients"
@

First we determine the order of [[x]], i.e., the index of the first non-zero
coefficient. (Is that true ???)

Remarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that usually [[leave]] takes no arguments. I don't know what it does
      here.
\item [[empty? x]] tests whether the stream [[x]] has no elements. This is
      mathematically the same as the corresponding power series being zero.

[[ord]] will be the order of the new power series. If it is not an integer, we
won't get a Taylor expansion.

Not really. The documentation says

  A  :   Type
  ST ==> Stream

    Y: (ST A -> ST A) -> ST A
      ++ Y(f) computes a fixed point of the function f.

In our case A is the ring of coefficients and powern calls

Y(powerrn(rn,x,#1))

Here, rn is the exponent, and x is the power series. Thus, Y computes a fixed
point - whatever that is - of the function

f +-> powerrn(rn, x, f)

I guess it would help to know what powerrn does. A different possibility to
find out is to look at cRationalPower in sups.spad.pamphlet. The block
(formally) corresponding to 

        power := 
          one? co => YS(powerrn(rn, x, #1))
          one? (denom rn) =>
            not negative?(num := numer rn) => 
-- It seems that this cannot happen, but I don't know why
              (co ** num::NNI) * YS(powerrn(rn, (invCo::A) * x, #1))
            (invCo::A)**((-num)::NNI) * YS(powerrn(rn, (invCo::A) * x, #1))

          RATPOWERS => co ** rn * YS(powerrn(rn, (invCo::A) * x, #1))
          error "** rational power of coefficient undefined"

        zeropref: ST A := new(ord::I::NNI, 0$A)$LA :: ST A
        concat(zeropref, power)


reads (ccInv == invCo, n == ord, cc == co, r == rn, uts == x)

        ccPow :=
          one? cc => cc
          one? denom r =>
            not negative?(num := numer r) => cc ** (num::NNI)
            (ccInv::Coef) ** ((-num)::NNI)

          RATPOWERS => cc ** r
          error "** rational power of coefficient undefined"

        uts1 := (ccInv::Coef) * uts
        uts2 := uts1 * monomial(1, -order)
        monomial(ccPow, (n::I) * numer(r)) * cPower(uts2, r::Coef)



So, it seems that in ISUPS, the equivalent to YS(powerrn(rn, (invCo::A) * x,
#1)) is factored out. We have the equivalence

ccPow  * z^(n*numer r) * cPower(ccInv * uts * z^(-order), r)

power  * z^ord         * YS(powerrn(rn, (invCo::A) * x, #1)) 

Note that n*numer r = order/denom r * numer r = order * r

     but  ord       = order/denom rn          = order * rn / numer rn

so that "explains" the appearance of z^(-order) in the ISUPS version.


I have to stop here, sorry,

Martin

If you latex the .pamplet.tex file then (of course) latex does not know 
about axiom.4ht and ignores it completely. So nothing will change.

Now, htlatex... that does invoke latex, too, but before the 
\documentclass of the file is touched, several tweaks specific to tex4ht 
are done. One of that is that whenever you have a \usepackage{blah} it 
reads the file blah.sty and later also blah.4ht if that is there. (I 
hope, I remember that correctly.)

Normally tex4ht is clever enough so that you simply don't need the .4ht 
file. In ALLPROSE, however, I have these colored environments done with 
the "framed" package which did not work with tex4ht. Fortunately, it was 
quite easy to find an equivalent for the html output. That I have 
written into allprose.4ht. See Chapter 26 or the ALLPROSE documentation.

Anyway, forget about the, .4ht until something does not htlatex. Then 
post to the list and to Eitan Guari. He tries to be quite responsive in 
such matters. I really don't know why the LaTeX people haven't included 
tex4ht in normal TeX distributions. Tex4ht is really quite powerful 
because it uses the tex machine.

Oh, if that is done this way, no problem. Of course it is better to 
cache the html output.

Ehm.... the html target in ALLPROSE looks like

html: tex4htlatex tex4htpostproces docdir
	$(CP) $(projectname)*.html $(DOCDIR)
	$(CP) $(projectname)*.css  $(DOCDIR)
	-$(CP) $(projectname)*.png  $(DOCDIR)
	@echo
	@echo "$(HTMLVIEWER) $(DOCDIR)/$(projectname).html &"
	@echo

So everything is output in the directory where you process the file 
$(projectname).tex. Then I simply copy them to the place I want them to be.

By the way, if you look at the toplevel Makefile, you'll realize that I 
don't call htlatex. The version of tex4ht that I get with debian sarge 
did not meet my needs. Meanwhile I had conversations with Eitan and some 
other guy who improved htlatex and friends quite a lot. I don't know, 
however, whether this is already released.

Well, maybe we should start with dhmatrix. I somehow agree with you and 
Eitan. Writing TeX should not be considered the best way of writing a 
.pamphlet file. LaTeX is so much more structured that it is easier to 
convert to other formats. One cannot do all the TeX tricks and outputs 
equivalent HTML. Page numbers is one thing that you don't need in html.

Anyway, would it be a good start to take dhmatrix. We could tex->latex 
it while we try to get an html out of it.

And... perhaps we should first forget about mathml. I think the .png 
generation is the easier way to go.

> I am willing to give this a try. But I am probably going to need
> some help. :)

Well, do we have an svn branch for that? I just want to say "svn update" 
and "htlatex dhmatix" (or better make dhmatrix.html). Once we have some 
experience with compiling dhmatrix, we could cary on for the other 
files. Then you could try to write a python wrapper to get it into 
mathaction.

Let us also forget for a moment about the \begin{axiom} ... \end{axiom} 
environments. Just translating them as verbatim would be fine.

Later, I think, one needs a script that runs over the .pamphlet.tex 
file, extracts the content of the environment, writes it out to a 
file/several files axiom.somenumber.input, and at the same time modifies 
the environment \begin{axiom} ... \end{axiom} to 
\begin{axiomoutput}{somenumber} ... \end{axiomoutput} and writes a file 
.pamphlet.ax.tex.
Then run axiom and produce files axiom.somenumber.tex (maybe a script is 
involve here to split the axiom output into its parts -- but that you 
know already from mathaction, I guess).
After that call htlatex on the generated .pamphlet.ax.tex file. The 
\begin{axiomoutput}{somenumber} ... \end{axiomoutput} environments 
should simply ignore there content and set the content of the file 
axiom.somenumber.tex.

Doesn't sound un-doable to me.

Ralf

The one thing I don't understand about all this is:

why won't we use ALLPROSE?

I meant, neither with pamphlet (i.e., Axiom project) files, nor with noweb
(i.e., ALLPROSE) files.

No. First of all, I don't think it's necessary. You only have to teach ALLPROSE
how to find out where a line ends. Currently, in ALLPROSE, the regexp used is
described in Section tools/addaldortypedef.pl of the ALLPROSE documentation,
but Ralf certainly knows better than me.

That's one thing I cannot do.

Well, the pamphlets satisfy only a subset of our needs. In particular, there is
very little support for HyperDoc. Using ALLPROSE, you get that (nearly) for
free: the +++ environments are copied into the code. When compiling the file
with Axiom, they magically appear in HyperDoc. Of course, within the +++
environments, one would have to restrict oneself to those things hyperdoc
understands. For example, ALLPROSE produces

+++   \begin{addescription}{Generates all isomorphism types.}
+++   \end{addescription}
+++   \begin{ToDo}
+++     \begin{rhx} 14-Aug-2006:
+++       It is not yet clear what the type of this function/constant
+++       should be.
+++ %
+++       In general, isomorphism types are equivalence classes of
+++       structures. It could be reasonable to say that \adthisname{}
+++       returns (unique) representatives of these classes. (The
+++       \emph{unique} is probably a though thing, since we might have no

+++     \end{rhx}
+++   \end{ToDo}
--#line 384 "species.as.nw"
isomorphismTypes: Set L -> Generator %;


Now, the main problem are the commands \adthisname and \adthistype. In the dvi
(or html or whatever) generated by ALLPROSE, they are replaced by the
appropriate names. In the example above, one would read:

+++       structures. It could be reasonable to say that isomorphismTypes
+++       returns (unique) representatives of these classes. (The

HyperDoc cannot handle that, unfortunately.

Ralf, would it be very difficult to make ALLPROSE magically replace \adthisname
with \spadfun{isomorphismTypes} (or, if you like that better, with
\adthisname{isomorphismTypes}) and \adthistype with
\spadType{CombinatorialSpecies}?

That's the second thing I cannot do.

All the other things I can do within HyperDoc.

Thanks for the explanations about .4ht etc.

I read somewhere in the tex4ht that the path prefix of the
images directory is configurable. I suppose this is not normally
to significant, but I just did a few experiments using htlatex on

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/book--main--1/bookvol1.tex

As a pdf file this is about 800 pages.  As html it generates nearly
600 png files and my browsers (both FireFox and Explorer) die while
trying to render it. And the download is pretty horrendous anyway
:( htlatex indicates a large number of errors which I simply skipped
for this test.

So it seems that ""one big file" here is not really such a good idea.

Running mzhtml on this file to generate MathML unfortunately results
in an improperly formatted XML file:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/book--main--1/bookvol1m.xml

The xml file is about 3 times the size of the pdf file.

Interestingly, running the command

  htlatex bookvol1 "xhtml,jsmath" " -cmozhtf"

to produce a jsMath HTML file results in a file that is slightly
smaller than the pdf file:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/book--main--1/bookvol1.html

Unfortunately the jsMath rendering takes quite a long time - about
2 minutes on my 1 GHz system. It's only about a minute if I set
the option to delay display until after the jsMath processing.
But it does do a pretty nice job ... To bad there doesn't seem
to be any way to get more speed out of JavaScript.

Agreed.

Good idea except it looks like this one works already! This document
was one of the test files that I originally recommended to Eitan so
perhaps he did tweak tex4ht a little more to help make this work.
(If so, thanks Eitan. :)

The tex file is available here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/DhmatrixSpad

>=20

htlatex generates

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/dhmatr
ix2.spad.html

and about 70 png files with no errors.

Running

  htlatex dhmatrix.spad "xhtml,jsmath" " -cmozhtf"

produced the following jsMath document (also with no errors):

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/dhmatr
ix.spad.html

It takes about 30 seconds to render but I think it looks great.

Finally mzlatex gives:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/dhmatr
ix3.spad.xml

unfortunately with another xml error message:

You should be able to do that now. Take a look for

  src/algebra/dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet

and just noweave the dhmatrix.spad.tex file.

Sage has a very nice little latex package for doing exactly
this sort of thing (but more simply). I think we can easily
adapt it for Axiom. If you have the Sage distribution, it is
in the 'examples/latex-embed' directory. If you don't want
do download and install all of Sage, then I can just send it
to you. Also the new graphviz.sty has a similar technique that
could even be used to run Axiom automatically as part of the
LaTeX compile.

>=20

Quite doable. Now, the question is: Are Axiom developers and
users really motivated to use this sort of thing??

Bill Page.

Of course. You certainly know about the +++ comments. These things have 
been invented before Java came into existence. The only problem with 
Aldor is that there is not yet a proper tool to make use of this data.

ALLPROSE hast \begin{+++} ... \end{+++} for that.

 > E.g. doxygen is a mature and flexible tool aimed primary
> at C++ but extended to some more languages.

Yep, doxygen is too much tailored for C/C++. If you make it work for 
Aldor, it might be worth another try.

But as Tim suggests, that is not the point of literate programming. LP 
is here to express your ideas and illustrate these ideas by real (in 
contrast to pseudo) code. So you basically write a research article (or 
so). In that sense I fully support Tim and Knuth.

But as you can see with my \begin{+++} ... \end{+++} environments, I 
also strongly believe that for using other peoples work it is often 
quite sufficient if you know about the API of what that library/program 
does on which you want to build. You do not usually want to read 
thousands of pages and books before you are able to write one single 
line of code.

I, for example, would be quite happy if someone writes a library for 
factorization of multivariate polynomials in an LP style and 
additionally gives me a short API description of what his function does 
and how I have to call it. I am simply not interested in learning all 
the difficult stuff about an efficient implementation and about tricks 
in this implementation to make it even more efficient. I want to use 
factorization. If I ever become interested in the details, I can come 
back to that later.

So my approach in ALLPROSE is to write in an LP style and *additionally* 
provide an API description for those who don't want to delve too deeply 
into the details.

If you can make some tool available that supports such a combined 
approach, I would be quite happy to see them.

But I would never sacrifice the LP approach to doxygen. Doxygen (to my 
taste--correct me if I'm wrong) is only about the API, ie half of the 
story -- if not less.

Ralf

All the current pamphlet stuff is legacy code. It simply doesn't fit so 
easily into ALLPROSE, yet making it available in an HTML form should be 
simple enough before we go the ALLPROSE way.

And as Bill pointed out, ALLPROSE is an environment for writing 
libraries. As I understood, making pamphlets available as HTML has 
nothing to do with libraries. At least not at the moment.

I guess, that is simply a plural s.

All that parsing of the source .as.nw files in ALLPROSE, is probably 
unnecessary for the generation of HTML from pamphlets. In ALLPROSE, I 
have added some conventions to make this parsing easier. These 
conventions are not there for pamphlet files so the parsing would mean 
to write a SPAD parser that understands noweb chunks. Ufff.

I simply have the suspicion that Martin talks about pamphlet files of 
the form .spad.pamphlet and anybody else means pamphlets with general 
content so also .lisp.pamphlet or Makefile.pamphlet. Am I wrong?

Oh, yes you are right. I had only SPAD in mind. On the other hand, you do
document your perl and Makefile stuff with ALLPROSE too, so, I guess that we
can focus on the differences between Aldor and SPAD.

OK. Although I think it would be high time to move from pamphlet files to
ALLPROSE files. After all, nothing forces us to use all the features of
ALLPROSE right away. The only thing we *have* to do is to transform the ++ and
+++ bits into +++ environments, because otherwise hyperdoc won't work anymore.

What? In what way is DHMATRIX different from a library?

No no, the conventions are quite OK. No way we are going to write yet another
SPAD parser. As far as I understand, since ALLPROSE literally copies the +++
environment into a +++ section, there is no need to adhere to the ALLPROSE
conventions at first. This becomes necessary only from the point from which we
want to use \adthisname and \adthistype. So I guess that the transformation of
spad.pamphlet into ALLPROSE files could be done in a semi-automatic way.

Am I missing something? I guess I'll have to try it out with some file.

I wouldn't care too much. tex4ht can split pages at section points (or 
in fact anywhere you like). Unfortunately, for some strange reason I do 
not get it to work with ALLPROSE. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough. And 
it was not so urgent to me.

Wow, that looks amazingly good. Hmm... but I think I would want colored 
backgrounds for the axiom-input and axiom-output lines.

But forget about it. If you look at bookvol1.pamphlet you see something like

\spadcommand{digits(49)}
and then we execute the command:

\spadcommand{solve(x**49-49*x**4+9 = 0,1.e-49)}
$$
\begin{array}{@{}l}
\displaystyle
\left[{x = -{0.6546536706904271136718122105095984761851224331
556}},  \right.
\\
\\
\displaystyle

\end{array}
$$

instead of
\begin{axiominput}
solve(x**49-49*x**4+9 = 0,1.e-49)
\end{axiominput}
\begin{axiomoutput}
... repeat the thing above (which should be autogenerated anyway)
\end{axiomoutput}

I have no way to simply modify a .sty or .4ht file to make that coloring 
happen. That is the problem with writing plain TeX. No good markup. :-(

I remember I have seen that thing in graphviz.sty. Nevertheless, could

I agree with you, most important is the API _together_ with a
description and examples, not the actual implementation. From my
experience far too often even the API is badly documented. In this case
a half of the story solution is much better than none at all.

Yes, you are right, I am/was too much focused on the API.

Thanks for your comments.

Aha. Maybe you were misled.
Maybe it is not so clear, what ALLPROSE actually is. The goal is to 
support the writing of Aldor libraries. But ALLPROSE itself is a program 
(or a collection of programs if you look deeper into it) and so it 
should also be documented properly using a LP style. That is what you 
see if you say

make include-allprose-documentation
make dvi

without the first make you only get the documentation of the library, 
and I guess most people are just happy with it, but the documentation of
ALLPROSE itself always sleeps somewhere in the background and can be 
awakened.

In some sense you are right that I would like such a system for all of 
Axiom. But for now I cannot do this since I simply do not yet understand 
the Axiom build process. You can see ALLPROSE as a small example of 
where I want to see the Axiom sources in the future. You type "make dvi" 
at the top-level and get a (probably HUGE) document that describes all 
the sources, the buildprocess and the library code (and yes, it 
describes also how "make dvi" works). But that is a big task and it has 
to fight agains lots of legacy code. I cannot simply introduce some 
conventions because they might conflict with some part of Axiom deep 
deep into the jungle (which, of course is currently undocumented). So 
first comes the documentation (or an experimentation in some 
svn-branch). But it's a super long way to go.

Oh yes, good suggestion. But again, you speak just of the .spad.pamphlet 
files.

Anyway, you are right that all new code should follow the few simple 
guidelines that Christian and I have worked out. You can find it in 
ALLPROSE in the description of aldordoc.sty.

Maybe, I am wrong, but for me DHMATRIX is just a domain. A library is 
something like libaldor, libalgebra, libaxiom.

OK. If you want. \begin{+++} ... \end{+++} should be written just in 
front of the chunk you want to document. If ALLPROSE finds a

define CategoryName(...): Category ==

or

DomainName(...): ...

in that chunk, then that corresponds to \atthistype. (And, yes Martin, 
that can be replaced on the fly by the appropriate \adtype{DomainName}, 
but that is only half of the story.)

Other types of chunks look like

foo: Type1 -> Type2;

So they should look like function of constant declarations in a with 
part. The +++ environment then is associated to the name foo.

That is not too hard. The problem only is that such a "foo" line has to 
be one line. It is an important restriction, because the whole line is 
translated into a command

\addefinename{foo: Type1 -> Type2}{...}{...}{...}

and later used to distinugish a link to that function from a link to a 
function

foo: % -> Type2

Even note that ALLPROSE allows to have two domains A and be defining the 
same function foo. One can writing \adname{foo} is ambiguous, but 
\adname[A]{foo} or even better \adname[B]{foo:%->Type2} would be more 
appropriate. Don't worry about the %. A script takes care before latex 
has a chance to see it.

I don't think there is much (formal) difference between a domain and a library.

I have no probelm with that. In fact, Axiom also needs it on one line. If a
definition is longer than that, you have to use _

Thus, If you want to do a super trooper thing, change the regexp in a way that
instead looking for a semicolon, it just goes on until it finds a newline
without a preceding underscore.

If one domain for you makes a library, so be it. But for me a library 
covers a certain small area. And that usually involves several domains. 
Look at our species stuff. You already see several domains in just one 
file. You would not tell me that putting each of them into a separate 
library makes much sense.

>> [...]  in that chunk, then that corresponds to \atthistype. (And, yes Martin,

> Why?

That is the reason why it is completely unnecessary to replace 
\adthistype by \adtype{DomainName}. If you look at the generated 
.as.nw.tex file, you see that after \begin{+++} there suddenly appears 
an \addefinetype{DomainName} that you have never typed yourself. This 
command defines \adthistype. So you should be already happy.

I don't know your scenario. First of all, would it be an option for you 
to translate your code into Aldor and use libaxiom. Then I see a better 
chance for your guessing package to use ALLPROSE.

Otherwise, could you exactly specify what you want?

I don't want a such a thing, I want a semicolon. ;-)

No, I'm not. I need this in the generated .spad (or .as) file, i.e., here

I'd like to have ALLPROSE instead of \adthisname{} write

I know, Ralf. Me too. And I'd like to have at least a promise from Stephen Watt
and Algebra.as and SumIt.as

Don't leave me in the dark. Specify exactly what you want to do/achieve 
otherwise I cannot follow.

Wrong. In ALLPROSE there are no places where you should write +++ or ++ 
inside code chunks. If you do it, ALLPROSE doesn't care, but such 
documentation is NEVER extracted by ALLPROSE. Instead you write the 
documentation into a \begin{+++} ...\end{+++} environment. And all that 
appears in the Latex part of the noweb file. Of course, inside that 
environment you use latex as usual, but you should not just write 
arbitrary latex, you should follow some style.

\begin{+++}
   \begin{adusage}
      -- write here aldor code to demonstrate hoe the function type
      -- is used in a common situation (kind of example code)
   \end{adusage}
   \begin{adparameters}
     % Describe here the input parameters by using
     % \adparameter{foo: A->B} instead of \item
   \end{adparameters}
   \begin{addescription}{Short docu goes here}
     Extensive documentation of the function/type
   \end{addescription}
   \begin{adexceptions}
     % Use \adthrows{SyntaxException} instead of \item to
     % describe all the exceptions this function throws.
   \end{adexceptions}
   \begin{adremarks}
     % Here you should mention exceptional stuff, maybe your function
     % works in a destructive way
   \end{adremarks}
   \begin{adseealso}
     % Give links to relates things.
   \end{adseealso}
\end{+++}

If you don't follow that convention/structure, it's also fine, but then 
it is the same as it is now. Every one invents his/her own style for the 
+++ comments and it is hard (if not impossible) to write good tools that 
handle all the various stiles.

 > And also to create appropriate hyperlinks to this stuff.
> Is that right? In that case, in the end will it be at least
> a partial replacement for the hyperdoc browser?

Right. That part of ALLPROSE aims at replacing hyperdoc. But as I said 
before, I would rather like to take a set of libraries, extract all the 
+++ comments and then produce a hyperlinked document (website or such) 
as an API description just from the libraries. No .as source code should 
be needed.

> I think we need to talk more about how this would work both
> in a stand alone desktop environment and on the Axiom Wiki.

The stand alone way, I just describe above. The Wiki way is maybe as 
simple as extracting the +++ environments and the corresponding code 
chunk and putting it together. But note, in order to get links from one 
piece of code to another you have to noweave all the files together (for 
getting links inside the codechunks) and latex them all together for 
latex taking care of the hyperlinks across different files. Maybe the 
latter could also done separately but sharing .aux files, but that is 
beyond my abilities.

I tried to compile the file for native dvi latex output and was
successful only after introducing the following disabling instructions.

     \let\spadfunFrom=\empty 
     \def\spadgraph#1{} 
     \let\nwfilename=\empty 
     \long\def\nwbegincode#1\nwendcode{} 
     \long\def\moddef#1\endmoddef{}

Not sure what is the reason, unless my axiom.sty is outdated.

 > :( htlatex indicates a large number of errors which I simply skipped

A compilation under htlatex shows a support problem for
\begin{list}...\end{list}. I'll need to look into this case.

Quite a few problems resulting from sources similar to

    $$ 
    [{ \mbox{\rm Hue: } {22} \mbox{\rm Weight: } {1.0}} \mbox{\rm ] from
    the }  
    Dark \mbox{\rm palette}  
    $$ 

in which the fences [ and ] improperly set to take the form [...\mbox{]}.

Three formulas similar to:

It should be easy for me to identify the reason for the problem given
a minimal miniature latex file demonstrating the problem.

Hmm, I don't understand why? The function name and its type appears at 
the bottom. So the information is there. I don't have any glue which 
(existing) tool you want to use in order to process the +++ stuff from 
the .spad or .as file. Be a bit more precise.

Would you be happy with the \addefinename{...} thing at the beginning. I 
don't know yet whether this is easily achievable, but I have the feeling 
that it would be easier.

But still, what use is it to have that stuff inside the spad file if you 
have no tool to process it, or have you?

Then you should write to Stephen for compiler and libraries and to

probably i am; but i can't figure out what 'this sort of thing' is.

I don't know exactly what example you want. First. TeX is a programming 
language and HTML is not. In latex you would write "as we have seen on 
page 67" in HTML that make no good sense. You would rather like to see a 
link to the place you are referring to.

You've probably seen the difference between TeX and LaTeX (well, I know 
LaTeX is TeX) in my recent mail.

So here I quote it again since I don't yet see it in the archive.

------
Hmm... but I think I would want colored backgrounds for the axiom-input 
and axiom-output lines.

But forget about it. If you look at bookvol1.pamphlet you see something like

\spadcommand{digits(49)}
and then we execute the command:

\spadcommand{solve(x**49-49*x**4+9 = 0,1.e-49)}
$$
\begin{array}{@{}l}
\displaystyle
\left[{x = -{0.6546536706904271136718122105095984761851224331
556}},  \right.
\\
\\
\displaystyle
\left.{x ={1.086921395653859508493939035954893289009213388763}},
   \right.
\\
\\
\displaystyle
\left.{x ={0.654653670725527173969468606613676483536148760766
1}}\right]
\end{array}
$$

instead of
\begin{axiominput}
solve(x**49-49*x**4+9 = 0,1.e-49)
\end{axiominput}
\begin{axiomoutput}
... repeat the thing above (which should be autogenerated anyway)
\end{axiomoutput}

I have no way to simply modify a .sty or .4ht file to make that coloring 
happen. That is the problem with writing plain TeX. No good markup.  :-(

Writing proper environments makes translation to other formats a lot easier.

That is a pity. It means that *somebody* has to edit 1,300
packages, domains and categories and manually extract all
that documentation. In order that it can become "proper"
documentation. :(

Wouldn't it be nice if ALLPROSE treated both occurrence
of ++ comments the same way?

Of course this same information is already extracted by the
SPAD compiler and stored in the Axiom database. This database
is what is consulted by Hyperdoc and the )sh command etc. I
wonder whether a system like ALLPROSE should also have such
a database component?

Agreed. I think you might find it very interesting to study
how this was handled in the Sage project. A very large
amount of program-level documentation is coded as a LaTeX
document in the docstring of each Python module. This text
is extracted and processed by LaTeX to create the 1000+ page
reference manual and also available for online help in the
interpreter.

It is not literate programming in the style of Knuth, but
is a **lot** better than what we have sprinkled throughout
Axiom's SPAD code. And this is a project that is only two
years old...

Again I wonder about the need for a database. The web pages
on the Axiom Wiki for example are stored in the Zope Database.
This allows pages to carry additional attributes such as the
list of "parents" that define the subtopic lattice, last editor,
dates, etc. This information is being searched dynamically to
create the left sidebar navigation for the wiki. A similar
thing could be code for navigating between pages containing
literate source code. But this does require a web site interface
and does not translate easily to a printed format.

In principle there is no reason why the Axiom Wiki could not
directly consult the Axiom database (daase files) the way
hyperdoc does now.

Sometimes I wonder just how appropriate LaTeX-oriented tools
are for this task...

I believe it would, but the problem is that I cannot easily make the 
documentation smaller, because it would basically mean that I find the 
problem myself.

I cannot blame you, since the reason why it doesn't work is probably on 
my side.

If it is small enough for you, then try to get ALLPROSE 
http://www.hemmecke.de/aldor/
and type

make html     or     make colored html

But maybe, before that you should modify Makefile.nw and replace

\g@addto@macro\@documentclasshook{\RequirePackage[html,frames]{tex4ht}}

by

\g@addto@macro\@documentclasshook{\RequirePackage[html,2,frames]{tex4ht}}

What I get is a the two frames (toc and text) where the text is just two 
pages. First page just contains the title with the abstract and the 
second contains everything.

If you find time to take a look at it. It would be very appreciated.

Once you have said

make html

you can investigate the .nw.tex files manually and apply htlatex or 
whatever you find appropriate.

If you don't understand the code, just ask.

HyperDoc processes exactly the lines preceded by +++ . So the line

  isomorphismTypes: Set L -> Generator %;

is out of reach for HyperDoc.

Yes, but unfortunately it wouldn't help me at all. In fact, I just discovered
that there is yet another problem: HyperDoc doesn't allow to define
environments. So I'd need some way to have \begin{addescription} replaced by
\beginaddescription and \end{addescription} by \endaddescription and so on.

Note that this kind of processing must only happen for the output to
csspecies.as.

Unfortunately, HyperDoc doesn't understand much of LaTeX...

HyperDoc understands \newcommand.

I did this many times, didn't even get an answer.

Yes, in the sense that the problem will be isolated and so its cause
easier to identify.  For pagination essentially one needs to find
where the sectioning commands of latex come from, and how those
commands are configured in tex4ht.

Indeed. A configuration similar to the following one, in the case of tex4ht.

   \ConfigureEnv{axiominput}
      {\HCode{<div class="axiominput">}}
      {\HCode{</div>}}
      {}{}
   \Css{div.axiominput {background-color:...;}}

Come on, if you like I'll write a 10 lines perl script that translates 
the +++ stuff into \begin{+++}..\end{+++} environments.

But there would be more to do. Take

+++ text
MyDomain: with {
     0: %;
        ++ that is a zero
     +++ This is a one.
     1: %;
     foo: () -> (); ++ and that is a foo.
} == add { ... }

In ALLPROSE that should have the format

\begin{+++}
   text
\end{+++}
<<dom: MyDomain>>=
MyDomain: with {
    <<exports: MyDomain>>
} == add {...}
@

\begin{+++}
   that is a zero
\end{+++}
%
<<exports: MyDomain>>=
0: %;
@


\begin{+++}
   This is a one.
\end{+++}
%
<<exports: MyDomain>>=
1: %;
@

\begin{+++}
   and that is a foo.
\end{+++}
%
<<exports: MyDomain>>=
foo: () -> ();
@

(OK, I guess the Perl script is going to be a bit longer.)

Now if you believe that it becomes unreadable then you forgot that we 
are actually writing in a literate programming style. All the empty 
lines above should be filled with your ideas and explain why this or 
that function is needed here or there, what your overall design is etc.

> Wouldn't it be nice if ALLPROSE treated both occurrence
> of ++ comments the same way?

NO. A strict NO. The reason is,

a) if I allow several ways for the user, he/she has to deal with several 
ways to write the documentation. Such a flexibility steepens the 
learning curve and complicates the code that has to deals with the 
extraction of the documentation

b) documentation is documentation why would you want to write +++ in 
front of each line if you can have it in a Latex environment? Code 
chunks should be code chunks, why would you want documentation inside 
it? Let's keep it simple.

c) If someone happens to write +++ comments inside code chunks ALLPROSE 
simply considers them as code (they are in a code chunk), but if you go 
all the way down, ie, compile the .spad.pamplet or .as.pamphlet file 
into a library then extract the +++ comments from the .ao files in that 
library, ALL the +++ comments are there. ALLPROSE simply doesn't use 
them while it is compiling to dvi. If you go the long way

.nw -> .as -> .ao -> (extract +++ comments) .tex -> .dvi

then everything would be there, but the result is the API description only.

Yep. Going the 'long way' is exactly that. But I have not yet written 
the AldorDoc tool to do the "extract +++ comments".

Somehow it seems that you are not using "\usepackage{noweb}".
The last three commands should be defined in there.

I am not going to invest my time in such legacy stuff. Let HyperDoc work 
as it is now and for new code use newer technology. We have webbrowsers 
meanwhile.

The file bookvol1.tex I downloaded doesn't explicitly request such a
file. I guess it should have be requested indirectly elsewhere.  -eitan

1) Write pamphlet files containing embedded Axiom commands that
   generate output that becomes part of the literate programming/
   mathematics document in a collaborative wiki-based environment.

2) Search and display these document online in a web browser as
   efficient HTML/MathML/jsMath etc. PDF and DVI still seem very
   awkward in comparison to web pages although they have a more
   reliable presentation.

3) Generate hyperlinks related to program call and inheritance
   structures like ALLPROSE and hyperdoc. Browser through the
   Axiom library online.

4) Other aspects as discussed in this thread.

> *) where can i see examples

We do have some related examples:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSagePamphlet

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/Endpaper3

See also the Up/Down navigation left sidebar on each Axiom
Wiki page (except FrontPage). In some case the Topic/subtopic
links reflect the structure of the Axiom library - this could
be made more so.

Probably 0/0. This is open source, remember?

This is open source, remember? ;) Consult the axiom-developer
email list archive. See also

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MathAction

(but you knew that :)

The reason why I asked: "Are Axiom developers and users really
motivated to use this sort of thing?" is because no one has
shown very much motivation so far. :( I am beginning to
seriously wonder if investing more time in better tools is
really worth the effort. It seems that we are still as stuck
in the old situation where (almost) the only people who use
the tools are the people who built them, e.g. MathAction and
ALLPROSE. And I guess what I really want to do is just that...
which is probably the reason I have been feeling so conflicted
lately.

I am amazed (and pleased) to see the amount of effort going
into the development of Sage. I am disappointed at the rate
of progress in Axiom. I worry about the delay in the open
source status of Aldor. I am disappointed that in the Sage
project I see some things that Axiom does very well being
re-invented badly. I am thinking about the best strategy for
the survival of a legacy project like Axiom when something
old made new (Sage) can attract so much interest. I am
tempted to suggest that hooking Axiom to the Sage bandwagon
as soon as possible might be the best idea. But that makes
Axiom seem subordinate when I really believe that it does
many things better even though it was designed nearly 30 years
earlier. Which rather leads off-topic, I have to admit...

--------

For an example pamphlet file on the Axiom Wiki that uses the
sagetex.sty file, see:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSagePamphlet

For stand alone use one does

  $ latex example.tex
  $ sage example.sage      <--- created by first pass
  $ latex example.tex      <--- reads output from sage

to generate the dvi file containing embedded Sage output.

Something similar is done by the graphviz.sty package but
in that case is used \write18 in order to directly issue
shell commands so the intermediate step is hidden.

You can get the source of the version of 'axiom.sty' that is used
on axiom-developer.org here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/axiom.sty

I believe this is the same as the version in the current Axiom source
distribution - at least it was as of last fall.

It's been a while since I looked at this, but yes it appears
that Tim has merged the noweb.sty into this file.

Bill Page.

There has been some usage Bill - I really like what MathAction was able
to do with that Emacs file I worked on a while back.  The primary
reason the units work isn't on MathAction yet is there isn't any code
to speak of yet.  There is other interesting code on MathAction -
Guess, for example.

I guess my first question is "What usage had you envisioned?"  A
broader audience for Axiom is going to take many years.  Most people
want to use the tool rather than work on it, and we are nowhere near
that stage as a project.  Axiom can be used to do other work, but it
doesn't look or feel like a modern program and that's going to have an
impact.  I think SAGE is getting a fair bit of attention because it
looks more "familiar" to people.  When I look at this: 
http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/screen_shots/.html/37a.html or
http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/screen_shots/.html/ec-soya.html
my first thought is "that looks a lot like Maple."  Now it probably
isn't all that similar when you get down to it, but that's my first
thought.  I think the SAGE project looks like it is doing some very
interesting work, but it has not yet withstood the test of time.

At the bottom of the SAGE website is this:
"Work on SAGE is partially supported by the National Science Foundation
under Grant No. 0555776."

That helps, and being centered at a university also helps - after all,
in one sense Axiom has very few links to academia in terms of
sponsering/patronage.  Most of us have something else as our primary
responsibility, so there is less intense, focused effort on Axiom. 
Also, SAGE doesn't have to go through the process of bringing code from
thirty years ago up to modern standards, which is a lot of work and is
less "sexy".

> I worry about the delay in the open source status of Aldor.

I think this is probably the biggest single holdup.  We don't have much
serious work on SPAD code because we all think and hope it will
eventually have to become Aldor code.  We don't want to start the
SPAD->Aldor (plus actual literate documents with academic research and
theory background as opposed to source code in a pamphlet file) because
if for whatever reason Aldor DOESN'T become open source the way we need
it to be then we are back to square one, and all the Aldor based work
becomes marginalized.  Then we have to turn the SPAD compiler into
Aldor and add the improvements we need.  Statements made earlier on the
list seem to indicate that such a project might not be workable, which
would leave Axiom in a rather precarious position.  All of this
uncertainty does not help Axiom in becoming a major "player" in either
open source or academia.

It's easier to start a new project than understand an old one.  At
least in the beginning.

> as soon as possible might be the best idea.

I don't think so, personally.  SAGE is new, and has some impressive
pieces, but it's long term success is not decided.  Axiom has the hard
parts - the core mathmatical logic, the type system, the focus on
combining research and code.  We don't have the sexy GUIs and notebook
interfaces, but they will come in time.

It's a long standarding problem in computers generally that newer and
prettier is always seen as better.  That's I think been due largely to
the increases in physical hardware power that people have seen, and the
benefits that provides in terms of usability.  The core designs of
software, algorithms, and systems are more timeless than that.  TeX has
been and continues to be the best typesetting solution available for
scientific papers, decades after it was written.  Despite this, it is
not as widely used as one would expect.  I think that rather than say
Axiom was designed 30 years earlier, we should say that it takes
decades to make the kind of program Axiom is and wants to become.  This
isn't Yet Another Editor - this is rocket science, the TeX of
mathematics software, if we do it right.  The space program didn't look
very sexy either early on (except a) people knew the goal was the moon
and b) rockets blowing up is more interesting than software crashes)
but everybody paid attention when it starting doing really amazing
stuff.  I think Axiom is like that - we're in the conference room
working on blackboards right now.  Drawing blueprints and looking at
the technologies we want to use, what we have available, and how it all
works together.  We'll start getting press when we start doing stuff no
one else can do, and everyone WANTS to do.  Things like being able to
answer the question "why should I trust this result" by saying "here is
a proof generated for this result that was checked in ACL2/COQ/Isabelle
and you can also either check by hand or in any of a dozen other
industrial strength proof checkers."  In the end, if we do what we are
trying to do, the question people will be asking is why would you use
anything BUT Axiom.  The problem is, that's never easy.  

Cheers,
CY

For my own courses, I've been preparing materials for using Axiom as

do you mean you have class material with Axiom as the main CAS?  

Mostly my topics include polynomial systems (of course), hybrid
numeric/symbolic techniques, algorithmic differentiation (I know
existing pakcages in Maple, and I've written some for my own uses),
geometry, etc.

No, I don't teach currently. But still, maybe I can help with specific things.

I agree in principle -- and that is what I tried to do.
However:
  (1) At the moment, Axiom does not look simple to build/install
      despite efforts in that direction;

  (2) the extension language seems to have a very fuzzy definition,
      when compared to other recent versions of CASes.

Particularly, with respect to (2), I have become unimpressed by the
Aldor mic-mac and the sort of self-infliged paralysis we have put
ourselves into (e.g. don't improve SPAD compiler, because something
better might come out of the blue).

I have less than a week left, so I'll try to use it as best as I can.

I agree, unfortunately. I'd be very very happy if it would be possible to make
SPAD understand a greater subset of Aldor. However, I have no idea how.

Thus, for the time being I write my stuff in SPAD, and I hope I write good
stuff. Meanwhile my program found quite a few -- previously unknown -- formulas
for sequences in sloanes encyclopedia :-)

If I can help with specific things, don't hesitate. I can understand your
frustration very well.

I am sure that you do not doubt that I am a strong supporter
of Axiom, but I must say that if I were you I probably would
*not* use Axiom to introduce students to symbolic computation.

There is of course the question of what you mean by
"introduce" and about the level of sophistication (or not)
of the students. If my intention was to demonstrate
(truthfully) just how hard using a computer to do mathematics
really is, then I think Axiom might be good place to start.
But if your purpose is to give (a mostly false) impression
of how easy it is, then the Maple and Mathematica sales
literature would probably make a good handout for your first
seminar. ;)

I think that at the root of this problem is really an issue
recently addressed by Steven Watt.

Gaby would like to introduce his students to "symbolic
computation", but really Axiom (and Aldor) are not very
good at this -- by design. Axiom however does excel at
"computer algebra".

In the paper:

http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~watt/pub/reprints/2006-tc-sympoly.pdf

Making Computer Algebra More Symbolic (Invited), Stephen M. Watt,
pp. 43-49, Proc. Transgressive Computing 2006: A conference

Symbolic Computation versus Computer Algebra, Stephen M. Watt,
Proc. 2006 Conference on the Applications of Computer Algebra,
(ACA 2006), June 26-29 2006, Varna, Bulgaria.

Steven presented this distinction:

"We observe that ``symbolic computation'' and ``computer algebra''
are really two different things and that neither one sufficiently
addresses the problems that arise in applications.  Symbolic
computation may be seen as working with expression trees
representing mathematical formulae and applying various rules=20
to transform them.  Computer algebra may be seen as developing
constructive algorithms to compute quantities in various
arithmetic domains, possibly involving indeterminates. =20

Symbolic computation allows a wider range of expression, but
lacks efficient algorithms.  It is often unclear what is the
algebraic structure of a domain defined by rewrite rules.
Computer algebra admits greater algorithmic precision, but is
limited in the problems that it can model.

We argue that considerable work is still required to make
symbolic computation more effective and computer algebra
more expressive.  We use polynomials with symbolic exponents,
e.g. $x^{n^2 + n} - y^{2m}$, as an example that lies in
the middle ground and we present algorithms for their
factorization and gcd."

-------------

I think Steven's thesis is a philosophically hard one for
mathematicians to accept but computer scientists in general
have developed a much more refined, and at the same time more
concrete, notion of "type" and "structure" as fundamental to
computer programming. So they have an easier time to accept
this view.

Under this distinction, Mathematica, Maple, Maxima, Reduce
are *symbolic* computation systems. They are designed to
manipulate expressions in a primarily linguistic and pragmatic
manner as dictated by the underlying mathematics.

A computer algebra system on the other hand, emphasizes
structure over language. For example a polynomial in Axiom
is a specific (abstract) data structure object with certain
very specific designed-in properties and operations. It only
has a symbolic representation during input and output. It
is this metaphysical view of mathematics as dealing with
concretely realized abstract objects (as implemented in a
computer) instead of merely manipulating formal systems of
symbols, that is at the root of this debate.

As we have discussed in several different contexts, Axiom's
"Expression" domain constructor is an attempt to provide Axiom
with some (limited) symbolic computational ability. Unfortunately
it is also one of the most complex and problematic domains in
Axiom. I think the reason that this is true is directly related
to the difficulty of merging these two points of view about
computation.

So presenting students with Axiom ends up confronting them
almost immediately with this difficult and largely unresolved
problem.

Although I am also a supporter of Maple and (at least in years
past was) quite active as a beta test volunteer during Maplesoft's
annual beta test cycles, I think choosing Maple (or Mathematica)
to introduce students to symbolic computation is also a mistake
since as commercial products they both try hard to give the
impression that this problem is solved.

Your prudence is justified, but since you must teach students
symbolic computation this fall, what should you do?

I think the truth hurts. :) And that is why one is sometimes
forced to teach in a somewhat less than optimal ways.

I have been trying to understand the reasons for the apparently
phenomenal success of the Sage project. Certainly the enthusiastic
personalities of some of the principle developers such as William
Stein and David Joyner is one factor, but more importantly perhaps
is the fact that Sage seems to take a sort of "middle ground" in
this "symbolic versus algebra" debate. By choosing a dynamic
strongly typed interpreted language like Python as the underlying
glue, it can in fact straddle these two worlds. Although there
remains considerable skepticism over whether it can do so in a
sufficiently efficient manner. Certainly only a few years ago
this approach would not have been technically viable due to the
lack of sufficient computer resources to waste. But the days of
Tim Daly's "peta-computer" are fast approaching and as Axiom
developers we need to take a close look at the consequences.
I think one of the consequences is Sage.

On the other hand, I think one might reasonably characterize
the design of the programming language Aldor as an earlier
and more formally correct approach to solve the same problem.
Unfortunately for completely non-technical reasons Aldor seems
to have lost at least the first round of this fight.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I hate to say this, but I think Bill made a good point about Axiom
probably not being the best way to introduce folks to computer algebra.
 I myself came to Axiom only through 1st Mathematica and then Maxima. 
Looking back on it, the benefits of Axiom become more apparent when you
start to reach the limits of what other systems are easily able to
accomplish (I didn't necessarily reach mathematical limits, but
certainly units in Maxima brought up some issues that made me think
about things differently.)

I'm not a teacher (only done a few labs over the years and a bit of
tutoring) but if I were to offer a suggestion (just what you needed ;-)
I would say this:

1.  Start by introducing either Maxima using the wxMaxima interface or
perhaps Yacas.  Either of those will probably be less intimidating to
students up front, and their limitations will not be readily apparent. 
Their prior experience with calculators will map to either of these
systems reasonably well - they will most likely be less intimidated if
they don't need to comprehend what a "type" is or why it matters up
front.

2.  Develop the students by gradually exploring more of the potential
of the first system, and take them to some problems that "symbolic
computation" doesn't handle so well.  I.e., show them both the utility
of symbolic computation (which the commercial success of Mathematica
and Maple prove is considerable) and its limitations.  This is good
both for showing the limitations of the approach and also why computers
can't substitute for an educated brain.

3.  Then, later on in the course, introduce them to a more formal
approach that avoids these limitations.  Most will probably not be real
excited about this because it will look harder (being precise is always
hard work ;-) but most will probably remember and if, in the future,
they begin to do work that would benefit from Axiom's more rigorous
approach they will know both about Axiom and why it might be better.

Of course, that was easy to say and hard to do.  Just a thought, for
whatever it may be worth.

Cheers,
CY

Opps - yes, that would make a difference.  For a minute I was back in
the undergrad physics lab showing people Mathematica again ;-).

Thanks.  I always thought this was a weakness of high schools in
particular - they don't do a good job of explaining why the students
can't just "use the calculator all the time and skip all of this". 
Undergraduate work didn't really have that problem so much, but I still
think the allure of programs like Mathematica makes it important to
demonstrate what the problems of relying on them are.  (Ironically, it
is making a system that CAN be depended on that is one of the
directions I would like to see things head, but I do agree there are
any number of reasons for an educated human brain being indespensible.)

No problem - glad they made sense :-).

For those of you not on or watching the Aldor list, there was a
discussion some days ago by some of our key players about it being time
either to bring the SPAD compiler up to a standard that supports what
we need or begin a re-implementation of Aldor.  With that in mind, I
have a couple of questions:

1)  If we want to bring things up to the Aldor standard, what do we do
about literate documentation?  In the Aldor User Guide (which IIRC has
the formal Aldor language specification somewhere in the back) are the
following tidbits:

"No part of this Manual may be reproduced, transcribed, stored in a
retrieval system, translated into any language or computer language or
transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical,
photocopying, recording or otherwise, without the prior written
permission of the copyright owner."

That would seem to rule out our incorporating this into Axiom as a
literate documentation of any sort.  In fact, if you interpret this
strongly, just downloading it and printing it seems to be an issue.  I
assume this is not what they were after but regardless we seem to be
out of luck.

I dislike the thought of drifting away from the Aldor community as far
as language goes but the above restrictions are going to make it a bit
tough to make something that is documented and compatible with Aldor. 
(In particular, if we can't reproduce the language definition in the
back, how are we supposed to formally describe the lanaguage in Axiom?)

"Aldor, AXIOM and the AXIOM logo are trademarks of NAG."

Axiom we presumably have permission to use (since we're calling our
project Axiom, after all) but Aldor we don't have permission to use so
whatever we do develop calling the result Aldor might not be the best
move.

2)  If we take SPAD as a start, use Aldor as a source of ideas, and
roll our own improvements and docs (either keeping the SPAD name or
calling it something else) that would avoide the problems above, but
that leaves the more mundane issues:  how to proceed and what actually
needs to be done/documented/designed.

3)  Whatever happened to the implementation of Aldor in Aldor that was
mentioned on the list some time back?  Was that for real and if so is
it available?

Cheers,
CY

I have been using, for a week now, "Bemol" as a code-name for a

conducting.  When ee find it unembarrsing enough we will send the

Here is another defintion:

  ./configure
  make

It works great in the Axiom Silver build_improvements branch.

Thanks, Gaby.

Chudnovsky was not making the distinction between "symbolic
computation" and "computer algebra" that Steven Watt is making
in the papers that I cited previously. Perhaps Gaby, you were
also was using "symbolic" in this more general sense? Still I
believe that Steven's distinction is relevant and worth making
when comparing Axiom to it's alternatives.

The Chudnovsky brothers are certainly prolific and well known
mathematicians - particularly when it comes to computing pi to
high precision. I think it was great that Axiom received such
an endorsement from them.

Gregory Chudnovsky was a contemporary of Richard Jenks, one of the
original developers of Axiom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chudnovsky

http://www.poly.edu/faculty/chudnowskygregory/index.php

http://www.math.poly.edu/research/gchudnovsky_publications.phtml

But one should keep in mind that in spite of a very considerable
investment by Numerical Algorithms Group in a completely new user
interface (based on Techexplorer) and extensive work on integration
of Axiom with the NAG numerical libraries, Axiom was a commercial
failure when placed in direct competition with Mathematica and
Maple from 1991 - 2001.

The quote from Chudnovsky above and in fact the entire Axiom book
from 1992 was clearly part of the marketing strategy for Axiom
at that time. I wonder what Dr. Chudnovsky would write today if
asked to compare the Axiom open source project to other open
source projects and the commercial counterparts?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Which assertion?

1) That making the distinction drawn by Steven Watt between
   "symbolic computation" and "computer algebra" is important for
   understanding the difference between Axiom and systems like
   Mathematica and Maple.

2) That Axiom is not particularly well suited for teaching introductory
   symbolic computation.

3) That Axiom was not designed primarily to do symbolic computation
   (in the sense defined by Steven Watt) but rather to implement the
   computer algebra in a manner which today we would probably call
   and object-oriented approach.

Or was it something else that I said?

On the contrary, I do not think I am "painting it into a corner".
I agree with Steven Watt (I hope I am not overstating his views.)
that the proper foundation for all mathematical computation is really
the kind of computer algebra implemented by Axiom and Aldor. Pure
symbolic manipulation of expressions is just another domain
(SExpression) in Axiom. The fact that it is not particularly well
developed in Axiom is because the Axiom developers were largely
concerned with other issues. The Expression domain constructor (not
to be confused with SExpression!) in Axiom was an early and still
incomplete attempt to provide Axiom with some of the abilities to
symbolic manipulate symbolic expressions like Maple and Mathematica
while retaining some underlying general algebraic structure. It
seems clear from Steven Watt's paper that this is still "research
in progress".

??? Axiom wasn't really "hibernating" until 2001 and it became
open source in 2003.

Do you think Axiom ever really had a "leadership" role? Certainly
as a research project at IBM up to about 1992 it was far ahead of
it's time in both mathematics and computer programming language
design. I know that experience with Axiom influenced the designs
of both Maple and MuPad. But I seriously doubt whether it is
possible for the Axiom open source project to regain that status.
Although I must admit the very fact that *you* are interested in
pursuing this work is very encouraging to me. :)

Could you explain what you mean by "retroactively used to redesign
its past foundation"?

what you said only reinforces the perception I have had since some
time now, from discussions on this list.

well, between 1995 (when I first heard of it, and later got
presentation by Stephen about A# at FRISCO workshops, and repeated
"conversion attempts" from colleagues -- mostly French you suspect) and
2002, nearly nothing  widely appreciated happened to Axiom -- contrast
that to other CAS on the market.  I call that deep hibernation; you
may call it differently. 2002 was when Tim came to Lyon putting Axiom
hard forward at the international workshop on open source CAS :-)

As a *principled* CAS, yes.

That is different from being leader in terms of number of users or
sale.

My understanding of your comments is that "people tried to show Axiom
as competing symbolic computation systems, it fails.  Let's try to
present it as not having anything to do with that, by design."  I
don't believe Axiom's foundational and design principles can be
meaningfully understood that way.  I don't believe earlier failure had
to do with the fact that Axiom was presented a symbolic computation
system.  But I suspect all have our own religions and beliefs :-)

You need this in patches.lisp.pamphlet:

         (setq $current-directory (truename (user-homedir-pathname))) )
 goes to

         (setq $current-directory (namestring (truename (user-homedir-pathname)))))

OK, I've made delete-file remove directories, and provide an errno
explanation on failure.  In Version_2_6_8pre.

Lisp has a bit of a different idea on some of these things.
probe-file, delete-file, open-file, etc. are not supposed to work on
directories, it appears, in keeping with some olden days in which
directories were not accessible as files on the fs.  I'm too busy now
to try to provide another function, so I hope this will do.

I though you had problems renaming, not deleting?  I have not done
anything here (yet).

Also, we build xgcl now the old fashioned way, so you might not need
--disable-xgcl anymore.

Take care, and thanks so much!

> I agree with Steven Watt (I hope I am not overstating his views.)

I heard about Symbolic Computation vs. Computer Algebra first at the 
Dagstuhl seminar http://www.dagstuhl.de/06271/ .

I must say for me I was first a bit puzzled by this distinction, but no 
matter how you name the two distinct ends there is a difference. And we 
all know that.

We are more on the structured side (computer algebra) and most other 
systems just deal with expressions (symbolic computation).

Interestingly, there was a question after his talk which started by...

   I am not sure that I understand your distinction between Symbolic
   Computation and Computer Algebra ...

It seems that people are spoiled by all the typeless systems and usually 
SC and CA are understood to be the same or CA is a subtopic of SC. I 
haven't heard before somebody putting emphasis on a distiction wrt 
structure.

I believe there is need for both ends.

And no matter how strongly typed Axiom will be, it must provide a nice 
way to deal with arbitrary expressions. But it should allow to add more 
and more structure to these expressions as the user understands the 
mathematics behind it.

Sorry. I did not mean to imply that Axiom and Aldor are not good
"by design". Certainly a lot of effort went into making Axiom
with Aldor the best possible tool for doing general mathematics by
computer. The point I was trying to make was that the basic design
of Axiom was such as to emphasise mathematical *structure* over
linguistically oriented formal symbolic computation. It is clear
from the early literature on Axiom that this was a deliberate design
choice. Other early systems being developed at the same time, such
as Reduce, took the opposite view.

Could you explain what you mean "the perception you have had"?
Do you mean that idea that I am (we are?) are "painting Axiom
into a corner" by emphasising how it differs from some other
systems? I don't understand why you would think that.

On the contrary this was the period of time when NAG was investing
a lot of time and money into developing Axiom as a commercial
product. An entirely new and I think potentially quite revolutionary
user interface was developed. Axiom was ported to a new lisp environment
that permitted Axiom to be delivered on Windows. And the numerical
abilities of Axiom were greatly extended. Perhaps it is true that this
is not now "widely appreciated" but I think that is only because it
turned out that NAG decided to abandon it's attempt to market this
new version of Axiom. :(

Unfortunately when first Aldor and then later Axiom were made open
source very little of the innovative work done by NAG during this
period could be made available in the open source release due to
licensing restrictions. :( :( :(

Yes. I call that a "damn shame". :)

Yes. My understanding is that Mike Dewar from NAG had been looking
for someone willing to take on Axiom as open source for some time
when Tim stepped forward. Thank you Tim.

I think that is an unfair assessment of my statements.

I did not say that. The reasons for Axiom's failure as a commercial
product were no doubt very different and largely non-technical.

Yes I suppose, but what does that have to do with Axiom?

Yes.

For the distinction is more about how types are used and viewed.  It
it more at the level of our -approach- to the subject (computattional
mathematics and logic).  I would not name weather prediction science
differently just because it uses software written in Fortran instead
of, say, Ada or vice versa.

Clearly, Axiom emphasis structures -- that is one of the aspects I

is -paradigmic- aspect of the subject matter, not a "semantically"
different field.

As I said, it is a perception I have had for some time, it is not a
perception given by the single message you just sent.

it is NOT a general matter of showing how different Axiom is; but it
is the matter of saying we are targetting a narrow field, with
unfocused means.

I think you are wrong. I think Steven Watt's paper provides
a very substantive example:

I disagree... but you're the teacher, not me. :)

When you have an opportunity I would like to see you expand
on this idea. I do not clearly understand what you mean by
"structure" in this case.

Hmmmm... keep in mind that NAG is described as a "not-for-profit
company". But I agree that money was a factor.

I do not agree that Axiom has "failed". Lack of commercial
success should not be construed as failure in this kind of
research.

>From my understanding NAG picked up Axiom as a way to sell their
numeric library. And when they partnered with Maple they withdrew
Axiom. The commercial success of interest is NAG's numeric library.
Axiom was just the sweetener.

Axiom succeeded commercially much more than I would have thought
since Axiom is really a research platform, not a production tool.
Amazingly, many hundreds of people paid for copies.

Having been involved with Axiom for so many years I find it interesting 
that my measure of success and other people's measures are not on the 
same scale.

I'm not interested in commercial success in any sense. A sudden
influx of money would certainly change the project and in ways that
would not necessarily be good, mostly because they would require
short term gain and thus short term focus. Nobody will fund us for
long term research. The very concept seems lost on funding sources.

Perhaps we need to re-invent the "patronage" idea from the middle ages.
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to work on Axiom full time. However,
only long-term research grants can minimize the harm.

Free and open source has given us the only method I know to conduct
really long term fundamental research outside the major universities.

My measure of success is that we conduct research into long-term
ideas such as literate computational math, provably correct 
mathematical algorithms, mathematically sound organization,
correct handling of provisos, etc.

The true measure of success is that we define, solidify, and
enhance computational science in ways that survive the next
hundred years. 

So I don't see Mathematica, Maple, Reduce, or any of the other
systems as competitors. Indeed, I don't know what it would mean
to compete since anyone trying to achieve the stated goals can
only enhance our understanding and thus help us along. Thats how
science works.

I encourage you to raise your eyes to the horizon and ignore the
rocky road under your feet.

Tim

that is well put; however, the rocky road needs to be dealt with, not

when you don't make room for them to make sure they can embark on the
long journey?

when, given the many times you have blamed NAG for the impact of its

How do you measure success?

I think the SPAD vs. Aldor question is probably the single biggest rock
at the moment.  I am very glad indeed to hear there is work on this
being done behind the scenes.

May I suggest as a constructive focus for current work that some of us
start to check out the SPAD compiler as a unit of the code and see what
might be done to start updating/polishing/figuring it out?  For myself
I couldn't even identify at the moment which parts of the code contain
the SPAD compiling system or how integrated they are with other parts
of the system.  I assume other folks have better knowledge of this, but
if we have a concrete task we can focus on it might help get this
moving in the right direction.  Gabriel, since you're working on some
of this already can you suggest constructive work that those less
skilled in the compiler arts might do to help you?  One thing which I
might be able to do something with - since there is a cmucl port out
there presumably part of that work must have gotten SPAD -> lisp
translation working on a more or less ANSI system - would figuring out
what those changes were and getting that work into the silver branch be
of some help?  Or is that kind of orthogonal to the main direction?

I don't have all that much time available, and less compiler skill, but
I would like to be able to do something more constructive and helpful
than writing emails :-).

Cheers,
CY

I did not mention Steven Watt as an appeal to authority (or did
you have some other authority in mind?) but I would be glad to
continue the discussion of his paper on this subject after you
get a chance to read it. :)

I do not blamed NAG for the commercial failure of Axiom. I am
sorry if I have somehow given you that impression. On the
contrary I think NAG and specifically Mike Dewar was extremely
generous to agree to license Axiom as open source and also
to support the idea of making Aldor available this way. The
impact of the commercial failure has been that Axiom is now
open source. From my point of view that is a positive out come.
I regret the loss of NAG's investment in the extensions made
to Axiom when it was a commercial product, but I think that was
largely due to restrictive licensing of non-Axiom components
beyond their control.

> I suspect you can just decree that these aspects of the

No. I think commercial conflict of interest has had a large
negative impact on both Axiom and Aldor. However since that
time open source has been proven as a viable alternative and
we are now in the process of recovering from these earlier
mistakes.

>

One measure of success that makes sense to me is the number
of people who actively contribute to the improvement of Axiom.
Another measure is the number of people who actually use Axiom
in their research and/or teaching. In terms of these measures
Axiom is not (yet) a failure but I believe that we could do
much better and I am disappointed with rate of change.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I am glad that you put it that way. :)

Hear, hear! I enthusiastically agree. But of course many universities
also continue to contribute directly to open source. Sage, for example
is very deliberately an open source project even though it is partially
funded by a university research grant. I think Axiom could benefit
from the exposure that it would gain by association with this project.

You are right. We *must* make room for them! Most of the things I
have been doing with Axiom over the last two years have been devoted
to precisely that goal. In my opinion, Gaby, with your work on the
Axiom Silver branch you are making an important contribution to the
same goal. I strongly encourage you to continue and for others to help
when possible. What else can we do to make more room?

But your question remains: "How do you get people on board for
long-term projects ... ?" I do not know the answer.

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. I will be silent for the next 5 days or so, not because I have
suddenly lost interest but only because I am away on a trip.

Do research. I define research as "doing something nobody in the world
knows how to do". 

People can do "big research". They can pick a rock that is distant and
hard to reach like 
  * "define B natural"
  * "define a new Aldor"
  * "define 
            n
    +-    -+
    | a  b |
    | c  d |
    +-    -+
  * "merge GAP and Axiom"
  * "document the algebra in ALLPROSE""
  * "define a complete, correct type coercion graph"
  * "define an [algebra domain] <=> [relational database] isomorphism
  * "symbolically solve for points on an elliptic curve"
  * "automatically compute the complexity of axiom algorithms"
  * "build a computer algebra test suite mechanism"
  * "define an algebra <=> graph isomorphism and reduction algorithms"
  * "add higher function support (eg polylogs) globally"
  * "define a "delta-epsilon algebra"
  * "architect a classroomt textbook mechanism"
  * "automatically derive a numerically stable approximate poly algorithm"
  * "define a "numerically stable simplification" algorithm
  * "create a cluster-aware axiom"
  * "create a parallel axiom"
  * "define a group theory type hierarchy"
  * "define a chemistry type hierarchy"
  * "organize an axiom video tutorial series"
  * "automatically generate flash-based time series graphs"
  * "define infinite reals"
  * "deeply embed literate algebra"
  * "entwin ACL2 and Axiom to do proofs"
  * "do automatic literate technical paper classification"
  * "define a NIST symbolic classification"
  * "automate a general bibliography mechanism"
  * "handle wave-equation mathematics"
  * "organize an existing math topic, collect papers, make them axiom-literate"
  * "add general genetic algorithm machinery"
  * "define propositional logic in axiom"

People can do "little research"
  * "expand SExpression to accept Maple syntax"
  * "expand SPAD to handle dependent types"
  * "implement symbolic summation"
  * "implement a clifford algebra"
  * "document an algebra domain in ALLPROSE"
  * "graph the existing algebra lattice""
  * "document the axiom domain to algebra database implementation"
  * "define tools for elliptic curve algebra"
  * "automatically compute the complexity of factoring polynomials"
  * "build a computer algebra test for a domain"
  * "define a way to graph polynomial operations and do them graphically"
  * "implement polylogs"
  * "handle stress/strain using a simple "delta-epsilon algebra"
  * "implement Strang's MIT linear algebra course"
  * "hand derive a numerically stable approximate poly algorithm"
  * "derive a "numerically stable simplification" polynomial simplifier"
  * "write a cluster-aware matrix domain"
  * "write a parallel processing matrix domain"
  * "extend axiom's group theory type hierarchy"
  * "implement a chemistry domain"
  * "make an axiom video tutorial"
  * "make a flash-based time series graph"
  * "implement an infinite real domain"
  * "implement literate )compile"
  * "decorate Axiom functions with ACL2-style axioms"
  * "investigate automatic technical paper classification"
  * "organize and name existing algebra for symbolic classification"
  * "create a build-time bibliography mechanism"
  * "accept and compute with feynman diagrams"
  * "pick an existing paper, make it axiom-literate"
  * "write a simple genetic algorithm solver"
  * "make the boolean domain work right"

Axiom is an ideal research platform and we're in the first 36 years
of the collision of mathematics and computation. Somebody just handed
us 36 years and 300+ man-years of research. We have complete and
total freedom to do anything we can dream.

> when you don't make room for them to make sure they can embark on the
> long journey?

Room? I see intellectual room in every direction. I could have a team
of computational mathematicians, add a new person every month, and
never live long enough to cover the space.

If you suddenly got a job working on Axiom and were given complete
freedom to do anything you want, what would you do?

Room really isn't the issue. Time and money are.


\begin{flame}

All existing computational math platforms have suffered from the 
total lack of vision by the traditional funding sources. The 
NSF/Universities/Research Labs (traditional funding sources) used
to consider "computer math" as leading edge research. They now 
consider it a "solved problem with commercial implementations" (NSF).
Or not a good revenue stream since it won't make money this quarter (IBM).
Or a cross-discipline crevice (Universities).

Traditional funding sources, (at least in the US, the rest of the world
seems rather more rational) seem unable to understand that the science 
of computational mathematics is hardly born yet. It's like the funders
have said "Plato discovered geometry... math is complete."

The NSF has a policy that "if there is a commercial implementation we
don't fund it" and feels that Axiom has something to do with MMA and
Maple.  We are being compared with the "commercial systems" and
considered losers.

"Do not compare yourselves to others or you will become vain or bitter"

\end{flame}


Axiom is a research platform in computational mathematics.
There is no competition, commercial or otherwise.
Real science is not a commercial enterprise.
Fund it with your time and energy.

> How do you get people on board for long-term projects

I don't know what motivates people to skip sunshine and wrestle
with hard problems. I'm irish. I don't do sunshine :-).

My primary job seems to be to carry this software thru the funding
dark ages. I'd make progress quicker if I could but it takes a LOT
of time to make sure it "just works". Most of the things I'm
actually working on will take years to complete. But I'm in no hurry.

yes, that is what counts; and you know what counts for tenure :-)
publish or prish; get grant or perish; etc. How does one convince NSF
to spend money in a legacy codes that only one person on the planet
understands, instead of building a new shiny tool? 

Axiom is an oportunity, no doubt.

[...good list of things to do snipped...]

interestingly, I spend a good of my night on only 5 points of your
long list before I saw it.  Three of them are listed "big" and the
other 2 are "small" :-/

| Room really isn't the issue. Time and money are.

Yes, that is part of what I call "room".  If we narrow sufficiently
the window for Axiom to shoot at the nearest target (e.g. "computer
algebra systems") we probably would have something for the immediat
future. I'm however less convinced that window is sufficient enough to
attract people that might contribute to many points on your list, and
attract fundings...

My first approximation of success is the number of users.  The number

not close to zero.

First of, thanks for your constructive suggestions.

I suspect one of the problem we need to solve is why we would want to
move to Aldor.  I mean, what is missing from SPAD that Aldor fixes and
that makes life easier to add new libraries to Axiom?  Surely people
woudl like to Aldor to have more.  What?

I know Martin has examples for dependent types.  Are those the only
things we are missing?  

My take is that the improvement to the SPAD compiler, first, needs to
be driven by needs we have for writing Axiom libraries.


We need a clearer type system and semantics description -- this
independently of whether we convert to Aldor or not.

Jaakko and I are interested in the dependent type system aspect, and
exploration of the notion of "concepts" (read mathematical structures)
as way to design generic and resuable libraries -- the bedrock of
Axiom.  Notice that aspect is mostly from -software engineering- point
of view (a problem that many mathematical software seem to suffer
from).  So that work is at the frontier of "applied type systems" --
so not hardcore computational algebra.  I think that is alright, since
most of Axiom developers and users are more concerned with
computational math than obscure compiler technicalities, and Axiom
needs that to be solved.  We settled on exploring the "B natural"
language.  For initial exploratory purpose, I simplified many points
and call the resulting language "Bemol". 

If people can look at the existing Axiom libraries (of planned libraries)
souces and say what they would like to express _directly_ -- assuming they
had the linguistic constructs -- that would help us shape directions
for the SPAD language and compiler.  It is important we aim at "ideal
expression", not just limited to what the current SPAD or Aldor
languages accept (hi Martin, Ralf).

Of course, we have gotten the lisp problem.  I don't volunteer to
attack that one yet.  :-/  However, I have the desire to target not
just Lisp, but C, C++ and probably Java or C#.  There are interesting
problems lurking there, but not none that is urgent. 

We need a clearer object model.  Currently, one has to read many boot
and lisp files in src/interp to start getting a little bit of sense of
what is going on.  I suspect the object model goes hand in hand with
the type system.

Thanks,

-- Gaby

Yes:

* types being first class objects, i.e., being able to have a list of Rings.

Examples:

f(m: INT, n: INT): PF n == m::PF(n)

[f(100, n) for n in primes(1,100)]

L := [PF(n) for n in primes(1,100)]

[a::P for P in L]

If we had dependent types, we could get rid of "Any" in the series
operations. If we have both of the above, Combinat will work in Axiom.

By the way, I think it is more important to make the interpreter understand
these things. Since:

* it would maybe be easier, I guess 

* we have to do it anyway: having the compiler understand won't help since we
                           couldn't use it in the interpreter

                           the aldor interpreter doesn't work too well

* we could use aldor meanwhile

* it will help us understand the issues involved, I guess

As far as I know, the SPAD implementation does not "conflict" with the Aldor
language. I.e., those concepts that are present work just as specified in the
Aldor User Guide.

So, this amounts to clarifying the Aldor User guide. Quite a bit of work has
been done on this side. Consult the archives or ask specific questions on
aldor-devel.

great!

I think, that the series stuff in the algebra(SPAD) library and our species
stuff serve as very good examples for the things I personally would like to
have. I would really like you to start on that one :-)

BTW, I think that there is no SPAD language, only a SPAD implementation. There
is however an Aldor language (more or less) and an Aldor
implementation. Fortunately, the SPAD implementation implements a subset (in
some sense) of the Aldor language.

> It is important we aim at "ideal expression", not just limited to what the
> current SPAD or Aldor languages accept (hi Martin, Ralf).

I think that we first need to explore the possibilities of the Aldor language
before we embark to modify it. When we do, I think the thesis of Nic Doye is a
good starting point, as well as FOCAL by Renaud Rioboo and THEOREMA by
Buchberger et al.,

> Of course, we have gotten the lisp problem.  I don't volunteer to
> attack that one yet.  :-/  

for the interpreter I guess that this is nearly a must (or was it BOOT?).Unless
you rewrite it from scratch. In this case, Aldor would be a natural choice, I
guess. Christian has a parser written in Aldor, but you know that.

So, that's a point for FOAM :-)

Ask yourself, what type that list will have and you realise that Aldor 
will reject that its compilation.

That is fine, though.

That is as problematic as the first list.

aldor-l@aldor.org to be precise.

That's a good one. There is an implementation of a non-language. How 
could someone have implemented that?

>> It is important we aim at "ideal expression", not just limited to what the
>> current SPAD or Aldor languages accept (hi Martin, Ralf).

I am all with you, Gaby, As you know, I would like to see support for 
formal specification inside the language. An Aldor program should allow 
to be fed to a proof checker, so I would like to be able to express 
invariants and all that stuff formally and not just in the documentation.

I also think so. You can completely forget about Aldor if you just want 
to generate different target languages. That is as I understand the foam 
business.

Quite unbelievable, isn't it? (Maybe I'm being too critical though. I wouldn't
call Basic a "language" in the sense I'm trying to establish here. I probably
should have said: specification)

Well, for this reason, and to work around a current Debian ia64 gprof
problem, I'm building xgcl now via the makefiles, at least for the
moment.

It is a very nice, light xwindows interface if you want to use it.
Most people now use a higher level toolkit built on top, such as gtk.
There are lisp wrappers for these, but not incorporated yet, and
likely will remain so unless someone is really using them.

Take care,

Greetings, and thank you so much for your very valuable reports in
email and on the web!  Please excuse the sluggishness of my reply
mechanism :-).

si::newline is a funtion which currently appears unused in the
debugging code.  Several functions in this file appear to have been in
progress when some interruption intervened, possibly the death of
Dr. Schelter.

I believe the whitespace issue is resolved in 2.6.8pre.  Please test
if you have a moment.

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl
cvs -z9 -q co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl

Please note that the Debian package of 2.6.7 (currently 2.6.7-18) is a
2.6.8pre cvs snapshot for autobuilder testing purposes. 

The large number segfault issue has also been resolved in 2.6.8pre,
though the division takes essentially forever.  In 2.7.0, we use gmp's
gcd for bignums, so your example finishes in seconds.  Given the time
2.7.0 is taking, perhaps it is worth migrating this one feature back
into 2.6.8.  Comments most welcome.  I know that the axiom people had
patches contributed doing essentially the same thing in the past.
There are many other gmp enhancements in 2.7, but I don't have time to
maintain two branches in this manner.

Regarding the windows gazonk files issue, as I do not have access to
such a machine, could one please check the variable
compiler::*keep-gaz*?  These files are supposed to be deleted
automatically unless this is set.  When using the
--enable-gcl-alt-link mechanism in maxima, this is (should be)
temporarily set to capture certain automatically compiled objects
in maxima, but it should not be left on in the final image.

The *read-base* error I've just fixed in 2.6.8pre by backporting a
function from cvs head.  In general, if you are in the mood, testing
with cvs head might be useful, though be warned much has changed and
is changing.

Are these all of our issues outstanding?  Someday, I'll figure out how
I can control that silly website from emacs, but for now I'll get to
closing those items soon.  If you feel in the mood and agree with the
expalnations here, please feel free to do so yourself.

Take care,

this patchlet rationalizes the logic for lsp/Makefile.  In particular,
it factorizes the various stanzas in lsp/Makefile.pamphlet, delegating
administrative bits to configure.

built and tested on an x86_64-suse-linux.

Nest step is to implement --with-gcl (similar to --with-noweb).

-- Gaby

2006-08-26  Gabriel Dos Reis  <gdr@cs.tamu.edu>

	* build-setup.sh: Regenerate lsp/Makefile.in too.

	* config/var-def.mk: New file.  Hold boileplate definition of
	standard Autoconf/Automake variables.
	* config/axiom.m4: New file.  
	* configure.ac.pamphlet: Include it.  Add configuration macro
	directory.  Use AXIOM_MAKEFILE from config/axiom.m4.
	Create lsp/Makefile at configure time.
	* configure.ac: Regenerate.
	* configure: Likewise.

	* Makefile.pamphlet: Move standard Autoconf variables to
	config/var-def.mk.
	(noweb): Fix thinko in TEXINPUTS substitution.
	(\subsubsection{LSPMakefile}): Remove, as lsp/Makefile is now
	created by configure at configure-time.
	(stamp-gcldir): Rename from gcldir throughout.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerate.

lsp/
2006-08-26  Gabriel Dos Reis  <gdr@cs.tamu.edu>

	* Makefile.pamphlet: Rework.  Factorize stanzas.
	(gcl-2.6.8predir): Rename from gcl-2.6.8pre.
	(gcl-systemdir): Rename from gcl-system.
	(stamp-gcldir): Rename from all.
	* Makefile.in: Generate.

  after noweb is untarred but before the make occurs.
  
- We have added a patch to the [[${SPAD}/obj/noweb/src/Makefile]]
- which does two things. First it uses [[${TMP}/null]] rather than
- [[/dev/null]] as we do not wish to write outside our own build tree.
- 
  We also patch the use of [[make]] to use [[${MAKE}]]. BSD style
  systems use [[gmake]] rather than [[make]] so we need to pass this
  information from above for the build to succeed.

  We build two lisps, Codemist Common Lisp (CCL) and Gnu Common Lisp (GCL)
  at the current time. Carnegie-Mellon University Common Lisp (CMUCL) is planned.
  
! When we first make GCL we the src/Makefile will create a marker file
! called gcldir. This file has the same name as the stanza to create
  GCL and thus will prevent GCL from rebuilding. We need to do this
  since we have no control over the GCL makefiles.
  
  The [[${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin]] directory is where the lisps get built.
- \subsubsection{LSPMakefile}
- We need to specialize the Makefile stanza based on the version
- of Lisp we plan to use. At the moment there are 3 GCL versions
- which run Axiom: 2.4.1, 2.5, and 2.6 These are incompatible versions
- so we have different patches against them. The details are in
- the lsp/Makefile.pamphlet file. Here we just decide which section
- to choose. The default is 2.4.1 but if the GCLVERSION is changed
- then the Makefile is rewritten to extract the later version.
- It looks for a chunk name that matches the version number.

The problem seems to be in the source bookvol1.tex file.  There are
quite a few usages of a list environment file of the form

   \begin{list}{} 
   \item ...
   \end{list} 

instead of the following form.

   \begin{list}{}{}
   \item ...
   \end{list} 

The correct syntax is:

 \begin{list}{label}{spacing}
 \item First item
 \item Second item
 ....
 \end{list}

Hi the patchlet below adds support for --with-gcl.

By default, configure will try to detect the presence of a gcl command
in the build environment, and use it.  You can instruct Axiom not to
autotect through the configure option --without-gcl.  Of course, you
can also explicitly tell Axiom the availability of GCL throught
--with-gcl.  All this follows standard GNU build tools semantics.

When I tried this, I had
  * an outright segmentation fault with a _separately_ installed
    GCL-2.6.8pre.  That SIGSEV was preceeded by failure to load
    sysdef.lsp from GCL-2.6.8pre installation.  Investigation revealed
    that indeed, that file is missing from the installation
    repository.  That seems a plain bug from GCL part.

  * a C compile failure, with a _separately_ installed GCL-2.6.7.
    Here is a snippet of the build log:
    [...]
      =====================================
      === algebra bootstrap complete ======
      =====================================
      compiling AHYP.spad to AHYP.NRLIB
      AHYP.NRLIB/AHYP.c:2:24: error: cmpinclude.h: No such file or directory
      In file included from AHYP.NRLIB/AHYP.c:3:
      AHYP.NRLIB/AHYP.h:4: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before 'LI2'

   The root of the error seems to be a failure of the C compiler (GCC)
   to locate the GCL-specific include file cmpinclude.h.  That file is
   present in the installation location

     /usr/local/lib/gcl-2.6.7/h

   so there seems to be a bug in the way the C compiler is called to
   compile the generated C codes -- that should add
   -I/usr/local/lib/gcl-2.6.7/h.  That is either a GCL bug (very
   likely), or an Axiom bug (not sure). 


Trying to fix all of that before commitring led me to learn about GCL
more than I wanted.  Consequently I postponed the investigation --
hopefully, those more familiar with GCL than me will come up with 
recommendations. 


Notice that none of the above problems manifests if one uses GCL as
part of the Axiom sources.  Consequently, until the above issues
are fixed, be sure to specify --without-gcl when invoking configure.

Built and tested on an i686-pc-linux-gnu.

Hi Cliff,

I'll copy that to axiom-developer, because it might start another 
discussion about dimensions in Axiom.

> So what we need, in effect, is types that have types.

You have NOTHING in Aldor that has no type.

> And we also need a * operation that can take two types that are
> themselves of type Dimension and generate a new type (also of type
> Dimension) as the output type, not determined in advance because the

Do you see a problem?

> Does Aldor permit this "types having types" behavior?

Of course.

Analyse the code below and ask if something is unclear.
I would very much like to see an upcoming dimensions package programmed 
along these lines. There are certainly lots of things just rudimentary, 
but as you can see, multiplying types to construct new types is not at 
all complicated. That is the power of having types as first class citizens.

Run the program via

 >aldor -grun -laldor -mno-mactext -mno-abbrev dimension.as
a = 2e-2*meter
b = 1.08000003e+4*second
c = 2.16000008e+2*meter*second
d = 6.48000001e+2*meter*second*second

And if you think that the numbers are wrong, then complain at aldor.org. 
My guess is that the SingleFloat implementation has a bug when it comes 
to printing floats.

Enjoy.

Ralf

PS: I think it gets a bit complicated to convince Aldor to believe that
Length*Time and Time*Length are not so different. With the code below 
these are different dimensions.

---BEGIN dimension.as
#include "aldor"
#include "aldorio"

macro Unit == String; -- for simplicity
macro R == SingleFloat; -- R could be a parameter to Dimension.
extend SingleFloat: with {
	integer: Literal -> %; -- to make input easier
} == add {
	integer(l: Literal): % == integer(l)$MachineInteger :: %;
}
import from R;

define Dimension: Category == with {
	OutputType;
	value: % -> R;
	unit: % -> Unit;
	bracket: (R, Unit) -> %;
	apply: (R, %) -> %;
}

AuxiliaryDimension: Dimension == add {
	Rep == Record(val: R, unit: Unit);
	import from Rep;
	(tw: TextWriter) << (x: %): TextWriter == {
		tw << rep(x).val << "*" << rep(x).unit;
	}
	value(x: %): R == rep(x).val;
	unit(x: %): Unit == rep(x).unit;
	bracket(r: R, u: Unit): % == per [r, u];
	apply(r: R, x: %): % == per [r * value x, unit x];
}

Length: Dimension with {
	meter: %;
	centimeter: %;
} == AuxiliaryDimension add {
	meter: % == [1, "meter"];
	centimeter: % == [1/100, "meter"];
}

Time: Dimension with {
	second: %;
	minute: %;
	hour: %;
} == AuxiliaryDimension add {
	second: % == [1, "second"];
	minute: % == [60, "second"];
	hour: % == [3600, "second"];
}

(*)(A: Dimension, B: Dimension): Dimension with {
	*: (A, B) -> %;	
} == AuxiliaryDimension add {
	(a: A) * (b: B): % == {
		[value a * value b, unit a + "*" + unit b];
	}
}

main(): () == {
	a: Length := 2 centimeter;
	b: Time := 3 hour;
	c: (Length * Time) := a * b;
	import from Length * Time * Time;
	d := c * 3 second;
	stdout << "a = " << a << newline;
	stdout << "b = " << b << newline;
	stdout << "c = " << c << newline;
	stdout << "d = " << d << newline;
}

main();
---END dimension.as

Indeed.  

At the logical level, as I have observed some time ago, there is an
inconsistency problem with Type:Type.  I'm wondering how Aldor gets
away with that.  Many languages (mostly functional) use stratified
types.

That question should be asked at aldor-l.

Can you construct a paradox that demonstrates the problem in terms of 
Aldor code? To me it looks like the class (not set) of all classes. 
Would there be a problem in class theory?

Hi Camm,

I'm experiencing a problem when installing GCL-2.6.8pre in a custom prefix.

Here are the details:

* check out cvs GCL-2.6.8pre

* configure --prefix=$HOME

* make # works fine

* make install # troublesome

the install fails with the following error:

chmod a+x /home/gdr/lib/gcl-2.6.8/gcl-tk/gcltksrv ; fi
if test "/usr/share/emacs/21.3/site-lisp" != "" ; then (cd elisp ; make install DESTDIR=) ; fi
make[2]: Entering directory `/media/usbdisk_2/software.src/GCL/2.6.8pre/elisp'
mkdir -p /usr/share/emacs/21.3/site-lisp

cp: cannot create regular file `/usr/share/emacs/21.3/site-lisp/sshell.el': Permission denied


The problem seems to be that GCL wants to install elisp files in
$(EMACS_SITE_LISP).  User installing GCL (like me, or as part of another
package like Axiom) may not have write permission to that directory.
Any particular reason why the elisp files are not installed in
$(prefix)/share/emacs for example?

Well, I think it's just that I'm not thinking clearly enough yet in
Aldor.  I was thinking maybe something like (warning, pseudocode, maybe
even conceptually wrong)

define Dimension: Category == with {
     "*" : (%,%) -> %
}

DerivedDimension: AbelianGroup with {
     "*": (A: Dimension, B: Dimension) -> C: Dimension
     "^": (D: Dimension, E: Integer) -> F: Dimension
} == add{
     ***Some A*B operation that returns C according to Abelian rules***
}

where the return type of the "*" operation is C and defined by
multiplying A and B, but A, B, and C all must be Dimensions.  Then,
Unit would be a Rep with a name unit and a type of dimension Dim, and
multiplying units u1 and u2 would result in a name of 
unit1:String*unit2:String -> unit3:String with a type Dim1:Dimension *
Dim2:Dimension -> Dim3:Dimension.  Quantities then would have a rep of
a value (integer, float, what have you) and a Unit, and the type of a
Quantity would be Union(Float,Dimension) or something of the sort.

Thanks!  I will study what you have done in more detail.  Am I correct
in that you are not actually "multiplying" dimensions in the Abelian
group sense but are combining the names of the types and the "*"
character?  (/me winces at what is probably a horrible description).

I think in an Abelian group aren't a*b and b*a the same?  I think
that's why the literature is more or less at a consensus that
dimensions should be modeled by Abelian groups over the multiplicative
operation.

You are correct that there is a potential inconsistency.

We avoid Russel's paradox by limiting the operations for
constructing and testing membership in type categories.

Note that many programming languages have the problem of
allowing types with no elements, which can lead to the type
theory equivalent of a division by zero error.

Aldor is no exception in this regard:  It is possible to construct
a domain with no effective way to make elements.  

These kinds of errors have to be seen as  bugs in programs, just as 
division by zero is a programming error and not an invalidation of
integer arithmetic.

First of all, forget these double quotes around * an ^. We are speaking 
Aldor here.

Then I actually see no reason for adding the "C:" and "F:" above.

Why would the type of a quantity be a union of Float and Dimension? You 
are not telling me that you must model dimensionless constants? These 
constants should be modelled as being of type Dimension. You did the 
same thing in your text. That is the dimension <1>. Am I wrong?

>>> Does Aldor permit this "types having types" behavior?
>> Of course.

That was for simplicity reasons. Of course, what I called Unit should be 
an multiplicative Abelian group. Also Dimension should be modelled a bit 
differently than what I did. Maybe one needs an extra wrapper domain 
that models the abelian group behaviour.

The problem is that it is not so terribly easy to construct a 
commutative type constructor. But one can certainly do it.

I can try. But I hope my small patch will still be accepted even if I
can't find the time to thoroughly document that function.

In any case, I'm not sure I completely understand what powern does.
I've looked at servarl power series manipulation routines already, but
I get stumped every time I run into this object: Y from
ParadoxicalCombinatorsForStreams. Can someone explain what it does?

Thanks.

Hello Camm, you wrote:

OK, thanks for the info. I resolved the Maxima problem
(I believe) by not calling si::newline (and calling a local
version instead, as with other Lisp implementations).

Well, operations with numbers like 255^(2^22) are fairly
rare, so I don't think it is worth the trouble to backport
the patch from 2.7.0.

In Maxima 5.9.3.99rc2 / GCL 2.6.7 on Linux, I find
compiler::*keep-gaz* is nil. So I guess that's OK.
I don't have a Windows box at hand, maybe someone
else can check that.

I notice the GCL version in the bug report is 2.6.5.
Was *keep-gaz* introduced after that?

Terrific!

> Are these all of our issues outstanding?

Well, the one other Maxima-related issue that I can see
(after scanning the GCL bug list) is bug #14367,
dribble file has newlines in wrong places.

Thanks a lot for all your hard work!

I just wanted to point out that you can give the Aldor Category "Dimension" an
algebraic structure. This is in fact one of the main advantages of Aldor over
SPAD.

The code will read roughly as follows:

Scalar: Dimension with {
        scalar: %;
} == AuxiliaryDimension add {
        scalar: % == [1, ""];
}

DimensionThing: Group == add {
        Rep == Dimension;
        1: % == per ConstantDimension;
        (x: %) * (y: %): % == per(x * y);
        (x: %) / (y: %): % == ...
}

Thus, each "element" in the domain DimensionThing has type
Dimension. Multiplying two dimensions gives you another dimension. The unit
(i.e., neutral) element is the "dimension" Scalar.

Keep in mind: in Aldor, types are first class. They even can be the elements of
a domain.

Martin

Hello Gaby,

I tested the build-improvements branch and if we build gcl the XLIB
(xgcl) package is compiled in (gcl and AXIOMsys are thus linked against
the X libraries). Don't know what you think about this, it's just a
remark.

Another thing, more important, is that if you stop the build process
after the creation of bootsys, do a make clean, reconfigure and remake,
the build process stops and complains about the fact that lisp can not
be found (with or without building gcl).

And of course many thanks for your work.


Greg

Yep, that is exactly what I called a wrapper domain in my previous mail. 
And note that the line

(x: %) * (y: %): % == per(x * y);

is wrong. It should read "per(rep x * rep y)" on the right hand side.
And note also that the * on the right hand side is the _domain 
constructor_ that I defined in the file dimension.as.

The main point is that one defines the various dimension domains like 
Length, Time, etc. on the top level with basically no relation to each 
other. In order to work with these things one creates another domain 
that has domains like Length, Time, Mass, etc as elements.

PS: Martin probably wanted Scalar = ConstantDimension. No?

Yes yes, you know me by now. Thank God there is somebody correcting me when
necessary! (honestly)

Yes. Isn't that synonymous?

yes, that is very annoying.  We don't have a good dependency at the
moment.  We should have one.  I know I had similar problem in the past
and I heared that it would NOT be recommended.  I think that is wrong.
We should have a dependency that make knows about.  That way we can
also have a parallel build (make -jN) -- Axiom just takes too long to
build.=20

I'm working in major restructuring of the makefiles.  I have class
today, so unfortunately I won't do much today.

But, please, list your priority about the build machinery.

Thanks!

Patch 50 is up in arch.

There are three major things of note.

FEDORA CORE 5

There is the Fedora Core 5 issue. There is a new branch of
the configure script that will tell you to put 'fedora5' as the
last directory on the AXIOM command thus:

  export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/fedora5

The issue is two-fold. First, there is an X library issue which
seems to require a special case for fedora 5. Renaud brought this
to my attention at ISSAC. I've tried to resolve this issue across
all of the platforms without success. Second, there is the GCL issue.




GCL-2.6.8PRE VS GCL-2.6.8PRE

There is an upgrade of the system to run on the latest GCL
but the patches are not compatible with the current axiom version
of GCL. Axiom's policy has been to use a 'stepping stone' approach.
That is, we keep the last version of GCL and the previous version
of GCL in the distribution in case the new version cannot be built
on some platforms.

In this case there is a bit of an issue because the latest GCL (2.6.8pre)
requires changes that are incompatible with the prior version of
GCL (2.6.8pre). As you can see there is no way to distinguish these
versions by name. They also cannot be distinguished at runtime.
So Axiom now has gcl-2.6.8pre and gcl-2.6.8pre2.

   (Gaby, how will automake handle this?)

The gcl-2.6.8pre is the old version, gcl-2.6.8pre2 is the new version.
By default the system builds on the latest (gcl-2.6.8pre2) version.




GCL-2.6.8PRE2 AND FEDORA CORE 5

It appears that GCL-2.6.8pre (latest version, which we call gcl-2.6.8pre2)
will not build on Fedora Core 5. Thus the Fedora 5 version will 
automatically build using the GCL-2.6.8pre version.

I have not yet had time to resolve this issue. It has been delayed
by a motherboard failure on my fedora 5 system which should be
resolved today.




NEXT STEPS

  *) update the CVS on savannah
  *) update the CVS on sourceforge
  *) create a diif list for SVN on sourceforge
  *) work with Gaby to apply patches to SVN Silver
  *) work with Camm to resolve Fedora 5 compile issues

OK.

I think I got ahead of myself - I was thinking about what I wanted to
happen at the unit level.  I agree that a dimension * a dimension is a
dimension, so C and F aren't needed.

Looking ahead to units:

Let's say I multiply meters:Length and seconds:Time together.  I want
to end up with meters*seconds:Length*Time, which is both a new unit and
a new dimensional type.

For this to work and generate the new type Length*Time, but not in
general allow Length*Anything as a new type, both Length and Time must
in turn be of type Dimension. (meter:Length:Dimension?)  So from the
point of view of meters*seconds, the resulting type is different from
BOTH of the input types and cannot be predicted - it must be
calculated.  So I'm not sure what the *: (%,%) -> % should look like
for units, because the type of none of the inputs to * are determined
in advance.  All that is known in advance is the type of the types of
the inputs - the types actually operating at the level of the *
operation are not known until the computation is made.

Manipulating Length*Time in dimensional analysis is much simpler - they
are both constants of type Dimension and return an expression that is
also of type Dimension, in the same way that 1*2 are integers and
return a result of type integer.  But meters*seconds is not so simple,
because meters of type length and seconds of type time multiply to give
meters*seconds of type length*time.  The governing behavior of the
legality of * for units is not the type of the unit but the type of the
dimension of the unit, and I'm not sure how to specify that.  That was
why I had *: (A: Dimension, B: Dimension) -> C: Dimension (which should
have been in the unit entry not the DerivedDimension entry), as a way
to try and express that the demand for type correctness is not at the
level of A, B and C (length, time and length*time) but that the type of
any type input into or returned out of the * operation must be of type
Dimension.  Otherwise, there are no constraints on the types that may
be multiplied, which would seem to be the same as saying that you can
multiply 1:Integer*2.0:Float*(2/3)Fraction as long as they are all
Numbers, and Integer*Float*Fraction would then become a new numerical
type for the value 4/3. (Note that this is different from the +
operator, which will need to enforce type not at the type of the type
level but at the A,B,C level -> length+time will fail, as will
length+anything where anything is any type other than length, whether
or not anything is of type dimension.)

Sorry if I'm saying this incorrectly, but hopefully my concern is
clear.

I'm not sure - I might have said that wrong.  I would argue that a
dimensionless constant has two components - the numerical value of the
constant, which has some numerical type, and the dimensional type <1>. 
The dimensional type <1> is what has the type Dimension - <1> is itself
a type as well - the type of a dimensionless constant *as a whole* is
<1>.  At least, I would like it to be - I had assumed that since the
numerical type of the constant number must be retained that would wind
up with the expression of the constant being some combination of the
two, but maybe that doesn't have to be the case.

That could be.

Yes, I think that is one of the challenges of this task.  The Sun team
deliberately chose dimensions and units to look at because they are a
challenge to represent in conventional type systems in most languages
(actually, impossible might be a better word - Sun basically made a new
one).  I am hopeful that Aldor can do it but it certainly will require
some not-normal ways of working with and generating types.

What do you think the code

main(): () == {
	a: Length := 2 centimeter;
	b: Time := 3 hour;
	c: (Length * Time) := a * b;
	import from Length * Time * Time;
	d := c * 3 second;
	stdout << "a = " << a << newline;
	stdout << "b = " << b << newline;
	stdout << "c = " << c << newline;
	stdout << "d = " << d << newline;
}

that I sent before represents?

Look at the line

        c: (Length * Time) := a * b;

It constructs a type Length*Time and imports the operations from that 
NEW domain. Only after that import it is clear what the * on the right 
hand side actually is. The * on the left and the * on the right hand 
side are terribly different. The first is of type

(Dimension, Dimension) -> Dimension

and the second of type

(Length, Time) -> Length*Time;

And my code is unable to do something like

Integer * String

because neither Integer nor String is of type Dimension, so the (first) 
* cannot apply.

Take your time and study my code in detail. At each step you should 
understand what it is doing.

For example, do you know why I could simply write

	a: Length := 2 centimeter;

? There is only a space between 2 and centimeter.

Hi Camm,

  GCL-2.6.9pre, checkout of cvs as of this morning, has problems
making new lisp image.  More precisely, the instruction

     % echo '(compiler::link nil "foo")' | gcl

has GCL die with the message

[...]
loading /home/gdr/lib/gcl-2.6.8/unixport/../xgcl-2/sysdef.lisp

Error: Cannot open the file /home/gdr/lib/gcl-2.6.8/unixport/../xgcl-2/sysdef.lisp.
Error signalled by PROGN.
Broken at SYSTEM::BREAK-LEVEL.  Type :H for Help.

Indeed the file sysdef.lisp is NOT present in the install directory

        /home/gdr/lib/gcl-2.6.8/unixport/xgcl-2/

it looks like the install machinery forgot to install it.

Thanks,

-- Gaby

| There are three major things of note.
| 
| FEDORA CORE 5
| 
| There is the Fedora Core 5 issue. There is a new branch of

| last directory on the AXIOM command thus:
| 
|   export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/fedora5
| 
| The issue is two-fold. First, there is an X library issue which

Is this issue related to missing libXpm?  Or is it a different one?


| Second, there is the GCL issue.
| 
| GCL-2.6.8PRE VS GCL-2.6.8PRE
| 
| There is an upgrade of the system to run on the latest GCL
| but the patches are not compatible with the current axiom version
| of GCL. Axiom's policy has been to use a 'stepping stone' approach.
| That is, we keep the last version of GCL and the previous version
| of GCL in the distribution in case the new version cannot be built
| on some platforms.
| 
| In this case there is a bit of an issue because the latest GCL (2.6.8pre)
| requires changes that are incompatible with the prior version of
| GCL (2.6.8pre). As you can see there is no way to distinguish these
| versions by name. They also cannot be distinguished at runtime.
| So Axiom now has gcl-2.6.8pre and gcl-2.6.8pre2.

Maybe we should talk to Camm to either make public numbered 
pre-releases or include the date of official preleases in the tarball
name. 

|    (Gaby, how will automake handle this?)

I'm afraid I have lost the distinctive features of old 2.6.8pre
vs. new 2.6.8pre.  If we need to run the system before knowing it is
bad then we're almost out of luck. 

[...]

| GCL-2.6.8PRE2 AND FEDORA CORE 5
| 
| It appears that GCL-2.6.8pre (latest version, which we call gcl-2.6.8pre2)
| will not build on Fedora Core 5. Thus the Fedora 5 version will 
| automatically build using the GCL-2.6.8pre version.

OK, if you decide in advance that Axiom won't use GCL-2.6.8pre2 then,
we can handle this based on the output of config.guess -- or
approximate it as you currently do on the golden branch.  But, again
I'm unclear about what the build failure is.  Could you elaborate?

| I have not yet had time to resolve this issue. It has been delayed
| by a motherboard failure on my fedora 5 system which should be
| resolved today.
| 
| 
| 
| 
| NEXT STEPS
| 
|   *) update the CVS on savannah
|   *) update the CVS on sourceforge

Can we have only one master CVS with the othe one rsync-ing? 

|   *) create a diif list for SVN on sourceforge

OK.

I'm not sure what the issue is about updating the gcl version numbers.
i was unable to find a way to distinguish the two cases except at build
time. There is no runtime #+ flag. However since I know which one I
need at build time I just set the correct version in the Makefile.pamphlet
fedora stanza.

> Can we have only one master CVS with the othe one rsync-ing? 

Two questions, why? and how?. It's only two cvs stores and 
it takes only a few minutes to update the second once the first
is complete.

At this time all of the CVS files are up to date.

I've checked out the SVN branch and will be creating a set
of diff-Naur files for you to look at.

Tim

Personally I think that if we don't use a package we can remove it. So
for gcl it can be removed from the lisp image and added later if
necessary. In fact there is also the TK package that Axiom doesn't use
but I don't know if and how it is possible to remove it.

I think so.

Yes the big part. A quick note, it would be great if a modified
src/algebra/*.spad.pamphlet file can be used by Axiom after a remake. In
fact I think that your work will fix that. More precisely actually (it
used to work in the past) if someone modify an algebra pamphlet file and
type make in the root directory the modified file is apparently compiled
but not copied to the mnt/linux/algebra directory. I have not
investigated this problem but it's really annoying when you want to add
some algebra files and modify them (I even don't speak about the
dependency issues).=20

I haven't no priority at all for this branch, it's not the silver
branch, it's a work in progress branch (as silver you can say). So if
there are some problems that will be fixed later because some
preliminary work has to be done it's not a problem. But what about
adding a file, say README.build-improvement, that quickly explain how to
build Axiom and lists the known issues, the workarounds and why not the
TODO (it can refer to the "gold" README for more information about
Axiom).

Aha.  
libXpm does not seem to be much appreciated these days among system
packagers.  It has gone through deprecation, active non-support,
tentatively replaced with xpm-nox, then came back again then gone.
Long term, it might be best just to find a different way to accomplish
what is currently done with xpm in Axiom.  I may be able to come up
with an Autoconf test (based on how we find X11), but that may take
some time.

I am not sure if this is the right track or not, but this error
does not occur if you build gcl with '--enable-ansi'. I believe
that this option is used on the Axiom Debian build which uses
a pre-installed gcl.

However after 'svn update' of the build_improvements branch,
my attempt to build Axiom using a pre-installed gcl built with
--enable-ansi fails with:

...

Fast links are on: do (use-fast-links nil) for debugging

It seems there may be other problems. Perhaps it might be a good
idea to review the Camm's Debian patches.

I think it might be the case that 'compiler::link' expects that
gcl is built with option '--enable-ansi'. At least in that case
I did not get the error you quote.

After repeat attempts with different options

  # make clean
  # ./configure ...
  # make

I observed that

  lsp/stamp-gcldir

is not being removed by 'make clean'.

I hate these stupid "stamp-xxx" files. Surely there is a way to
specify a proper dependency for gcl, no?

Thanks for your continuing work on this branch!

Tim,

It's too late for the midnight oil isn't it? ;)

As I understand it --enable-ansi in GCL does not require
that the source be ansi compliant but rather builds several
variants of the gcl binary, one of which is ansi compliant.

There is the GCL_ANSI env variable mentioned by Camm here:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-12/msg00276.ht
ml

whose abscense tells gcl to run in the non-ansi image.

At least, I did not get any error messages that specifically
suggested problems with non-ansi source.

Note especially Camm's suggested plan towards the end of his
email:

> 1) Mod GCL to
>    1) build axiom as is under ansi.  This is a simple conversion
>    of the in-package failure to a warning afaict. or=20
>    1a) ship both images starting with 2.6.8 everywhere.
>    2) remove compile-time memory limits in GCL.

Camm recently complete 2). I am not sure of the other items.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Aha; that is good to know.  Thanks!  Can we make the working

that goal that is not attained at the moment?

--disable-xgcl also fixes it -- that way, compiler::link does not get

I think I know the reason for this.  As I reproduced it yesterday but
did not get enough time to fix it -- and I spent my whole evening
chasing and fixing a stupid, mysterious kernel panic after a crash.

The above problem seems to come from the fact that astr.clisp needs
the boot compiler which was not built yet (or not found).  But the
build continued instead of failing. Later LISP found that the object
file astr.o was missing.  I think I fixed it.  I just need to find the
right "experimental directory" that has it :-( Sorry for that.

No, it's more complicated than that. The Axiom source is not ANSI
LISP compliant (yet) but GCL even in --enable-ansi mode apparently
accepts some non-ansi constructs. Plus even with ansi enabled GCL
consists of at least two binaries (at least on Debian), one of
which still accepts the older lisp standard.

It's confusing, and I admit I might well be confused by all this...
So it's best to get the straight goods from Camm.

Regards,
Bill Page.

You are right. So in addition to your change to
'gcl-2.6.8pre/o/unixfsys.c' in delete_file:

        if (unlink(filename) < 0 && rmdir(filename) < 0)
                FEerror("Cannot delete the file ~S: ~s.", 2,
                  path, make_simple_string(strerror(errno)));

and I added the following to rename_file:

#ifdef HAVE_RENAME
        /* Make sure we can rename */
        if (unlink(newfilename) < 0) rmdir(newfilename);
        if (rename(filename, newfilename) < 0)
                FEerror("Cannot rename the file ~S to ~S.",
                        2, vs_base[0], vs_base[1]);
#else
...

I am testing the build now.

Thanks.

Bill Page.

I think the fact that Aldor defines the type of Type as Type
is very interesting from a theoretical point of view and that
it is not correct to suggest that it implies any inconsistency
or even necessarily any fundamental limitation.

In mathematics it is often necessary to deal formally with
"very large" objects, for example, to be able to reason and
compute with things like streams and formal series or for that
matter even objects such as exact real numbers. These things
do not have simple finite representations inside the computer
yet we do have means to manipulate such objects in the Aldor
and Axiom libaries. Even larger objects such as categories and
the category of all categories can be effectively represented.

Non-well-founded set theory deals specifically with this kind
of situation. (Note: The term "non-well-founded" should not be
interpreted pejoratively, in the same way "imaginary" does not
imply any algebraic defect in reference to a number.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-well-founded_set_theory

I am particularly fond of the book by Barwise and Moss:
Vicious Circles: on the mathematics of circular phenomena,
CSLI Lecture Notes, 1996.

An earlier but very important reference is the book by
Peter Aczel, Non-Well-Founded Sets. Center for the Study of
Language and Information, CSLI Lecture Notes no. 14, 1988.

http://standish.stanford.edu/pdf/00000056.pdf

One of the ways of axiomatizing non-well-founded sets is via
"accessible pointed graphs". It seems to me that these graphs
also provide an excellent model for Types in Aldor and Axiom.

This is particularly evident in the Axiom library where there
are many inherent circular dependencies. Given the presence of
circulary dependencies and the potential for mutual recursion,
fixed point methods seem especially appropropriate for compiling
the Axiom library. It seems that the SPAD language leaves no
alternative to this process, but Aldor is able to compile some
mutually recursive definitions when they occur in the same source
file. And post-facto extension makes many (most?) cases of mutual
recursion over larger groups of library modules unnecessary. It
remains to be determined whether this is sufficient to implement
Axiom's library without any essential compromises.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/MutualRecursion

Further, it seems to me that in principle the concept of
bi-simulation introduced in the theory of non-well-founded sets
might provide an effective definition of equivalence for Aldor's
types.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Why? I would think it is an element (not a list) in a 
cartesian product of #primes(1,100) prime fields.

It's a perfectly good mathematical object in a cartesian 
product.

>"problematic" is an understatement. Sorry.

Ditto. The only problem I see that can't be handled is if 
you make it into a function of k:

[f(100, n) for n in primes(1,k)]

To have true dependent types means the compiler should be 
able to handle

[f(100, n) for n in primes(1,100)]

because the list primes(1,100) is computable at compile 
time and hence the prime fields can be constructed and 
their cartesian product too. prime(1,k) is a totally 
different ball game, but even that should be doable with 
generated code to instantiate the prime fields when k is 
given a value at run time.

I believe I need more explanations than the vague allusion to
co-inductive formalism.  Epigram, for example, faces the same issue, and
I don't think it is just mirage:

OOPs, I'm afraid that I was the only one who touched that function.

OK, if you like. But then I would like to see the definition of the 
bracket function. Can you give that?

I strongly believe you can't, because that would require Aldor to 
compute "primes(1,100)" at compile time. Which is currently not possible 
and if the compiler is allowed to evaluate it then it might run into an 
infinite loop (at compile time) since the "primes" function does not 
terminate as you would expect. Compile time evaluation in full 
generality introduces a way make it really hard to find bugs.

But anyway, maybe Aldor should allow compile time evaluation.

William is right, but I cannot believe that a construction like

[f(100, n) for n in [2,3,5]$List(Integer)]

would work.

[f(100, n), f(100, n), f(100, n)]

should be easily definable and give an element in the cartesian product 
of   PF(2), PF(3), and PF(5). But that is a finite construct and not 
done via Generator as above.

Initially, I believe, Martin wanted lists. What you are calling for is a 
cartesian product constructor of the form.

PFCartesian(k: Integer): with {
     coerce: ((n: Integer) -> PF(n)) -> %;
     ...
} == add {
     ...
}

Then instead of [f(100, n) for n in primes(1,k)] it would be more 
appropriate to define

k: Integer == << stdin; -- read from standard input and make it constant
foo(m: Integer)(n: Integer): PF(n) == m :: PF(n);
import from PFCartesian(k);
z := foo(42) :: PFCartesian(k);

Such a construction would work, but it does not involve a Generator or 
something that you must compute at compile time.

Quick remark --  it has been shown that:
1) C++'s template language is a Turing Complete PL
2) Haskell's class types (with common extensions) is also a Turing 
Complete PL
3) All meta-programming systems allow arbitrary compile time evaluation

Yes, it does make debugging harder.  But the advantages seem to _far_ 
outweigh the problems.  One just develops new debugging (and coding) 
techniques to deal with the added power/complexity.

I could re-use Stephen's brilliant closing line from yesterday's email:
    "These kinds of errors have to be seen as bugs in programs, just as 
division by zero is a programming error and not an invalidation of 
integer arithmetic." -- S.M. Watt
[where 'These kinds of errors' is now /Programs with infinite loops in 
types/]

THe reported error should only occur using the Debian way of building
aciom. 

I believe the first problem you will encounter with the ansi image is
that ansi triggers an error if an (in-package ...) is encountered
before the corresponding (make-package ...), whereas the older
standard implied the latter with the former.  There is some file
earlier in your log which failed to compile is my guess.
Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to get all exits in the error
handler to return non-zero to the shell to abort the build immediately
at sign of trouble.

Do you want to use the ansi image?  GCL has kept the older one around
specifically for reasons like this.  Unless you are using oop, all you
get is extra unused image size.

Take care,

This is not quite right -- the ansi build will trigger errors in
several places allowed to pass in the traditional image.

This is read by the wrapper script in the Debian gcl package.  People
building from source by hand just get one image, the Debian package
builds four and allows the user to select at runtime with these env
variables.

We can step over the in-package error, but Paul Dietz' 'definitive'
ansi test suite demands an error here, so I think this will break
compliance.

Not sure what I was thinking here.

Yes, please note that these are no longer constrained to a power of 2,
but we still have a little work to support 32bit heaps ober 2Gb.

OK, but shouldn't we follow the C semantics and cause an error unless
an explicit delete was issued before a rename?  

I don't know what lisp is supposed to do on collisions here - perhaps
you guys might check clisp or comp.lang.lisp:


20.2.7 rename-file                                                      [Function]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`rename-file'  filespec new-name =>  defaulted-new-name, old-truename,
new-truename

Arguments and Values::
......................

filespec--a pathname designator.

   new-name--a pathname designator other than a stream.

   defaulted-new-name--a pathname

   old-truename--a physical pathname.

   new-truename--a physical pathname.

Description::
.............

rename-file modifies the file system in such a way that the file
indicated by filespec is renamed to defaulted-new-name.

   It is an error to specify a filename containing a wild component,
for filespec to contain a nil component where the file system does not
permit a nil component, or for the result of defaulting missing
components of new-name from filespec to contain a nil component where
the file system does not permit a nil component.

   If new-name is a logical pathname, rename-file returns a logical
pathname as its primary value.

   rename-file returns three values if successful.  The primary value,
defaulted-new-name, is the resulting name which is composed of new-name
with any missing components filled in by performing a merge-pathnames
operation using filespec as the defaults.  The secondary value,
old-truename, is the truename of the file before it was renamed.  The
tertiary value, new-truename, is the truename of the file after it was
renamed.

   If the filespec designator is an open stream, then the stream itself
and the file associated with it are affected (if the file system
permits).

Examples::
..........

     ;; An example involving logical pathnames.
      (with-open-file (stream "sys:chemistry;lead.text"
                              :direction :output :if-exists :error)
        (princ "eureka" stream)
        (values (pathname stream) (truename stream)))
     =>  #P"SYS:CHEMISTRY;LEAD.TEXT.NEWEST", #P"Q:>sys>chem>lead.text.1"
      (rename-file "sys:chemistry;lead.text" "gold.text")
     =>  #P"SYS:CHEMISTRY;GOLD.TEXT.NEWEST",
        #P"Q:>sys>chem>lead.text.1",
        #P"Q:>sys>chem>gold.text.1"

Exceptional Situations::
........................

If the renaming operation is not successful, an error of type
file-error is signaled.

   An error of type file-error might be signaled if filespec is wild.

My tests of re-compiling a SPAD function still failed. :-(

Unfortunately my patch to rename_file is not sufficient for Axiom.
Axiom really does seem to expect that rename is as destructive
as the 'mv' shell command. But the semantics of 'rename' is
different:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Renaming-Files.html

int rename (const char *oldname, const char *newname)

"If oldname is a directory, then either newname must not exist
or it must name a directory that is empty. In the latter case,
the existing directory named newname is deleted first."

It seems that to simulate the behaviour of 'mv' with the Gnu C
library one must write a simple recursive routine to hit all of
the files and subdirectories of a given directory, etc. etc.

---------------

But wait a minute! Does hacking away at GCL really make any
sense? Let's take a look at exactly what Axiom is doing with
this ... dig dig dig ... Aha:

    src/interp/nlib.lisp.pamphlet

Ok, here is the offensive coding in Axiom!

---------

;; ($ERASE filearg) -> 0 if succeeds else 1
(defun $erase (&rest filearg)
  (setq filearg (make-full-namestring filearg))
  (if (probe-file filearg)
#+:CCL (delete-file filearg)
#+:AKCL
      (if (library-file filearg)
          (delete-directory filearg)
          (delete-file filearg))
      1))

(defun library-file (filename)
; (format t "library-file: ~a~%" filename)
 t)


#+:AKCL
(defun delete-directory (dirname)
   (system (concat "rm  -r " dirname)))

(defun $REPLACE (filespec1 filespec2)
    ($erase (setq filespec1 (make-full-namestring filespec1)))
    (rename-file (make-full-namestring filespec2) filespec1))

----------------

Elsewhere Axiom calls $REPLACE to replace xxx.NRLIB with the
contents of xxx.erlib. This used to work. What has changed?

The only thing I see here that I know has changed around about
gcl-2.6.7pre is 'probe-file'. The change was the 'probe-file'
returning nil for directories.

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-05/msg00283.ht
ml

Yes, indeed! So now Axiom only deleted files but not directories!
It used to do both. I think what it wants to know is whether
the file or directory exists.

I should have remembered this:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-02/msg00219.ht
ml
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-09/msg00045.ht
ml

Although the lisp spec is a horrible mish-mash, as near as I
can figure it

 (directory (truename filearg))

will test of a particular file or *directory* exists, although it
seems to do some kind of "wild card" since it also finds files
or directories that have something after a dot (.). So

 (directory (truename "xxx"))

returns a list of all files or directories of the form "xxx.*"
Contrary to the documentation at

http://www.cs.queensu.ca/software_docs/gnudev/gcl-ansi/gcl_1138.html#SEC
1138

Yuck!

Anyway it seems the following patch replacing (probe-file filearg)
with (directory (truename filearg)) should work (for Axiom's purposes
at least):

----------

;; ($ERASE filearg) -> 0 if succeeds else 1
(defun $erase (&rest filearg)
  (setq filearg (make-full-namestring filearg))
  (if (directory (truename filearg))
#+:CCL (delete-file filearg)
#+:AKCL
      (if (library-file filearg)
          (delete-directory filearg)
          (delete-file filearg))
      1))

----------

Any comments? Does anyone see how to do this a better way?

Regards,
Bill Page.

But well-typed programs can still diverge!  So "go wrong" just means 
that _when_ they return a value, it is guaranteed to be of the right type.

You can do the same thing for types - this is usually called a 'kinding' 
system.  In fact some languages (like Tim Sheard's Omega -- 
http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/Omega/index.html) push that further by 
having a complete hierarchy (the names often used for the lower levels 
are term - type - kind - sort).

A "well-kinded" type doesn't "go wrong" either [assuming termination].

No dispute there.

With Type:Type, it is not clear to me that when a well-typed
expression does not diverge, its value is not "wrong".

Yes, I think you are correct. However the log does not show any
prior error message.

>=20

Yes, I still think it is a good idea to make Axiom build under
the ansi version of gcl in spite of the fact that in it's
currrent form it will not be taking advantage of the extra image
size. Standardizing the lisp dialect used in Axiom could have
some long term benefits, e.g. attract some new developers? and
make it easier to integrate standard lisp packages. (Of course
you know the "sales pitch"... :)

Anyway, I was quite pleased by how far the Axiom build got before
dying of ansi fever. Perhaps this confirms that there is not
much to be done to make the Axiom sources at least as gcl-ansi
compliant as Maxima.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Given the Axiom CMU port that was done, I think we can probably do this
in a reasonable amount of time as long as we just patch it enough to
get it working.  Re-factoring it to make it into clean, sensible ANSI
code is probably another story... however, we can do it incrementally
once we can run on an ANSI lisp in the first place.  As appealing as a
from the ground up re-write is, I think a gradual re-factor is more
realistic and a lot less up front work, for some significant gains.

I took a stab at SBCL once, and I have a feeling it will be the most
challenging of the ANSI lisps (it has a reputation as a stickler). 
However, since SBCL is also being (gradually) ported to Windows it
becomes a more attractive target.  A couple of hard things like threads
aren't there yet, IIRC, but I doubt Axiom would immediately need those
anyway.

The CMU work doesn't seem to quite work on current cmucl versions, so
there is probably some more cleanup to do even starting from those
changes as a foundation, but if we get serious about it I think it is
quite doable.

Should we draw the line in the sand and focus on that?  

Cheers,
CY

>=20

Absolutely! Here's a recipe:

  1) svn co
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements \
                axiom.build-improvements

  2) edit Makefile.pamphlet in three places

     GCLOPTS =3D --enable-ansi ...=20

  3) modify any in-package commands that don't comply or anything else
     obvious

  4) make clean

  5) ./configure --without-gcl

  6) make | tee build.log

  7) find out why the build stopped and repeat steps 3 to 6,
     shake and bake until done.

  8) svn diff > ansi.patches

  9) send the result to Gaby :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

One main difference between list of mathematical objects 
and say C++ objects is that the former is often 
homogeneous (elements of the list are of the same type) 
but the latter is often heterogeneous (elements need not 
be of the same type). In Axiom, all lists are homogeneous 
(even List Any) by definition of the domain List (or the 
domain Tuple). A variant that allows hetergeneous objects 
in a "list" is the domain Record. The bracket constructor 
is by default the list constructor but can be used to 
construct elements of Record. But since Record must have 
pre-defined named fields, Martin's line could not have 
meant a Record element. It certainly is not a list in the 
Axiom sense. So the remaining possibility is an element of 
a cartesian product. Axiom currently has a constructor for 
cartesian product of two sets: Product, where elements are 
constructed using the function makeprod. But here, we are 
not discussing existing domains, but rather whether 
Martin's expression is mathematically meaningful and 
whether the language allows its construction in Aldor. 

Getting back to your question, it is up to the programmer 
to define the bracket function for the domain where 
Martin's expression lives. Even though it may not be 
possible in Axiom to directly program tuples of 
heterogeneous domains, such tuples are present in most 
function signatures like foo:(INT, Boolean)->INT. I would 
expect Aldor therefore to be able to directly program 
tuples of heterogeneous domains. Thus Martin's expression, 
perhaps using round parentheses instead of brackets, 
should work in Aldor.

I don't know how "primes" is implemented but it is 
probably a built-in using both a table for lower range and 
some sophisticated algorithms for higher ones. I am not 
suggesting compile time evaluation be extended to all 
static computations, but my guess is "primes" is special. 
A bit of compiler optimization would probably evaluate 
expressions like 2+3, so why not primes(1,100)? Obviously, 
compile time evaluation should be severely restricted 
(otherwise many programs may compile to just the output if 
no input is required).

The main reason why it is not working presently is because 
we have not constructed cartesian product over an 
arbitrary set of domains. But nothing in the language 
(even Spad) seems to prevent one from doing this.

You meant: [f(100,2), f(100,3), f(100,5)], I assume.

As discussed above, what is missing is cartesian product 
over an arbitrary set of domains. If domains are first 
class objects, we should be able to construct sets of 
them, even via Generator, and hence also cartesian 
product. At the very least, one should be able to form a 
set or list of domains of the same category (which IS 
homogeneous). Something like:

Product(A: List PrimeField, B: List) 

where B is the index "set." Or, as you did below, using an 
anonymous function as the argument.

I am not following. Is PFCartesian(k) a cartesian product 
of the first k prime fields, like PFCartesian(3) is PF(2) 
x PF(3) x PF(5)? Then given a function (n:Integer)->PF(n) 
(basically, an sequence of elements, one from each PF(n), 
and n better be a prime! but let's pretend we interpret 
PF(n) as Integer mod n), the coerce function maps the 
anonymous function to PFCartesian(k) by using the first k 
elements in the sequence?

The construction of the domain PFcartesian(k) might, even 
when k is given at instantiation time, depending on the 
meaning of that domain.

As you know Record and Cross are two ways in Aldor to construct
heterogeneous tuples. The problem is that both must have a certain fixed
length when you write them into your program.

> brackets, should work in Aldor.

Martin's line contained a "for n in primes(1,100)" iterator, so the type
would only be know if the compiler were able to evaluate "primes(1,100)"
at compile time.

Whatever "built-in" means for you. It is certainly not built into the 
Aldor language, it is part of a library and as such it could mean 
anything I like.

To what should 2+3 evaluate? To the Integer 5? To the MachineInteger 5? 
To a sparse univariate polynomial 5? To 0 mod 5? It is awfully ambiguous 
and would in general involve more than just a call to the addition of 
machine size integers. I could have even overloaded + for 
MachineInteger. I guess, optimizing 2+3 to 5 is not even correct in some 
circumstances.

Of course not, but note that you have a generator in the above 
construction and thus the compiler does not know the length of the tuple 
until it is *computed*. To make myself clear: I believe that one can 
write a constuctor for arbitrary tuples of variable length, but Martin's 
syntax to construct an element of such a type would not work. (Please 
convince me otherwise by providing running code.)

Of course.

Oh, yes, of course it is possible (even now) to construct a 
heterogeneous tuple type via Generator. But Martin's construction would 
mean to construct the type AND the element at the same time. And that (I 
believe) is impossible.

No problem in Aldor.

#include "aldor"
U: List PrimitiveType := [Integer, String, Character];

That is a completely valid Aldor program.

I was not thinking too much about it. I wanted that PFCartesian(7) 
stands for PF(2) x PF(3) x PF(5) x PF(7) and PF for PrimeField. And the 
coerce function basically turns the projection functions into an element 
of PFCartesian.

As representation I could choose

Rep == (n: Integer) -> PF(n);

But I still cannot make

[f(100, n) for n in [2,3,5]$List(Integer)]

into valid Aldor code if f is the function given by Martin.

Can you?

Ralf

I have compiled and tested Axiom Silver build.improvements branch
with the new version of gcl-2.6.8pre, the above change as well as
the patch suggested by Camm:

As expected the problem with rename is solved by these changes.
Also Axiom has been built with 50% more memory (196*256) then was
possible with the previous version of gcl. This should eliminate
the memory related errors we have been seeing on some pages on
the Axiom Wiki. I have made this new version of Axiom the current
version on MathAction so that we can test it more thoroughly.

However I remain a little uncertain if 'directory' is really the
proper way to check for the existence of a file or directory in
common lisp?

Regards,
Bill Page.

What does "fixed" mean in this context?

>From our earlier discusion of 'random()' in the context of
Aldor types that are determined at compile-time, it seems
clear that it should be no problem to define a constant such
as

  P:List Integer =3D=3D primes(1,100);

In fact, 'primes(1,100)' is a constant expression. As we
discovered, although P is a constant it's actual *value* is
only determined during run-time initialization, and then it
is fixed for the duration of the program execution. I recall
that you demonstrated in several programs that types in Aldor
(which must be constant) are also evaluated in exactly this
way.

At first I found this very surprising but now I am pretty
happy about it. :) That this is the case should not really
be so surprising considering that one of the target runtime
environments for Aldor is lisp!

Anyway I see no reason in principle for Aldor to reject
something like:

  [f(100,n) for n in P]::Cross(PF(n) for n in P)

where the bracket function is define by the Cross domain
constructor.

This is not the only type which satisfies Martin's original
example. Another possibility is:

  [f(100,n) for n in P]::List Union(n:PF(n) for n in P)

i.e. a List over a type union. This would be a more general
type than the cross product, but equally valid from a
conceptual point of view.

I am afraid that there may indeed be such a restriction --
at least in SPAD. The problem is how and when the arity of
functions is decided. The arity is actually encoded into
the names given to the functions and as far as I know these
names *must* be decided strictly at compile-time.

The situation in Aldor might be different but I do not
understand in sufficient detail the actual FOAM that Aldor
generates.

Although the length is not known at compile-time, nontheless
it is fixed at run-time initialization. That is not an
unusual sitation in Aldor.

Probably what we need is some kind of recursive type constructor.
See for example:

http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/Atypical/AldorExs/vector.as

Something like ... ?

PFCartesian(k: Integer): Type=20
    =3D=3D if k<=3D1 then PF(1) else =
Record(fst:PF(k),rst:PFCartesian(k-1));

Axiom Library Compiler Users Guide, 1994:

I hope to have more time some to work with these examples.

If you write Cross(A1, A2, ..., Ak) in your program with k types 
A1,...,Ak then the the k must be a natural number. Of course you can write

Cross(A1);
Cross(A1, A2);
Cross(A1, A2, A3);

but you cannot write

Cross [x for x in g]

for some Generator G and an appropriate definition of bracket.

Oh... maybe one can... but I am too lazy to check that you can write a 
bracket: Generator Type -> Tuple Type
and hand the result to Cross.

Anyway it doesn't solve the problem of having to generate the value and 
the type at the same time.

Interesting. That looks good, but is terribly wrong. Why? Because
    for n in P
accesses P destructively. Depending on what is evaluated first, either 
the Cross is essentially Cross() or the bracket is []. What language 
specification tells you the compiler should produce? (And both would be 
wrong anyway.)

This is exactly what I meant by "fixed length" above.

Oh! Although it is done a bit different, you should take a look at the 
definition of RecursiveMultivariatePolynomial0. Do you have the sources 
of Aldor's LibAlgebra?

Oh, a definition of Tree... Not very exciting. We now have a way to 
construct a binary tree as a combinatorial species in aldor-combinat

svn co svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk

Look at the end of the file src/species.as.nw and you'll find the 
following definition for a tree...

BinaryTree(L: LabelType): CombinatorialSpecies L == {
         macro {
                 + == Plus;
                 * == Times;
                 1 == EmptySetSpecies;
                 X == SingletonSpecies;
                 B == BinaryTree;
         }
         (1 + X * B * B)(L) add;
}

But I have the suspicion that it is not the right code to construct 
heterogeneous products. Anyway, the interesting part in the BinaryTree 
definition is that at the same time of constructing the tree you get a 
function that generates all (labelled) trees of a given size and a 
function that counts trees of a given size (the generating function).

If you look closer to that, then you see that vector.as is implementing 
"List" in a terribly complicated way.

Look at

-- Add up the entries of a Vector(n).
addVec(n:Integer,v:Vector(n)):Integer
     == {
     import from Record(fst:Integer,rst:Vector(n-1));
     if n<=1
           then 0
	  else vec.fst + addVec(n-1,vec.rst);
	  where { vec == (v pretend				-- A
	  		 Record(fst:Integer,rst:Vector(n-1))); }};

in particular look at the argument. If it were a list you could forget 
about the n, but here you have to give it. I am sure, nobody would ever 
use such code.

If you must have a union over Vectors of arbitrary lenght then a cleaner 
design would be to define vectors of lenght n and in a second step 
define operations on vectors of different length.

In aldor-combinat you would define that thing like in the BinaryTree 
example I gave before but just use the equation V = 1 + X * V.
And, by the way, I did not use "pretend" in my code.

Dear Bill:

Is there any info that is still useful on
http://page.axiom-developer.org?
Can some of these pages be deleted (or made unreadable by the public)?
It becomes very confusing to new users with so many info pages from the
past. Below are some sample wanderings:

I went and logged into http://portal.axiom-developer.org and click on
the Download button on the left. It said "Binary images and source
files", but "There are currently no items in the folder."

>From there, I selected the Home page. I don't think the posts after the
"add comment" button should belong there. The first post is "I try again
..." is dated 2004-09-02. While users should be allowed to post
comments, these should be monitored by everyone on the developer-list to
keep the info relevant.

When I viewed the download.html page (result after search on "axiom
download", the page seemed to be quite out of date). For example, it
says:
"The first release of Axiom is under development."

The page: http://portal.axiom-developer.org/wiki/AxiomWiki Main page,
which is: http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/wiki/AxiomWiki, is
2 years old. 

Just a random comment from random browsing. Your work on the site is
always appreciated.

William

Bad news... As I said previously axiom patch 50 does not compile under
Debian testing (and Debian unstable) . The error is:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
45 making /usr/local/axiom/src/graph
make[3]: entrant dans le r=E9pertoire =AB /usr/local/axiom/src/graph =BB
1 making /usr/local/axiom/src/graph/viewman
make[4]: entrant dans le r=E9pertoire =AB /usr/local/axiom/src/graph/view=
man
=BB
1 linking /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/lib/viewman
gcc: /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a: Aucun fichier ou r=E9pertoire de ce type
------------------------------------------------------------------------

where "Aucun fichier ou r=E9pertoire de ce type" means "not such file or
directory".=20

In Debian (testing/unstable) libXpm.a is in /usr/lib/ so the variable
XLIB is wrong (XLIB=3D/usr/X11R6/lib). Modifying the XLIB variable
corrects the problem (or eventually linking against the shared library).

Hello Bill,

I wanted to add "If you want to use the aldor compiler see [Aldor For
Axiom]." at the end of the 'Building Axiom on Linux' paragraph (page :
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom) without success, it asked me
a password that I do not have (even if I give a reason).  

I'm sure you can add that :)

Greg

I don't know. I have modified the XLIB variable (Debian testing) in
Makefile.pamphlet. Debian stable uses X11R6/lib directory I believe.

This is what the 'fedora5' stanza does automatically.
You get this stanza with

export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/fedora5

Yes, sorry. The reason your change was rejected is because of the
large number of bare http://... links on that page. The number of
such links is restricted becase of spam. But you can still use the
format "xxxx":http://...

I have added the text you wanted and I have also changed the links
to the new format so if you wish you can now edit it without a
password.

Thanks! :)

Bill.

No, I don't think so. This was my original "personal home page"
on the axiom-developer site. In addition to the wiki and the
portal, anyone who has an account directly on the axiom-developer
server also has such a web page. These are only editable when
you are directly logged in to the server.

Yes. Should I delete it, have it automatically re-direct to
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org or maybe take the time to
actually make it more "personal"? What do yo think?

See also for example Tim's personal page at:

http://daly.axiom-developer.org

Of course anyone who wishes to could also construct such a
"personal page" on the Axiom wiki or Axiom portal sites without
any special access to the server.

Agreed.

Thanks for reviewing this.

I am glad it is useful. I would be very pleased if you or anyone
else who has some time would go ahead with any changes that you
think would improve the site. The portal site in some cases changes
might require an upgrade of your registration "site manager" status
to allow edit access but I would be very pleased to delegate this
to who ever is motivated. :-)

If you don't have time, I will try to get to updating the portal
pages asap.

Regards,
Bill Page.
