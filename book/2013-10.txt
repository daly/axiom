Subject: About finite fields

I realized that when constructing finite fields providing a user choosen 
polynomial, Axiom doesn't check whether the used polynomial is 
irreducible or not.

For example:

(10) -> factor(x^8+x^4+x^2+x+1::PF 2)
(10) ->
            4    3       4    3    2
    (10)  (x  + x  + 1)(x  + x  + x  + x + 1)
                                Type: Factored(Polynomial(PrimeField(2)))
                                                              Time: 0 sec
(11) -> K:=FFP(PF 2,x^8+x^4+x^2+x+1)
(11) ->
    (11)  FiniteFieldExtensionByPolynomial(PrimeField(2),?^8+?^4+?^2+?+1)
                                                          Type: Domain
                                                Time: 0.01 (IN) = 0.01 sec
(12) -> size()$K
(12) ->
    (12)  256
                                                 Type: NonNegativeInteger
                                                              Time: 0 sec
(13) -> a:=index(2)$K
(13) ->
    (13)  %A
    Type: FiniteFieldExtensionByPolynomial(PrimeField(2),?^8+?^4+?^2+?+1)
                                               Time: 0.01 (OT) = 0.01 sec
(14) -> minimalPolynomial a
(14) ->
           8    4    2
    (14)  ?  + ?  + ?  + ? + 1
                          Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial(PrimeField(2))
                                                              Time: 0 sec
(15) -> (a^4+a^3+1)*(a^4+a^3+a^2+a+1)
(15) ->
    (15)  0
    Type: FiniteFieldExtensionByPolynomial(PrimeField(2),?^8+?^4+?^2+?+1)
                                                              Time: 0 sec


I am surprised that FiniteFieldByPolynomial allows a contruction which, 
clearly, has no sense and I am wondering if this has to be considered a 
bug to be fixed.

The problem with having Axiom "automatically" perform a irreducibility
check is that the check could be time consuming.=A0 Suppose you have a
polynomial of high degree whose factorization takes, say, a couple of
minutes.

With an automatic irreducibility test, AXIOM would factor the
polynomial every time you create the finite field, which is probably
not what you would want.

I didn't consider this aspect. You are right: it can be quite annoying
indeed.

If there is no way out from this, maybe it could be worth to stress in the
documentation this point and the fact tha the user _must_ take care of the
chosen polynomial.

That's true.

I haven't checked Axiom, but in FriCAS (I guess the documentation is
still identical to the one in Axiom) it says for
FiniteFieldExtensionByPolynomial:

  ... generated by the extension polynomial defpol which
  MUST be irreducible.

However, if the parameters given to a domain D are identical, then Axiom
should be smart enough to take the already created domain. In other
words if you have

  a: FiniteExtensionFieldByPolynomial(F, defpol) := something
  b: FiniteExtensionFieldByPolynomial(F, defpol) := something_else

then Axiom would create the extension domain only once.

OK, I haven't checked this, but this is the idea.

Of course there can be situations where
FiniteExtensionFieldByPolynomial(F, defpol) would be used in a
completely different context so that Axiom would have no chance to
realize that this domain has already been computed, then it would create
a second copy.

Best thing probably is to do

E := FiniteExtensionFieldByPolynomial(F, defpol)
a: E := ...
b: E := ...

Hi,
may you help me with this error?

I give these commands

RG:= DMP(vl,Q);
FRG:=FRAC(RG)

and i get this error

These commands work if the length of vl is at most 8 but i don't know 
why and where the problem is.

and it doesn't fail here. There is a join function used in Axiom which
has the potential to exceed the lisp limit for argument lists if the
join function is compiled. However, it works fine interpreted. As a 
result the join function is never compiled in Axiom. It looks like you
managed to compile that function somehow.

By default Axiom runs a significant portion of its test suite during
build. There are tests in the suite which are known to fail and are
open bugs. This is not a sign of a problem that should affect you.

Axiom runs about 150,000 tests during build. There are another
125,000 long running tests normally skipped. You can skip all
testing by doing:

    make TESTSET=3Dnotests

If you do run the tests this is an example of what you are likely to see:

Perhaps you can download the source from axiom-developer.org
and do a fresh build. All you need to do is:

git clone git://github.com/daly/axiom.git
cd axiom
export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

Let me know if this fails.

Subject: Windows

Greetings!  Are there instructions to build just the lisp/axiom stuff,
and skip any of 1) the docs 2) clef 3) sman 4) bsd/X11 specific c code? 

I'm testing gcl 2.6.10 pre-release, and have resolved a long standing
issue on windows.  maxima and acl2 now go through natively using the
latest mingw/gcc tools.   Was hoping to test axiom as well.  The website
prescription of downloading portabile ubuntu will obviously work, but
won't stress test the windows binary compiler/loader in gcl.

I've installed texlive, and get to bsdsignal.c before crashing (which it
of course must do).

If I recall a previous command line via the up arrow and then I edit it, 
the line will usually be messed up.

If I start axiom with -nox it works fine but I will lose the tab 
completion.

Is there a way to have both features or do I need to choose which one is 
more useful to me?

Thanks

Fabio
