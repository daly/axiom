In fact, I haven't been able to reproduce it myself. While doing a fresh
recompilation to have compilation log, this time compilation completed
without any error. As I also have your axiom package on my debian
machine, I have probably messed up $PATH or $AXIOM variables. Sorry for
the false alarm.

You can try with another one: David Mentre.

BTW, I also have bounces from your email. It seems that wanadoo.fr (my
ISP) don't want to talk to yours. :(

As I said, my issue seems to have vanished in /dev/null. Anyway, if this
issue reappears, you'll be the first to be informed. :)

Hello,

After a checking on my own side (did you said paranoid? :), I have
closed bug #5059 (Axiom does not compile with upshifted characters in
path). Tim has applyied Juergen patch. This opens the door to Mandrake,

Subject: Re: [Gcl-devel] Mandrake

Greetings!  This is either a sed or more likely an emacs problem.  An
emacs must be installed for gcl configure currently.  In general, the
build-dependencies for GCL are listed in the head of the file
debian/control -- installing these should make these problems go away,
I'd wager.

We can and should rework the configure not to require emacs, IMHO.  In
fact, we may already have, if the user supplies --enable-emacsdir,
though I haven't tested this.

Please let me know if problems persist.

Take care,

Subject: Patch for clef & detailed procedure to make it using GNU Arch

Hello Tim,

As requested, here is the patch to make clef work as an Arch
changeset. Please find below how I made it. I hope it is clear. If you
have questions, do not hesitate to ask.


BTW, I have made a mirror of my own Arch archive on the web:

 David Mentre--2004-code  http://www.linux-france.org/~dmentre/arch-ive/

The below changeset is available in this archive (as "axiom--clef--1").
So, if you want, you can try to get my patch from there and try to play
with "tla star-merge".



In below explanation, following prefixes are used:
 ###: for my comments

 $: shell commands I typed

 [ ]: my comments on tla output or things to do

 the rest: tla output

Tim, if you want to have a look at the content of the changeset I sent
you, you can type following command after unzipping-untaring it:

$ tla show-changeset --diffs axiom--clef--1--patch-1.patches


The tla command apply-changeset (alias dopatch) should probably be used

I applied the patch and I'm going to try the same patch cycle as you did

Greetings!  Am just wondering why this is necessary.  I have to save
*system-directory* before running makeint.lisp and restore it
afterwards to enable the build to complete on architectures currently
without save-system (ia64 mips alpha hppa), as GCL uses
*system-directory* to find its include file cmpinclude.h when
necessary.

I believe that Axiom uses it to find external functions it runs.

Currently there are no external functions.

The unterminated 's' command in config.status is not related to emacs.

rebuilt GCL with the same result as before. Do you have a particular

Subject: [Q&A][2004-02-04] Current bug status

Hello,

We have currently 30[1] open bugs. Here is the list of them with some
comments. I tried to sort them by severity, so that we could do our
stable release as fast as possible.

I'm new to this "job", so do not hesitate to criticize, add new bugs or
add any things I have overlooked.

And last but not least, each one of us should try to fix them. There is
no magic silver bullet to fix bugs. :)


I have used following severity levels:
 9 - Blocker: a show stopper bug. Must be fixed for our next stable
              release (i.e. release critical)
 5 - Average: An annoying bug that should be fixed
 3 - Ordinary & 1 - None: feature wish and other low priority
                          items. More a reminder than a bug.


Item ID  Severity  	Status  	Summary
=======  ========       ======          =======

7585 	9 - Blocker 	Open 	The current free Axiom has no complete documentation 
5906 	5 - Average 	Open 	TeX display of long variable names is broken 
  Just a bad display. Reduce it at severity 3?

4551 	5 - Average 	Open 	duplicate functions exists. optimizer complains during rebuild 
  As far as I know, it does not impact Axiom compilation and
  working. Reduce severity to 3?

4552 	5 - Average 	Open 	protect* functions should be #:NAG only

4562 	5 - Average 	Open 	axiom option -rv no longer works 

4564 	5 - Average 	Open 	Axiom access to OpenMath library no longer works 
  Apparently, this is a show stopper for at least one of our potential
  user. 

4582 	5 - Average 	Open 	Semantic Errors when building algebra 
  I don't know if those are just warnings or real errors.

4583 	5 - Average 	Open 	French error message when building SPLTREE 
  Is it a real error or just a funny message?

5786 	5 - Average 	Open 	TeX output broken on factor(15) 
  Once again, a display error. Reduce severity to 3?

6357 	5 - Average 	Open 	sqrt(-1/abs(x))-1/sqrt(-abs(x))=>0 

6490 	5 - Average 	Open 	when is broken 
  Should I move this one to severity 9?

6863 	5 - Average 	Open 	The normal distribution should be numerically invertable 

7376 	5 - Average 	Open 	integrate fails 
  This one is fixed. -1.

7527 	5 - Average 	Open 	Clef does not work

6093 	5 - Average 	Open 	Missing tex-tags in axiom.sty 

4580 	5 - Average 	Fix proposed 	With safety 3 activated, axiom does not compile

  wonder if some bugs are not lying in the underlying lisp.

4733 	5 - Average 	Fix proposed 	Floating point error round(-3.77623) etc. 
  A real issue. Should I increase to severity 9?

5379 	5 - Average 	Fix proposed 	Missing algebra (was: package CombinatorialFunction (COMBF) is missing) 
  Is it release critical? I don't think so.

5743 	5 - Average 	Fix proposed 	Makefile issues: INTERP.EXPOSED is remade every time & typos in the algebra/Makefile 
  Wasn't this one fixed?

4553 	3 - Ordinary 	Open 	one? function calls need to be restored

Well it took a while to figure out but I succeeded.
The change you made to Makefile.linux doesn't need to be

will be automatically regenerated (since it is old) and the newly
generated Makefile.linux will already have your fix applied.
In fact the correct change is to delete the Makefile.linux file.

Hi Julien,

Sorry for the delay in replying.

I have implemented and certified a book about polynomials. In this book, you 
can find addition and multiplication of  two polynomials, and negation of a 
polynomial. The fundamental properties have been verified with ACL2. However, 
it does not include division of polynomials.

I presented a paper about this, "Automatic Verification of Polynomial Rings 
Fundamental Properties in ACL2", in ACL2 Workshop 2000.

This paper presents a formalization of multivariate polynomials over a 
coefficient field (initially, Q) along with the verification of its ring 
properties. Later, I formalized multivariate polynomials over an arbitrary 
(abstract) ring.

However, an inconvenient is that this particular formalization is not 
efficient. In fact,  I have the intention of improving it.

Subject: gnu-arch and branches

I'm experimenting with gnu-arch branches and I believe I understand
the process now. There currently is a main line of code called
axiom--release--1 and one branch called axiom--book--1.

The basic idea is that you decide you want to work on some 
subproject (say, the book or the graphics). There will be
a branch for that subproject. All changes are made on that
branch. These branch changes will NOT appear in the main
branch.

Anyone can grab and modify any branch, commit the changes
to that branch, and then go work on something else.

Once I get this all worked out I have a dozen or so branches
to create. If you want your own branch I can create one for
you. When a branch is sufficiently mature it will get merged
into the main branch. I'll produce a document describing
the purpose of each branch that I create.

The main branch will (after testing) be copied on the main
axiom website in the savannah CVS system.

The purpose of this exercise is twofold: first to try to figure 
out a way that all of us can pursue our own goals for axiom and
second to figure out a peer-to-peer development model rather
than a thin pipe thru me.

David, you have your own website and we should try your
suggestion of "star" merging using the axiom--book--1
branch. 

The current axiom--book--1 branch contains the book source
(src/doc/book.pamphlet) in its latest form. This branch is
intended for all book-related changes.

If any of this is unclear to any of you feel free to ask 
questions. It took me a long time to work this stuff out
and I still have a few wrinkles to understand.

As the author of PLEQN (in Axiom), I am sorry to say that the package is not
suitable for any large system, even if it is sparse. Certain subroutines in that
package would need to be made more efficient to take care of the sparse
structure (not just sparseness). For example, if your system is sparse and
bilinear (that is the coefficients are linear in their variables), you may try a
heuristic algorithm. Fritz Schwartz has done something like that in his LODO
package (in Axiom, and perhaps also in Reduce), I believe. I think Thomas Wolf
also has some package (in Maple?). Clemens Ballarin has done some comparisons.

Mathematica also has a decent command Reduce that may work, but I do not know
what algorithm is used.

Subject: Axiom build issues

Greetings!  We're preparing for the gcl 2.6.2 stable release, which
will hopefully be the last stable for quite some time as we turn our
attention to the development branch.  Of course it is very important
for us to make sure this release is solid for axiom.  And its looking
quite good so far -- no apparent build problems (due to GCL) on any of
the Debian architectures (see

http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?pkg=axiom 

if interested).  There are a few small items I'd like to squeeze in,
the most important being to ensure that GCL exits with non-zero when
stdin is redirected from a file or pipe and a lisp error is triggered
-- this will stop the commands executed by make at that point.  And
there should be an option to quiet the banner.

Along these lines, I have a question about the regression tests.  It
would be nice if the output was compared to results known to be
correct, with the build bailing out otherwise.  Then one can be sure
by the mere fact that the build completes that the build is also
correct, (i.e. without having to wade through the output by hand).  Is
something like this already in place or possible?

There are a few other items in the Debian package build which are not
GCL related per se.  One is that the build will timeout on slow
machines when compiling expexpand.spad.  As was noted before, there
appears to be an inordinate amount of mysterious bignum garbage, or at
least relocatable garbage, being generated here which could be tracked
down at some point.  For the time being I've put in a hack to echo a
string every 15min in the background for some period while the make is
running.  Another alternative would be to turn on si::*notify-gbc*,
but this would enlarge an already copious output.

Then there is the question of the outstanding patch we're using in
Debian now 1) to use an external GCL, and 2) to use compiler::link to
build the image on machines which cannot do native relocations (alpha
ia64 mips(el) hppa).  Its fine the way it is, but I'm wondering if at
some point we can put in an alternate build target in the Makefiles
supporting these build commands in axiom per se.  I'd be happy to
maintain them if/when we decide on a rule structure.  The sequence
right now works without issue, but GCL could make this more
transparent on these platforms eventually.  Improvements in this area
should however be put off to the next stable release which will likely
be quite some time in the future.

On a totally different topic, has anyone written an emacs mode for
axiom?  I tried out the texmacs interface with the Debian package and
its broken.  There is a simple isse regarding paths and executable
names that I can workout with the texmacs maintainer.  But this aside,
one still gets garbage using the mode, at least for me.

1) Most of it is standard LaTeX.
2) Do not use TeX-oddities like \over and \atop.
3) Do not perform manual line-breaking.
4) Use \* for multiplication and \big. as a delimiter in
   \sum_{i=1}^n i \big.

For the rest, just try, and let me know if you have a problem.

Cc: Frederic Lehobey

yes, SPADEDIT is broken.
The issue is that catdef.spad is expanded into its component parts
during the compile process. 

Thus, during system make:

  catdef.spad.pamphlet -> BASTYPE.spad (and other component categories)
  
The compiler puts the name of the source (BASTYPE.spad) into the 
NRLIB of the file it is compiling.

The database build process collects these NRLIB entries.

The )show command uses these entries for the output line:

  Issue )edit /usr/lib/axiom-0.20040128/../../src/algebra/BASTYPE.spad to 
  see algebra source code for BASTYPE 

The problem is that the name of the originating pamphlet file is not
preserved anywhere. The fix might be to have the pamphlet expansion
process put a line like:

)origin catdef.spad.pamphlet

in the generated BASTYPE.spad file and then have the compiler use
that name in the NRLIB.

I'll put it on the todo list.

Actually it would be more useful if the banner were written to a lisp
variable. Then I could manipulate the string into the axiom banner in
a clean way.

There used to be a regression test run that compared the output.
There are some subtle issues but these are taken care of by that code.
In particular, you need to distinguish between bug that you didn't cause
and bugs you did (while testing boundary cases, etc). To do that you 
  )set msg test on
which is an historical switch I used for exactly this purpose. 
It will generate a "DALYBUG" message when an error occurs. If you
wrap your deliberately failing test by turning this switch on you
can tell that the bug is expected.

I'll put revival of this code on the todo list.

This is clearly a bug somewhere. If you can get a clue about what
routine it is running that would focus the search.

We could easily make this change. Look at the top level Makefile.pamphlet.
Each system can have its own Makefile generated. To get this working you


(a) copy the \subsection{Makefile.linux} in Makefile.pamphlet (line 813)
(b) create a \subsection{Makefile.debian} and rename linux to debian.
(c) set your AXIOM variable to:
      AXIOM=(yourpath)/axiom/mnt/debian
(d) type make

and you'll get a Makefile.debian built from your new <<Makefile.debian>>
chunk. You can change that chunk any way you like.

I'm unaware of an axiom emacs mode. Likely it would just be a clone of
an existing mode. Axiom used to have emacs tags automatically generated
so that you could walk among the axiom source files using keystrokes.
Tagging should come back and I believe there is lisp code in Axiom to
create the tags already.

I'll put revival of this code on the todo list.

I've set up axiom for development purposes using the gnu-arch system.
This allows multiple branches for development. If you want to experiment
with GCL related changes we can set up an axiom--gcl--1 branch for you.

Subject: Re: [Axiom-mail] TeX vs LaTeX output on AXIOM
Cc: Douglas Troeger, Gilbert Baumslag

Bill,

I've created a branch called axiom--crystal--1 which creates a new
subdirectory src/crystal. In that subdirectory is a file all.spad
which shows work I've been doing on the question you raised about
the algebra lattice.

In particular, all.spad was created as follows:

(1) all of the spad files were concatenated
       
   This creates the pile of existing code that needs to be considered.

(2) all documentation strings were removed

   We're only after the relationship of code to code so we don't need docs.

(3) all function implementation code was removed

   We're interested in the category and domain relationship so we don't 
   need to know how functions work.

(4) Each unique category and domain signature line is broken out and
    classified so it can be parsed. 

   This allows us to find the general and specific patterns that are
   used within the categories and domains. 

I'm currently working on step (4). This will allow us to write code
to automatically generate the lattice. From that code we can create
a lattice-based browser which is planned to be one of the many facets
of the crystal interface.


Crystal, in case I haven't mentioned it, is my attack on the 30-year
problem of merging the mathematics with the code. Literate programming
is just an initial step. We can clearly parse the code in a literate
program but we can't yet do anything with the mathematics. Crystal
is an effort to attack this.

The fundamental "mental picture" of the crystal idea has 2 parts.
 
Part 1 is like a huge knotted ball of string in space. This data
structure (now called a "Jenks graph" (named after Dick Jenks))
contains nodes and links. The nodes are data structures similar
to "concepts" in a semantic network or a knowledge-base system.
The links are also data-structures which contain relational 
semantics between the nodal concepts. I have code to support the
Jenks graph in common lisp but have not yet uploaded it as it is
still "in process". It will eventually show up in the src/crystal
directory and I'll let you know when it is there.

Part 2 is like a huge, hollow crystal that surrounds the Jenks graph.
The crystal is also a data structure (called a "Susan graph") which
contains "facets". Facets are ways of looking at a Jenks graph. The
easiest (albeit too shallow) way of thinking about a facet is that
you compute some information from the Jenks graph and pipe it into 
a display program (the facet) like a browser tab.

Tim, et al.

I think it would be great if we could get Axiom into
a state where it could be included on one of these
stand-alone Linux CD rom products. I think it might
lead to a lot of good exposure of Axiom to the "next
generation".

  http://www.nongnu.org/axiom
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom

Does anyone have an opinion about the best way to
approach this?

Can we set a target date to be ready for this? Say, at
the latest sometime before next September. Earlier?
How much needs to be done to get Axiom ready? I use
Axiom right now with TeXmacs with very few problems,
but of course it is not what I would call "turn-key".
But then neither are many of the other open source
packages that are included in the list of software
mentioned in the email below.

Chu-Ching and Others,

SciLix is a LiveCD for Universitary Teaching based on Morphix (a =

shares a lot of programs with the LiveCD that Chu-Ching its doing
(except Macaulay and the documents). Also it uses the XFCE light weigth

Ram and Hard Disk and less space utilization.

You can get more info about it in:

Hi all,

Axiom is already included in the pre-0.2 version of SciLix, but at the
release included has a bug when is called from TeXmacs. I get this
message:

(AXIOM Sockets) The AXIOM Server is undefined.

I'm apt-geting axiom righ now. I hope this version will solve the
integration problem with TeXmacs. I like a lot the Axiom project and the
idea about Literate Programming from TeXmacs, and the use of it as a
system for building axiom documentation. Have you considered the
Creative Commons License for that documentation? I can help with
translations.

The 0.2 release of SciLix will have the integration bug solved I hope,
and eventually the Axiom Manual integrated.

Cheers,

Offray

I'm the one who put the Debian axiom package together, and there still
appears to be issues with texmacs, at least as the latter is
distributed by Debian.  I'm not sure the Debian texmacs axiom
interface is the latest.  Unfortunately, I don't have time to chase
this down right now.

Wouldn't it be better if each of the CAS programs shipped their own
texmacs interface, maybe even dh_installtexmacs in Debian?

Take care,

This branch contains the current state of the graphics code.

Basically the graphics code should be runnable stand-alone using the viewman

Savannah is "released" code. That is, I've run it thru all of the building
and testing. This is where people who just want to use Axiom should get
their code.

Unfortunately I have a dozen or so paths of code under development some
of which will not yet even compile. I've been doing all of the development
work on these locally. That takes a long time and no-one can really share
in the effort.

In order to expose my current working state to the rest of the world on
different efforts I have set up a second archive on tenkan. This archive
has a main branch (axiom--release--1) which is code that will end up being
copied to savannah. It also has several secondary branches that are works
in progress. The current branches are:

  axiom--release--1    the pre-savannah testing version
  axiom--book--1       the axiom book branch
  axiom--cats--1       the CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite) branch
  axiom--crystal--1    the new Crystal browser branch
  axiom--graphics--1   the axiom graphics code

I'm adding branches as I separate my local pile into distinct efforts.
None of the code in each distinct branch is on savannah yet but the
intention is to merge it and put it there eventually (once it works).

I want to create a separate branch for your algebra code. I've purchased
a book on Quantum Field Theory (Kaku) which has a few strong chapters on
group theory, including Poincare and Lorentz groups. I'm trying to 
understand the algebra that underlies the physics work you're doing.
It seems clear that Lie algebras are an area we need to strengthen.

There are two things that would be useful. 

First is to post a bug report so that any things you find 
don't get lost. The bug reporting can be done on Savannah.

Second is that the book is now online and, if you're in the mood,
you can work out a corrected version of the example, download the
axiom--book--1 branch, fix it and send me the patches.

Greetings!  This is just a heads up that its looking good for a GCL
stable release by 2/29.  If you have any testing you want to do, now
is the time!

At least on Debian GNU/Linux, I can state that no GCL specific
problems are known in building and self-testing any of gcl,acl2,maxima
and axiom on all 11/12 supported platforms.  Likewise nqthm-1992 and
pc-nqthm-1992, the latter with an expanded value stack, also pass on
i386. 

We also have good reports from Windows/mingw, macosx, and freebsd,
though the latter are a bit old now.  Additional testing and reports
on these systems are most appreciated.  I will also endeavor to run
some tests on solaris.

The latest stable source can be retrieved from cvs via

export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSROOT=:ext:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcl
cvs -z9 -q co -r Version_2_6_1 -d gcl-2.6.1 gcl

Binaries and source (slightly older) in html form can be found at

Dear Tim,

	I have tried to install gnu-arch (tla), but the recent rpm's rely
on the glibc.2.3.2 and my SuSE 8.0 is using an older glibc. Since its
quite risky to change the glibc in a running system, I have to update to
SuSE 9.0 or to try to compile gnu-arch. Hence, would it be a geart problem
for you, to put the axiom book to the savannah server, since I don't have
any problems with cvs ;-)

My PC info: Red Hat-9.0

As "README" suggestion, I make the source in /mnt/sda7/LiveCAS/axiom/
, copy whole the directory, mnt/linux, to /usr/local/axiom and

export AXIOM=/usr/local/axiom
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
ln -s /usr/local/axiom/bin/axiom /usr/local/bin

Also compile and install TeXmacs-1.0.3.3 in /usr/local. But no option of
axiom
in the [Text]->[session]. So I change the code in tm_axiom.c, now the option

appears. I had searched from google about such info's but nothing found. So
I
use this method to solve it.

huang,

What do you mean "there is no axiom icon"? Were
did you obtain this icon? And how does the presence
of abscence of the icon affect TeXmacs?

'axiom' is the name of a script that starts other
processes besides the one that is needed for TeXmacs.
'AXIOMsys' is the name of the Axiom binary. This is
all that is needed for Axiom. This binary is provided
by both old commercial version and the open source
version of Axiom.

  http://www.nongnu.org/axiom/

The Axiom plug-in was recently changed to accomodate
the fact that earler versions of open axiom only had
AXIOMsys.

Perhaps your problem with "axiom icon" is caused
by something else?

Bill Page.

'axiom' is the name of a script that starts other
processes besides the one that is needed for TeXmacs.
'AXIOMsys' is the name of the Axiom binary. This is
all that is needed for Axiom. This binary is provided
by both old commercial version and the open source
version of Axiom.

  http://www.nongnu.org/axiom/

The Axiom plug-in was recently changed to accomodate
the fact that earler versions of open axiom only had
AXIOMsys.

Perhaps your problem with "axiom icon" is caused
by something else?

Bill,

Apparently the word was not 'icon' but refers to a menu entry in texmacs.

I believe the last agreed upon state was that AXIOMsys was called
directly because at the present time the 'axiom' shell script only
adds clef handling which Texmacs does not need.

Greetings!

In the Debian package, I supply a shell script wrapper in the default
path (/usr/bin) to setup the AXIOM and PATH environment variables
before calling AXIOMsys.  I tried to make the Debian package preserve
the file tree structure axiom generates (in e.g. mnt/linux) on build,
and to do this, one has to put this directory somewhere like
/usr/lib/axiom-$(VERSION), in which case AXIOMsys will never be in the
user's default path.  Hence the need of a wrapper in the path, unless
I'm missing something.  It would be good if this was standardized in
some manner.

Take care,

Can you back-port the axiom shell script you use in the axiom CVS?
Or send it to me and I'll merge it in.

Just out of curiousity why "/usr/lib"? I'd have expected "/usr/local"
(or /opt if we were to actually read the LSB spec :-) ).

Camm sees a need to execute the axiom shell script rather than
directly invoking AXIOMsys, the axiom binary. 

In the past I believe we moved away from using the shell script
because it invoked clef (the axiom readline). 

The compromise position seems to be to invoke the shell script
but do it with the -noclef option and that the shell script
be rewritten to handle this. Axiom used to have a -noclef option
and will have it again in the future.

(a) are there any objections?
(b) if there are no objections we need to:
   (1) merge Camm's axiom approach with the current clef version
   (2) add -noclef handline
   (3) modify the texmacs plugin to add -noclef

Comments?

Tim,

It seems to me that we should avoid changes that will
outdate TeXmacs as it is now being distributed. TeXmacs
looks for something called AXIOMsys (it could be the
AXIOMsys binary for Axiom or it could be a bash script
of the same but located somewhere else). If such a
script it necessary, it should still be called AXIOMsys.
We do not want to make changes that would require that
TeXmacs be changed again to accomodate a new/old naming
convention for Axiom.

The name AXIOMsys works "right out of the box" for the
old commercial version of Axiom that many people are
still running and except for the way Axiom is configured
on Debian, it works for the other new source linux
versions. It seems to me that it is the Debian distribution
that should change to be compatible with the others. If
(for reasons that still remain very unclear to me) the
directory structure on Debian must be changed from the
what has be distributed for Axiom so far, then the minimum
that would be required is the on Debian the name AXIOMsys
refer either via a link or by a simple script to the
real executable - where ever it has to be located. Surely
this is done all the time on Debian? No?

Running clef makes no sense when interfacing between
TeXmacs and Axiom. In fact using AXIOMsys is an
improvement for the commercial version of Axiom as
well sense that extra stuff is not hanging around
in memory somewhere between TeXmacs and Axiom.

So I still vote to keep it simple and just make sure
that on every Axiom installation (just like the old
commercial version) an AXIOMsys is in the path.

Well, I can tell that we're perhaps not quite square with the
following, but the idea is this section of the FHS:


/usr/lib : Libraries for programming and packages
Purpose

/usr/lib includes object files, libraries, and internal binaries that
are not intended to be executed directly by users or shell
scripts. [22]

Applications may use a single subdirectory under /usr/lib. If an
application uses a subdirectory, all architecture-dependent data
exclusively used by the application must be placed within that
subdirectory. [23]

/usr/lib is common Debian practice for arch-dependent modules and
binaries not customarily invoked directly by the user.  /opt certainly
also seems like a possibility, but I've yet to find a Debian package
using it.  Perhaps I can find time to investigate this further.

Source linux versions?  I'm just wondering if other Linux distros are
providing pre-compiled binaries, and if so what they are doing.

OK, its quite simple for me to add a link in /usr/bin called AXIOMsys
pointing to axiom.  Still seems one needs the script to setup the
environment.  We of course could call the script AXIOMsys, but while
traditional, this certainly seems counterintuitive for new users to
find/type at a prompt.  If there are no objections then I'll make sure
the Debian package does the former.

On Debian (as well as a few of the BSDs at least, I'm told), axiom is
being build with an external gcl.  This image often has readline
enabled.  readline is shutoff automatically on startup when GCL (and
any image built on top of it) detects that the running terminal is not
readline capable, or if the TERM environment variable is set to "dumb"
(as in EMACS shell buffers for example.)  This might work without
change under TeXmacs, but if not, one can initialize with

(si::readline-off)

That's perfectly OK, it is common practice in Debian in case an

This is ok but step 1. is not necessary. You can keep
tm_axiom.c as it is in the standard distribution. I think
it is simplier if you just do

  1. copy $spad/mnt/linux to /usr/local/axiom
  2. edit /etc/profile, add:
     export AXIOM=/usr/local/axiom
     export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

$spad/mnt/linux/bin/axiom is (or will be in the near
future) a script which does not do anything useful for
TeXmacs in the current version (provided you have set
the /etc/profile correctly). In the future this script
will probably also invoke other processes (such as clef
and graphics) which may interfere with or delay Axiom.
But they are very desirable if you run Axiom from the
command line.

Anyway, if it works for you now this all is not
really such a big deal. We can straighten it out
again later if necessary.

This material has not yet been moved back onto
Savannah.

Tim Daly is currently in the process of updating
the original Jenks and Sutor AXIOM book. As you
can see from his message below. It is available
in rough draft form from

  tla get axiom@tenkan.org--axiom/axiom--book--1

(GNUarch archive) but I am not sure whether it is
suitable yet for distribution on your CD rom.

Thank you for all your working on updating the

Savannah is "released" code. That is, I've run it thru all of the building
and testing. This is where people who just want to use Axiom should get
their code.

Unfortunately I have a dozen or so paths of code under development some
of which will not yet even compile. I've been doing all of the development
work on these locally. That takes a long time and no-one can really share
in the effort.

In order to expose my current working state to the rest of the world on
different efforts I have set up a second archive on tenkan. This archive
has a main branch (axiom--release--1) which is code that will end up being
copied to savannah. It also has several secondary branches that are works
in progress. The current branches are:

  axiom--release--1    the pre-savannah testing version
  axiom--book--1       the axiom book branch
  axiom--cats--1       the CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite) branch
  axiom--crystal--1    the new Crystal browser branch
  axiom--graphics--1   the axiom graphics code

I'm adding branches as I separate my local pile into distinct efforts.
None of the code in each distinct branch is on savannah yet but the
intention is to merge it and put it there eventually (once it works).

I want to create a separate branch for your algebra code. I've purchased
a book on Quantum Field Theory (Kaku) which has a few strong chapters on
group theory, including Poincare and Lorentz groups. I'm trying to 
understand the algebra that underlies the physics work you're doing.
It seems clear that Lie algebras are an area we need to strengthen.

There are two things that would be useful. 

First is to post a bug report so that any things you find 
don't get lost. The bug reporting can be done on Savannah.

Second is that the book is now online and, if you're in the mood,
you can work out a corrected version of the example, download the
axiom--book--1 branch, fix it and send me the patches.

huang,

The errors that you see are because the version of
Axiom that you are using is incomplete. Some of the
required algebra modules have not been compiled by
Axiom. I do not know the reason, however these missing
modules sound like an early version of Axiom that
first became available last Septerber 2003. At that
time the Axiom make file was still incomplete and
did not build all of the required algebra. This was
corrected in versions of Axiom that became available
at the Savannah development site some time around
November 2003. But then there was a hacker attack
on Savannah and that site become unavailable until
nearly January (?). So we had to make do with temporary
locations for the files. Perhaps you or the Debian
developer (Camm, can you verify this?) somehow
managed to get an older set of files.

These missing modules seriously impact Axiom's
ability to more than a few simple calculations.
I think you should resolve this problem before
distributing Axiom on the CD rom.

Bill Page.

his LiveTeXmacs-1.0.3.3.iso Knoppix CD rom project.
But checking through my email I can't confirm that.
In fact in one place he refers to using RedHat 9.0.
So clearly I am confused.

Does you Debian version execute huang's two simple
examples correctly? Then I will stand corrected. But
still it seems that he must have an older version
of the Axiom source.

Do you still have problems with compatibility between
TeXmacs and Axiom on the Debian platforms? (unrelated
question)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Subject: [TeXmacs] LiveTeXmacs-1.0.3.3 CDROM released


Hi Joris and TeXmacs users,

Before the Linux kernal changed to 2.6, A more compact
Knoppix-based Linux CDROM focus on TeXmacs and CAS is
released, about 701mb, (named LiveTeXmacs-1.0.3.3.iso, :-)).
It contains: 
TeXmacs-1.0.3.3, Octave, R , Maxima, graphviz , yacas,
pari, gnuplot, Eukleides, Dr.Geo, qcl, rlab, Macaulay 2 (M2),
Scilab, and some texmacs files ( in /usr/dems/TeXmacs)
about Calculus (not yet finished). The image file will
be downloaded from:

ftp://math.cgu.edu.tw/pub/KNOPPIX
ftp://diffusion.cgu.edu.tw/pub/KNOPPIX

And this is to your new-born angel!

huang,

The date 20031003 for Axiom source is too old.
You should obtain complete new sources by cvs from

  http://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=axiom

Good luck!

The Debian texmacs maintainer has beat me to it.  He has applied the
following patch to texmacs for Debian, which (I've just confirmed)
makes axiom thereunder work just fine:

I haven't yet released the new Debian axiom with the symlink and am
wondering if it is still advisable.

Cc: Chu-Ching Huang

Camm,

Arrrggggh!

They are just undoing the use of AXIOMsys that Joris agreed
to the last time he updated the tm_axiom source... <sigh>

Couldn't they have at least used /usr/bin/AXIOMsys ??

Is this standard Debian policy to put such absolute
names in products instead of update PATH or putting
a link in a standard place?  This seems wrong to me.

About: "I haven't yet released the new Debian axiom
with the symlink and am wondering if it is still
advisable."

In my opinion, yes it is still advisable and the TeXmacs
maintainer should return to the source as distributed
by Joris.

Bill Page.

Subject: Axiom

I'm Tim Daly, the lead developer on the Axiom project
(homepage: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom).

I'd like to explore ways that Axiom can cooperate with your group's
efforts. In particular I see that you've been doing some work with
OpenMath. Axiom, thru the work of Mike Dewar, has OpenMath support
and we'd like to re-enable the use of OpenMath. 

Is there any interest in the ICM group for a cooperative effort?

The Axiom book is coming along. The entire book can now be extracted
from src/doc/book.pamphlet and the resulting tex file will properly
completely (though not fullly correctly) tex.

I've worked on the whole book and proofread the first 200 pages of the
electronic copy of the book which correspond to the first 4 chapters
of the paper version.

The electronic version is different from the paper version and 
incorporates work by Martin Dunstan. Once the first completed
version is finished there are yet other changes to incorporate.

You can get the latest copy by using GNU-Arch (the tar gzip file
is in the zips directory of the latest Axiom CVS version).

Also of note is that I've exported yet another effort to the Arch
archive. I've been looking at the details of integrating Axiom and ACL2.
The branch is called axiom--acl2--1 and can be retrieved by:

0. tla my-default-archive axiom@tenkan.org--axiom
1. tla archive-setup axiom-acl2--1
2. tla get axiom-acl2--1
