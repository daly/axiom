Subject: Metadata for the uploaded Windows source/binary package.

Hi all.

The upload is complete, along with a copy of libgmp.dll and
gmp-static-mingw-4.1.tar.gz.

The source (both Axiom and embedded GCL) was updated from CVS HEAD
approximately last Saturday.  It includes the Axiom "mnt/windows" binaries
and all intermediate files + some build logs.

The alterations are largely Bill's original patch kindly supplied to me
earlier in the year; little extra was needed.

I have not yet gone over the changes to ensure that the source tree will
still work on other platforms - I know there are some loose ends yet to be
tidied up in the Makefiles and source.  Those changes should not be
difficult.

I substituted GCL CVS HEAD for GCL 2.6.5 and made appropriate changes to the
pamphlets.

I hand patched the GCL code rather than regenerating patches for the CVS
version.

(Suggestion: Perhaps GCL should have a new "quiet compiler" flag in the
compiler package and a configure option (--with-external-objects ?) to add
external objects to the link.  Each of these would ease the patch workload
in the Axiom build system.)

Camm, I chose CVS HEAD at the time as I was expecting to debug for months
rather than days and figured that it would be easier on a cleaner source
tree - I rewrote the PE-COFF linking in the HEAD branch specifically to
support my attempt to debug Axiom.  Profuse apologies for potentially
undermining your good intentions re the stable version of GCL - 2.6.5.

I used:

  - MinGW32 gcc 3.4.2 with latest libraries, binutils,

  - hosted by MSYS,

  - MikTeX - a free Win32 TeX/LaTeX package,

  - in the particular Axiom build I uploaded, a dynamic GMP library
(libgmp.dll) is needed, but you will be better off building with the static
GMP library I provided separately (from somewhere on the web) to build or
else the GCL internal GMP source (takes longer to build though).

To use the Axiom binary in the uploaded package, just:

1. make a directory "c:/cvs/head" (no other directory will do) and unzip
"axiom.tgz there,

2. put libgmp.dll in the "c:/cvs/head/mnt/windows/bin" directory,

3. double click in Windows explorer on the axiomSYS executable,

4. open a Windows command prompt and execute these two commands:

5. path c:\cvs\head\axiom\mnt\windows\bin;%path%

6. axiomSYS

Surprisingly I was also able to just double click in Windows Explorer on the
"axiomSYS.exe" binary in "c:/cvs/head/mnt/windows/bin" and get AXIOM to work
without setting any environment variables - it found the autoloads without
problems.

Cheers

Mike Thomas

The usual procedure is that there is a file named 'Makefile.in'
that is modified by ./configure to create the actual Makefile
with the proper paths and choice of options (if any) embedded.
I don't think the Axom ./configure script necessarily needs to
be based on autoconf etc. But I think it would be less confusing
for most if the way it works is modelled after what has become
a gnu standard.

I think this is easily possible. Perhaps it would be best if
it were to emulate some of the options usually found in
configure such as --prefix, --host, etc.

Maybe (if I ever find time) I will try to change the
configure file to do this. One possible complication is the
interaction with the Makefile.pamphlet file when it extracts
the host specific version. I wonder if it would make more
sense for that to occur during the ./configure step?

Bill Page.

Subject: Re: [Gcl-devel] pathname-name behavior change

Greetings, and thanks Tim for isolating the issue.

Rest assured that we will support the old behavior in our CLtL1
build/mode, so that axiom can change to ansi if and when it wants.
This is the raison d'etre of this build, which I consider a valuable
GCL feature.  Much of the heavy lifting in the lisp world has been
done under CLtL1 or the like, and we need to be ready to catch these
gems as they might propagate into the open source world.

This said, what we really mean by our CLtL1 build is a small build as
close to the original GCL as practicable which doesn't break anyone's
existing code.  There may be some ansi features we implement in this
build which don't happen to break such code.  The development process
in general is move to ansi in as straight a line as possible, see what
breaks when done, and revert the mods as necessary in CLtL1.  

This is much like gcc's support for K&R as well as ansi C, selected by
command line options.

I'll let you know when I pinpoint the location of modification and
commit a revert in the case of CLtL1.

BTW, axiom is already making use of this duality in its in-package
usage, which under ansi must trigger an error if the package does not
already exist.  We support the older behavior in CLtL1.

Take care,

Mike, are the warnings not issues on Linux, or is the warning
reporting code failing on Windows?  If the latter, can we isolate to a
lisp command?

I think this is the pathname-name case issue Tim reported.  Please let

Apologies for any difficulties you may be experiencing.  Full
configure and make output is critical for me to figure out what might
be impeding your attempts.

Yes, but I would not recommend using this, as it has a lot of untested
work vis a vis 2.6.5.  I'd rather suggest grabbing the solaris patch
off the errata site and applying it.

I am confused about '2.6.5a' -- there is no such version and I feel
this may be at the heart of your problem.

To my understanding, you can configure and build gcl in its own
directory, perhaps with setting some AXIOM environment variables to
find the 'extras', 'cp unixport/saved_gcl ../../obj/solaris/bin';
'touch ../gcldir', then go to the axiom source root and make as usual.

I say to my understanding as I have little experiece with building
axiom this way, so Tim might be of more help.  An alternate path would
be to start with an external built standard gcl tree with
<sourcedir>/bin in your path, apply the following axiom patch, and
then make as usual:

In general, the first step is for you to use either method, making
sure you have the solaris patch applied, and then post the full GCL
configure and make output.  Or perhaps provide ssh access to your
machine if you wish and I can take a look.

Kostas,

The gcl-2.6.5a was an failed attempt. Modify the GCLVERSION in the
top level Makefiles to read gcl-2.6.5 rather than gcl-2.6.5a and
you'll be back to the standard place. From there you can apply
any patches you want.

Also, if you follow the directions on http://arch.axiom-developer.org
for generating a key and then send me the key I can give you write

Subject: Re: [Axiom-mail] Function returning UnivariateTaylorSeries
Cc: Marcus Better

Hello,

I would like to give a final overview of what I have uncovered
regarding this dependent typing issue. Unfortunately the problems it
raises are quite extensive.

We could solve the initial problem wrt Marcus's Foo domain. The
problem is with the interpreter not performing type analysis on the
signature of the bar function:

     bar(): () -> UnivariateTaylorSeries(K, z, 0)

Eventually the signature itself is rewritten inside the interpreter,
but only the parameters from the domain Foo(K, z) are analyzed. The
0 is left untouched. 

It is possible to extend the interpreter to solve the class of
problems which this example represents. It amounts to writing some
code which performs coercions on signature parameters.

However, it is easy to come up with variations on the Foo domain which
would not be addressed. Here are two particularly troubling examples:

================================================================
)abbrev package FOO1 Foo1

Foo1(K, z): Exports == Implementation where
  K : Ring
  z : Symbol
  Exports == with
    bar1: () -> UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,0);
  Implementation == add
    bar1(): UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,0) ==
      st := generate(const(1)$MappingPackage2(K, K),0)$Stream(K)
      series(st)$UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,0)

)abbrev package FOO2 Foo2

Foo2(K, z): Exports == Implementation where
  K : Ring
  z : Symbol
  Exports == with
    bar2: K -> Stream K
  Implementation == add
    bar2(x: K): Stream K ==
      F := Foo1(K, z)
      uts := bar1()$F
      eval(uts, x)
================================================================

The Foo2 domain simply will not compile:

================================================================
   Compiling AXIOM source code from file /home/steve/tmp/foo2.spad 
      using old system compiler.
   FOO2 abbreviates package Foo2 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   initializing NRLIB FOO2 for Foo2 
   compiling into NRLIB FOO2 
   compiling exported bar2 : K -> Stream K
****** comp fails at level 1 with expression: ******
error in function bar2 

(0)
****** level 1  ******
$x:= 0
$m:= K
$f:=
((((|uts| #) (F #) (|last| #) (|rest| #) ...)))
 
   >> Apparent user error:
   Cannot coerce 0 
      of mode (NonNegativeInteger) 
      to mode K 

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
================================================================

This implies that even if we were to extend the interpreter to handle
`signature coercions' we would still not be able to use our domains
for general library development, as this is a compiler issue.


Another example is the following variation on the original Foo:

================================================================
)abbrev package FOO3 Foo3

Foo3(K, z): Exports == Implementation where
  K : Ring
  z : Symbol
  Exports == with
    bar3: (c:K) -> UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,c);
  Implementation == add
    bar3(c:K): UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,c) ==
      st := generate(const(1)$MappingPackage(K, K),c)$Stream(K)
      series(st)$UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,c)
================================================================

Trying to compile a domain which uses Foo3 will fail. 

Trying to use Foo3 directly will invoke a problem in the interpreter
similar to the one invoked by Foo1. The problem is more severe in this
case since the signature is:

   bar3: (c:K) -> UnivariateTaylorSeries(K,z,c)

As before, K and z will be properly rewritten w.r.t the domain
parameters. Whats left for the interpreter to deduce is what the
symbol 'c' means. As far as I can tell, this information is simply not
available. The database information produced by the compiler gives
type information for bar3's arguments -- nothing with respect to
the binding of symbols to formal parameters. 

Interestingly, the compiler generates a file `info', which for Foo3
looks like this:

================================================================

((|bar| (((|UnivariateTaylorSeries| K |z| |c|) K)
         ((|UnivariateTaylorSeries| K |z| |c|)
          (|series| (|UnivariateTaylorSeries| K |z| |c|) (|Stream| K))
          (|One| (|UnivariateTaylorSeries| K |z| |c|)))
         ((|Stream| K) (|generate| (|Stream| K) (|Mapping| K K) K))
         ((|MappingPackage2| K K) (|const| (|Mapping| K K) K))
         (|locals| (|st| |Stream| K)) (|arguments| (|c| . K))
         (K (|One| K))))) 

================================================================

Notice the `(|arguments| (|c| . K))' form. I am not sure when or how
this info file is used, but it does contain the information we would
need. A general solution to this problem would probably involve an
extension to the database such that the formal argument bindings are
available to the interpreter.

Clearly, tackling this problem would require a solid understanding of
both the compiler and interpreter -- something I do not posses.

I will keep these issues in mind as I learn more about axioms
internals. 

Perhaps down the road there could be an axiom-langextension-1 branch
which could serve as a playpen for exploring and formalizing axioms
dependent type system.

If you're interested I'd be happy to make a branch for this.
Follow the directions on http://arch.axiom-developer.org for making a key
and send it to me. I'll add you to the authorized_key file.

If you're going to hack into the lisp code I'd greatly appreciate
documenting and comments on what you come to understand as well as
changes to the code. That will make it so much easier to merge later.

I haven't had time to reach all the way up to the spad code level
as there have been various fires burning at the build level.

I suspect not as I had the same symptom 6 months ago with an earlier stable
GCL (perhaps 2.6.2?).  Perhaps some other bug since fixed which
coincidentally duplicates that symptom, but...

Yes, Axiom was the last serious barrier in relation to application support
on  Windows relative to the Unix platforms.  Next on the plate is to return
to 2.6.5 and ensure that the recent patches haven't broken anything on
Windows.  I think I will also have to bring it up to scratch for the current
MinGW32 gcc version.

Frankly, I would like to dump 2.6.x ASAP.

Have a pleasant evening,

Absolutely. Indeed, as I study the code further, the first
contributions I am likely to make will be in the form of
documentation. The literate programming paradigm is one I adhere to in
my personal projects as well.

Great. I have downloaded it and completed a few tests. It
seems to be fully functional. Congratulations!!!

I was very pleasantly surprized to see that AXIOMsys under
windows works with the usual 'gnu readline' line editing.
So it seems we do not need to worry about the clef program.

Since I know several other people are anxious to try Axiom
on Windows, I just couldn't resist preparing a zip file
directly from your uploaded files but containing just the
minimum distribution files (about 45 Mbytes) and some simple
instructions for a manual installation. See updated instructions
here:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload

Of course I have to emphasize to everyone that this is "use
at your own risk" software. Axiom as a whole is still at the
pre-release stage. But I think wider testing and feedback
would be very useful.

That is because by default Axiom looks in the place where
it was built for these files. So if you run it from where
it was built, no problem. But if you move Axiom to another
location (the usual case, e.g. c:\Program Files), then you
must set the AXIOM environment variable

  AXIOM=c:/Program Files/axiom/mnt/windows

(See instructions on above web page).

Note that it seems necessary that the slashes in this variable
must be forward / not the usual windows backslash \.

Hi Bill.

Short on time here this arvo but a quick comment - it isn't readline, just
the normal Windows command line editing - on Windows 98 etc that won't be
present if I recall correctly?

Pleased to hear everything was fine for you!

Odd. very odd. 
Perhaps X isn't allowing userid bt to open windows? try 'xhost +'
For some reason you can't get pseudo-terminals. This used to be 
a problem way back in history because systems were only set up to
allow 2-3 ptys but modern systems are usually configed with more.
Did you do your own kernel build? Is this a standard distro?

Subject: Running Axiom in Texmacs for Windows (was: [Texmacs-dev] Plugins)
Cc: Mike Thomas, Bill Page

Dan,

I know this would not be considered a final solution, but
I have found a way to work around the problems of compiling
tm_axiom.c under windows. tm_axiom.c uses the unix-isms fork
and pipe which are not available under vanilla windows so
tm_axiom.c would have to be seriously re-written in order
to run under native Windows.

But I found that if I copied tm_axiom.exe from the cygwin
distribution of texmacs (which I also happen to have on
this system)

  C:\cygwin\usr\sbin\TeXmacs\bin\tm_axiom.exe

and the cygwin library

  C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll library

into

  C:\Program Files\WinTeXmacs\TeXmacs\bin

then the new version of Axiom for Windows works with Texmacs
for Windows! Of course cygwin is providing the fork and pipe
emulation that is needed for the unix version of tm_axiom.

In principle, tm_axiom.c is a fairly simple filter program.
Perhaps you or someone on the texmacs-dev list could point
me to a simple example of a native Windows program that does
the same thing? I could try to produce a new version of
tm_axiom.c for the windows distribution.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Subject: RE: Running Axiom in Texmacs for Windows (was:[Texmacs-dev] Plugins)

Hi Bill/Dan.

I've attached some code which shows how to launch a subprocess with
redirected stdin/out on Windows, which you might like to incorporate into
tm_axiom.c.  I haven't run it for a couple of years but I recall that it
worked when last I tried!

The _spawn family of functions on Windows does almost exactly what fork/exec
does on Unix; you also have _dup2, _pipe etc.  The examples switchable by
macro to use the pure Win32 functions CreateProcess etc and also to redirect
stderr; I made these programs as a learning exercise at the time.  The
threading in this code is, I expect, not relevant to tm_axiom.c and can
safely be disregarded.

You can find the MSDN docs on these functions by googling for "msdn
_spawnvp" etc.

When you both understand how to build the windows version it
would be useful to write an INSTALL file and put it on the
top level of the axiom--windows--1 branch. --t

Subject: MathAction upgraded ZWiki-0.36.2 - now has preview option

All,

I have upgraded the MathAction wiki software (ZWiki) to
the latest 0.36.2 release that includes the new preview
option. Now instead of having to press Save to see the
result of your editing, you can choose Preview. Preview
does not save the changes you have made and it does not
send email notices to subscribers. Instead a preview of
what the page will look like appears below the edit window.
If this preview is satisfactory, the user will click on
Save, if not they can continue editing and Preview again
until the desired result is achieved. When the final Save
is clicked, email notices will be sent to all subscribers.

This means that as a subscriber you will no longer be
subjected to a quick series of edit notices as someone
tries to correct and properly format a page.

The preview function applies both to the MathAction wiki
as well as wiki pages inside the Axiom Portal.

Please let me know if you have any problems with this.

Mike,

I have been trying to build the Windows version from the
source that you provided, but I am stuck and a little
confused about what to do with gmp libraries. My build log
stops at the point of link raw_gcl with a list of missing
gmp symbols. When I compare it to your build log I can
see that you have a -lgmp where I do not. Is this something
put there by ./configure because it found something on your
system that is not on mine? Am I missing some ./configure
option in the lsp/Makefile.pamphlet file?

Below you refer to using a static gmp library. How precisely
would a do that? (Sorry to be so dense about this :) Any
clues or references would help.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Not dense at all.  I'm assuming here that the source tree you have contains
everything I used including the CVS HEAD GCL - I haven't had time to check
yet.

The -lgmp is being pout there by configure automatically.

If you look in that gmp tar ball I uploaded you'll find a "libgmp.a" which
you should put in the MinGW32 gcc lib directory, and "gmp.h" which goes in
the include directory.

The configure script should pick those up.

If you're using GCL 2.6.5 I don't remember if it autodetects the gmp library
or not.

If completely stuck, you may need to play around with the configure argument
"--enable-dynsysgmp".

Hi Bill,

After looking at tm_axiom.c, it looks like it would be very easy to re-write
this for windows.  You can use Mike's provided sample code, or you may even
use my pipe.c/h which provides a very simple API to do this type of thing
(since texmacs does it already).  I have attached them.

Tim, *

I have a simple patch which I am ready to upload. It fixes the
following bug:

===============================================
(1) -> )f i n

BOOT>(quit)

-- restart Axiom

(1) -> )f
   Your command is ambiguous. The following are abbreviated by f :
      fin 
      frame 
(1) ->
===============================================

The problem is in src/interp/int-top.boot, function `intloopPrefix?'.

Would you prefer I upload such changes to the axiom--language--1
branch, and send you notification that it would be relevant to
axiom--main--1? Or would you prefer a patch file and I'll simply keep
in sync with axiom--main--1? I have one more patch in the works
relevant to the main archive (a simple grammar issue in the message
database). 

Once the patch is applied, I would very much appreciate anyones
criticisms/comments regarding its style, etc. Its rather verbose for
such a small fix, but I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to
receive some feedback before I commit changes which involve more
involved issues. Please be harsh.

Steve,

feel free to change anything you like in the branches.
the point of the branches is to allow people to experiment and
cooperate.

there is no guarantee that a branch will even compile.
and since your name is associated with axiom--language--1 i'd
expect people who change it to coordinate with you, if only as
a courtesy.

re: axiom--main--1 branch

i'm using the axiom--main--* branch to merge changes for testing
before porting them to the savannah cvs so i'd prefer to receive
changes as diffs.

Please run the diffs as:

diff -Naur origfile changedfile >dir.dir.dir.origfile.patch

so, if you changed src/interp/foo.pamphlet and saved it as 
src/interp/foo.pamphlet.new you would do:

cd src/interp
diff -Naur foo.pamphlet foo.pamphlet.new > src.interp.foo.pamphlet.patch

That way I can keep track of what is patched and where. Plus it is easier
to read the diffs to decide what is changed and how well documented the
change is.

Note that the branches are tagged to particular axiom--main builds.
Thus if you send me a patch for src/interp/foo.pamphlet and I merge
it into axiom--main--1 you will NOT see the change appear in, say,
axiom--language--1. That is because axiom--language--1 is tagged to
axiom--main--1--patch-9. Your new change will appear after patch-9.
So if you also want the patch in axiom--language--1 you'll need to
apply it there.

I would suggest that you write a simple bug report and a simple patch and send
both to savannah. The patch should contain the bug number. After submitting the
patch you get a patch number. Then you comment the bug with the patch number.

This way
* it is clear that there was a bug
* it is clear that it is fixed.
* if the patch causes problems, it is easy to detect this and unapply it. (each
  release should contain notes which patches have been applied)

I'm ready to be convinced otherwise,

Martin

This is what I expected. Thank you for the details.

Yes, I understand the route one must take to keep one branch in sync
with another. I feel that `tracking' main as much as possible will
aid a merge down the road. 

I'm in a rush at the moment. I'll send the afore mentioned patch later
on today.

could i ask you to write a simple paragraph that i can add to the FAQ

using, what the symptom was, and what you did to fix it. it might

Tim,

Please find attached the afore mentioned patches.

They together solve two issues related to system commands. 

 o  `) f i n' no longer means `)fin'. Required fixing `intloopPrefix?'
    and modifying `intloopReadConsole' in src/interp/int-top.boot.pamphlet

 o  Added some simple argument checking to `handleNoParseCommands' in
    src/interp/i-syscmd.boot.pamphlet. Instead of, for example:

    ================================================================
    (1) -> )lisp
 
       >> System error:
       Unexpected end of #<string-input stream from "">.

    protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
    (1) -> )boot
 
       >> System error:
       The function |boot| is undefined.

    protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
    (1) -> )credits 2
 
       >> System error:
       The function |npcredits| is undefined.

    protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
    ================================================================

    We now have something a little more consistent:

    ================================================================
    (1) -> )lisp
       Your argument list is not valid.
    (1) -> )boot
       Your argument list is not valid.
    (1) -> )credits 2
       Your argument list is not valid.
    ================================================================


I know these are small changes, but the system commands might be one
of the first things a new user will learn (they were for me, at
least). First impressions can mean a lot.

If you feel these should not be applied to main, please let me know,
since I'll apply them to axiom--language--1 independently rather than
track a change in main.

Again, any criticism/comments would be appreciated. 

Sincerely,
Steve

+The [[intloopPrefix?(prefix, whole)]] function simply tests if the string
+[[prefix]] is a prefix of the string [[whole]]. The original
+implementation discounts {\sl any} whitespace in [[whole]] in deciding a
+match, when a more sensible behavior would be to discount only leading
+whitespace.
+
+Moreover, the function SUBSTRING\cite{2} was being improperly called.
+The reason why this improper call had gone undetected is that
+generally [[intloopPrefix?]] is invoked with a prefix string of length
+one -- hence the start position for the substring would generally
+begin at index [[spaces]] (which is what we want).
+
+The original code read:
+\begin{verbatim}
+intloopPrefix?(prefix,whole) ==
+     #prefix > #whole => false
+     good:=true
+     spaces := 0
+     i := 0

+     spaces = wlen => nil
+     if good then SUBSTRING(whole,#prefix+spaces-1,nil) else good

Thank you both very much for your help. These examples
were very instructional and inspiring. Really. But as
Tim Daly always says: "There ain't no such thing as
a simple job!" ... :) After about a days work, however
I do have a radically revised version of the tm_axiom
program that seems to work very well under Windows. I
have attached the zip file containing the source program
and compiled code (compiled on MinGW/MSYS).

In the end I basically opted for the style and example
provided by Mike (though I am Dan's approach would have
probably worked nearly as well). The thing that I enjoyed
about Mike's version was the use of threads. It seems to
me that this "light weight" kind of process handling is
one of the things that Windows actually does very well
and so for a Windows version, I decided I would like to
learn more about this. Too my great pleasure some simple
experiments seemed to show that it was indeed faster than
the Cygwin version that uses the old Unix fork and pipe
approach. Cygwin TeXmacs users should be able to benefit
directly from this new version. But it might also be
worthwhile investigating backporting this new version of
tm_axiom (I called it tmwin_axiom) back to Unix.

The program is written in old fashioned vanilla C.

Perhaps this experience will be relevant when it comes
to porting some of the other components (graphics
hyperdoc, etc.) to Windows.

Anyway, I would be very pleased if you could give this
version a try. I would like to include it in the pre-
release Windows distribution of Axiom that we now have
on the MathAction web site.

Subject: writeup for faq on sman/devpts problem

Hi,
Here is the writeup you asked for . 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q Graphics don't work or sman fails to start ?

First try running sman as :
sman -debug -noclef -nonag -noht
Try this as root also.
If graphics still don't work or sman fails to start then
look at the error messages . Does it show something like :

ptyopen: Failed to grant access to slave device: No such file or directory
ptyopen: Failed to get name of slave device: No such file or directory
ptyopen: Failed to open slave: Bad address

If so you may need to do a few things 
1) Make sure that devpts support is enabled in you kernel 
   ( CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y )
2) Make sure the directory /dev/pts exists
3) Mount devpts as in :
   "mount -t devpts devpts /dev/pts"
   You may also want to add the following line to your /etc/fstab file
   devpts          /dev/pts        devpts  gid=5,mode=602          0       0
   This will ensure that next time you reboot devpts is automatically
   mounted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This got graphics working for me and it looks great . I will ofcourse
be playing around and testing it further and will make a post if something
comes up. I am using Debian woody (stable) distribution with kernel 2.4.19.
This may or may not be a problem due to the age of this rather old linux
distribution. Debian sarge is expected soon and hopefully this should not
be an issue. I am not sure if devpts is mounted by default on debian
testing and/or unstable.

PS:You may find the following article interesting if you have
not seen it already :

Subject: RE: Running Axiom in Texmacs for Windows (was:	[Texmacs-dev] Plug ins)

All,

Having produced now for the third time a revision of the
TeXmacs Axiom interface program (the most recent one for
Windows), I have begun to think that we should revisit our
decision of last year not to distribute a version of this
program with Axiom. At the time we all seemed to feel that
it would be better if these interface programs where only
included with the TeXmacs distribution itself.

But despite a year of quite good progress with both
TeXmacs and Axiom, I notice that we still have a serious
problem with TeXmacs inability to fold Axiom's sometimes
rather long LaTeX output. We do have a solution written
many years ago by Robert Sutor in the form a C program
filter. I originally modified the Texmacs-Axiom interface
program to include this filter and the result was that
TeXmacs could then do a very good job of reproducing the
examples in the Axiom book and tutorials. Unfortunately
the developers of TeXmacs decided not to accept this
revised interface program for the TeXmacs distribution.

In the mean time I have also incorporated Sutors's line-
breaker program in the MathAction wiki to solve the same
problem with very long LaTeX lines. It seems to me that this
filter program is working very reliably. Therefore I think
I would like to add the line-breaker code into the newly
revised TeXmacs-Axiom interface program. Do this would make
that new program more than 90% new source code that is only
loosely based on the original TeXmacs version. So I think
it would be well justified to include this program with
our Axiom distributions.

What do other people think?

Please replace the previous zip file of the same name
with the attached updated version.

Of course the version I sent out earlier this mornig
yielded to a little more testing. I found and fixed
some problems with the way it handled and displayed
syntax and other errors. Other than that, it seems
quite stable. Let me know if it works ok for you when
you get a chance.

Thanks.

Bill Page.

Bill,

Perhaps you should check this code into the axiom--windows--1
branch so we can keep it where it can be maintained as part
of the port.

axiom--t--1

Bill,

As usual, you're a few emails ahead of me. 

Yes, we should move the texmacs support of axiom to become
the axiom support of texmacs.

I suggest you make a src/texmacs subdir and check the code
into the windows branch. From there we can make it do line-breaking,
move the code into pamphlet format, and update the src/Makefile.pamphlet
to handle the new subdir and code compiles.

Once that is done we can look at merging the changes into the main
branch.

Balbir,

The FAQ file in axiom--main--1 has been updated.
This will be posted in the savannah CVS at the next release.

re: Wester

I've known him for years although we've never met in person.
He's been active for a very long time and does excellent work.
It's good to see that he released this document. 

If you look at src/doc/Rosetta.pamphlet that document was originally
written by him, modified by me and Hulpke (of GAP fame), and used 
with Wester's permission.

I think we can learn a lot from his book in terms of questions to
address and work to do. The axiom system has not changed significantly
from the 1997 version so most of his complaints are still valid.

The point is that we feel that the formula breaking code should
rather be improved in TeXmacs itself, so as to benefit to all
plug-ins at the same time. Of course, you may do things manually
by yourself for each plug-in, but should not forget to remove
this code when TeXmacs will do things better.

Oh, you mean do it the right way? ;)

I don't know if you have been looking at the MathAction
web statistics yet, but I think the following facts are
quite interesting:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/usage/usage_200412.html#TOPURLS

According to this, the recently (< 48 hrs.) uploaded version of
Axiom for Windows (axiom-windows-0.1.0.zip) is quite popular!
There have been more than 29 downloads since in was uploaded
Wednesday night. These statistics are current as of 11:45 PM
yesterday. The "Total URLs By KBytes" table shows that the
total downloads is already approaching one terabyte.

The another thing that surprizes me is how popular the
bibliography section on the Axiom Portal is. Looking at the
same totals for last month (November) confirms this since
it is ranked in 6th place in terms of the number of hits.
In comparison to other high content pages, this was only
really exceed by MathAction - both getting about 450 hits
during the month.

I think we are really going to blow your bandwidth margins
this month! I hope more people will be getting into the
"spirit of giving" mood as this year draws to a close.
The number of hits on the donation links is still far too
small to even show up on in these web stats.

Many thanks for your patch, which does solve the problem.
I can't remember exactly the original design decision about this,
but it was probably the case, and it's a good design to assume now anyways.

Regarding your other questions, I would pick the safe side and not
unintern previously interned symbols in resetNew()  (better to waste

Just try to expand (x+y+z)^10 in asxiom under TeXmacs. Currently, with 
TeXmacs doing line breaking, the output is perfect. With this C code 
inserted into tm_axiom the output contained unbalanced large brackets, 
and was absolutely useless and broken.

But that is trivial. If the C code is not doing it right
I think it can be easily fixed. (But see evidence to the
contrary at the web site below.)

Try this in TeXmacs instead

  (1/x+y+z)^10

This doesn't seem to happen using exactly the same code on
MathAction. See

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/VeryLongLaTeX

The only difference is that the mathematics is rendered on
MathAction using LaTeX. Perhaps the problem you are seeing
is related to a LaTeX to TeXmacs conversion problem.

How odd. One of the changes in that patch was to remove an escaped,
non-printable, character embedded in a print statement. The escape
sequence was intended to be seen by the terminal, triggering boldface,
color, etc. This is clearly not the best method for triggering such
behavior. Moreover, TeX does not accept such characters. 

My emailer set the encoding to `quoted-printable' instead of
`7bit'. I dont see the = problem here. It seems likely the patch
was effected during transfer (I tested that the patches applied
properly before I sent them). 

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to fix this.

If you did get it working under wintexmacs, please provide the following

2) Where would the standard distribution be installed on a typical windows

Yes, I have installed it in wintexmacs and used it in place
of the Cygwin version. So far it seems to be working fine

No, just start use

  Insert/Session/Axiom

and start typing Axiom commands.

This has not been decided yet but yes, I have my copy installed in

  c:\Program Files\axiom\mnt\windows

There are a number of sub-directories include one called bin
where the programs are stored. Other sub-directories include
things like the algebra library files etc.

That is the name of the interface program. I believe that it is
configurable in some script that is specific to each "plug=in" but
such configuration requires some extra skill and knowledge - not
for a beginning user.

Anyway, I think that TeXmacs currently looks for the actual
external program. In the case of Axiom TeXmacs looks for an
executable named AXIOMsys - the main Axiom program. Axiom showed
up right away when I installed your version of TeXmacs on the
same system where I had already installed Axiom. I think all
that it needed was for AXIOMsys to be in the path. But it
would not run because it tried to load the tm_axiom plugin
which it assumed was in one of the TeXmacs directories as in
the case of the linux distribution.

All that I had to do was provide TeXmacs with an executable
named tm_axiom and put it a place where TeXmacs could run
it. I haven't tried but I presume that it would probably
work any place in the PATH. In my case I copied it directly
in the TeXmacs bin sub-directory.

Since it seems that many of the external routines that assist
TeXmacs with interfacing with other systems will have to be
re-written specifically for Windows, perhaps it would be less
confusing of they were given Windows version specific names,
e.g. tmwin_axiom.exe

TeXmacs seems to find Axiom automatically already (provided that
it is configured to run from the command line via the PATH).

Because of the difference between the general conventions and layouts of 
Linux vs. Windows, I had to add some extra functionality for the PATH issue. 
What wintexmacs does is the following.

1) On first use, searches for known binaries.  When found, it adds the path 
to the pluginpaths.txt file.
2) From then on, when wintexmacs loads, it adds the each path in 
pluginpaths.txt to it's own PATH variable.  This is to remove the user 
having to add the path manually (as most windows users do not want to do).

So, I can add the search binary to wintexmacs list, then it will pick up the 
path automatically.  If you don't think this is necessary, then I won't add 
it.

Dan,

Agreed. Most applications are installed into a standard location
and many even make entries in the Windows registry. But all of
that is quite foriegn to unix developers (although some unix/linux
distributions are becoming more standardized, e.g. debian).

> So, I can add the search binary to wintexmacs list, then

The question is: what to look for. Should it look for the actual
program itself (e.g. AXIOMsys as the Linux version currently does,
even though it can not use it directly)? Or should it look for
the interface program? Up until recently the interface programs
were considered by the TeXmacs developers as part of the TeXmacs
system and not part of the external system. But if some external
systems begin to develop their own TeXmacs-specific interfaces,
(such as the Axiom developers and now comtemplating) then it would
make more sense for TeXmacs to look for the interface program.

I have no idea how workable this is, but would it be possible to
combine the windows axiom, wintexmacs, and whatever other pieces are
needed into a single installable archive?  I can't help thinking it
would be really cool to have something like the following:

a) use InnoSetup (or another such tool, but InnoSetup is totally free
and has so far worked very well with Maxima releases) to make the
archive+install dialogs.  Check out the current Maxima windows release
for an example.  This will result in one very large but totally self
contained installable.

b) Set up an icon+startup config so clicking on an Axiom icon will
start up TeXmacs with an Axiom session in it.  Wala, a nice clean
spiffy user experience out of the box.  Can TeXmacs be set up that way?

I dunno if this makes much sense, but given how big Axiom is anyway and
how fast the internet has become, mightn't it be worth the extra space
to have a package like that?

About a Windows package install: Yes this is very possible.
For example Dick Martins is already packaging his TeXmacs

http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/download/windows.en.html

I think he is quickly becoming an expert at such packaging.
If we are real nice to him and influence him to become
involved with Axiom, then maybe we can get him to do it for
use <grin> (or at least get some helpful hints.) Maybe he
would be interested in creating a combined distribution
as you suggest.

A combined install for Axiom and wintexmacs.....hmmm  The only problem is 
that it would be absolutlely huge.  Is there a big demand for such an 
install?

For our install, we used the Nullsoft installer system.  I used to use 
installshield, but one of our users/developers turned me on to NSIS.  It is 
an awsome and powerful package.  The scripting is very similar to assembly 
and it puts out a nice build.

Do you have a windows install package yet for axiom?

Great. Did you get a chance to modify the 'axiom' script
to include graphics?

Here are a couple of problems I have noticed with the
graphics so far.

------ example axiom output ----

(4) -> draw(sin(x)^2/x^2,x=0..10)            
   Compiling function %H with type DoubleFloat -> DoubleFloat 
   Graph data being transmitted to the viewport manager...
   AXIOM2D data being transmitted to the viewport manager...

   (4)  TwoDimensionalViewport: "DSIN(x)**2/(x*x)"
                                                 Type:
TwoDimensionalViewport
(5) -> Cannot open
/home/wspage/axiom-build/mnt/linux/../../share/graph/header.ps to read.

------

The graph is drawn with the title just as show above
starting with a 'D'. Where did that come from?

The second problem was caused when I clicked on the
PS button on the 2D Control Panel. It seems that the
file header.ps is missing.

The problem is obviously that Gfun.c looks in the wrong
place. A quick patch file is below for your convenience.
Later I will try to use arch to patch axiom--main--1.

Note: After making the change Gfun.c, make took a very long
time to get to the point of rebuilding the graphics programs.
It did things like re-build AXIOMsys and the daase files
before getting around to the graphdir. Is there a short-cut?
Can we not be make this more efficient by including some
dependencies in the part that makes the databases so that
it doesn't get rebuilt if it doesn't have to? Do you have
any hints on how to do this?

Subject: postscript files from Axiom graphics

Tim,

After patching the Gfun.c.pamphlet (see previous message)
I can now click the PS button and also use the write function
e.g.

  graph1:=draw(sin(x),x=0..1)
  write(graph1,"graphs","postscript")

The resulting postscript file is named axiom2D.ps in the
directory

  /home/wspage/graphs.VIEW

I can view this with ghostview with no problem except that
it appears in black and white where the graph being displayed
in the view port was in color. (Perhaps I missed some option
to create a color postscript file?)

-----

So now that I have done this interactively, it appears that
writing the postscript is actually done by the view2D program.
view2D does not start if I try to run sman in a console
outside the X-windows environment. And if I start Axiom with
AXIOMsys the Axiom commands above fail with the message
"viewport already closed". (It was never opened.) So for use
in MathAction I am wondering how to generate postscript files
"in batch" and without X-windows present. Can you think of
any way to do this?

Subject: Re: postscript files from Axiom graphics

Bill,

re: make doing more work than required.

yes, this needs to be cleaned up. in general the makefiles are
designed to do the absolute minimum amount of work.

the technique i use is the same one i use on noweb. make has the
property that if you have a stanza with no dependencies you can
use this as a "marker". so for noweb you'll see that i have a
stanza:


noweb:
	.......	
	echo "mark that we built noweb" >noweb

which creates a file called noweb. as long as that file exists
this stanza will never be rerun. removing the noweb file indicates
that this stanza needs to be rerun.

this technique was used to keep interpsys from being
rebuilt when not required. interpsys loads a subset of the
algebra. i determined this subset by a frequency analysis of
the file loads. the top N files were chosen to be preloaded
into the image because they are used so often.

so there should be an interpsys marker file which guards against
unnecessary rebuilds. however the stanzas for files that get 
preloaded need to erase this marker file in order to force the
rebuild. this is work yet to be done.

re: Gfun.c.pamphlet

please diff -Naur Gfun.c.pamphlet and Gfun.c.pamphlet.new 
and send me the diff. 

re: color

there are a lot of options possible while creating graphs, none
of which i remember so we'll have to drag them out of the code
and document them both in the code.pamphlet files and in 
bookvol1.pamphlet (the tutorial volume in book--main--1).

as an aside, you'll note that the book is now in 3 volumes
 bookvol1 -- tutorial
 bookvol2 -- programming
 bookvol3 -- reference

re: batch generation

we did this when we made the axiom images in the book.
i believe some of the code lives in appendix F of the book.
however, it is possible we had X around.

the issue is two-fold. first, axiom needs to write the data
from the formulas. second, there is a program called viewAlone
which can display that data. Automating the first step should
be reasonably easy. I believe the functions to do it exist.

In order to display the data there is a program
[[src/graph/viewAlone]] which gets built by the make. If you look at
the file [[src/graph/fileformats.pamphlet]] you'll see that i've
documented the file formats used by viewAlone, at least in the 2D case.  
you can run this program on the file [[int/graph/parabola]]

i don't remember how the postscript generation is done but i know
we wrote a bunch of postscript macros. however the ps
generation occurs it is likely that it does not depend on X.
we may have to modify the code to give a "-batch" fastpath.

Constantine,
 
I picked up a copy of matlab and one of the books. 
I'll try installing it later this week and then I can
help you with your translation problems. I'm not familiar
with Matlab.

Matlab seems, at first reading, to be somewhat primitive but
perhaps I'm missing the point. In any case it clearly provides
functionality that the student needs in some easy to use form.

Perhaps we can learn some lessons from it and create a "matlab
compatibility package" that covers the functions in ways that
a matlab user can understand.

Well, it's a bit hard to tell I guess.  My logic is basically thus:

a)  Windows end users are used to installs with a minimum of user
effort.
b)  Windows is likely to be the largest distribution platform (sad but
true based on Maxima's download figures.)
c)  The speed of modern internet connections (and the size of Axiom by
itself - already over 40 megs) would seem to suggest that another
ten-fifteen megs or so probably won't make or break the download.
d)  A positive, simple install experience + the Axiom book + a pretty
TeXmacs interface will do a lot to convince people checking out the
package that enough effort has been put into the user experience for it
to be more worthwhile than it is frustrating.  From experience, the
typical response of a Windows user to hearing about a program is
something along the lines of "cool, where can I download it" and they
don't even think about downloading and hand configuring other
components.  To them it is a sign of an immature program, at least from
a user experience standpoint.

Hmm.  Haven't used that one, but it looks nice.

Hi Bill.

Sorry to be out of touch when you are so obviously ready to get to work but
I've been flat out over the past week on other stuff.

I had hoped last week to reproduce your source tree, but I've yet to succeed
in getting a clean ssh arch download of the Windows source; I get hung
processes during patch application and network timeouts, but that is a
separate story which I hope to look at more closely this week.

The other alternative is just to let GCL build GMP from the sources in the
build tree, but I believe from your description that you were effectively
doing that in the first instance.  Hopefully the logs will help.

Mike,

I also found hung processes during the patch phase of the download 
to your box. I meant to mention it to you. I thought at first it
was a lack of space (which went away as a probable cause after
I started using /usr/axiom). My experience was that the process
always failed at the second or third patch.

It can't be your version of tla because I compiled my own (unless
I was using your version accidently.

I eventually solved the problem by doing the tla on another system,
tgz'd it up and then using scp to copy it to your system and unpack it.

I am *not* working with the arch axiom--windows--1 source
(yet). I just wanted instead to begin with your original
axiom.tgz that you uploaded to axiom-developer.org and
reproduce exactly what you had done. After succeeding at
that, then I am planning to start work on the version in
arch - which should be the same, but one can never be to
over confident...

well, hypertex worked. sort of. occasionally.

if you're coding C this is a must-have tool. 

it would be amusing to run GCL under valgrind.

There are a few places in Axiom where an expression needs to be
linearised: this is one of them and printing parameterised types is
another.  Somebody had the bright idea of using the facility for
conversion to Fortran (which I wrote) which by default uses the double
precision names for intrinsic functions, with the results you see.  I
remember reporting this as a bug when Axiom was still an IBM project,
before it even came to NAG!

Hi Tim/Bill.

Thanks for that.

I gave up on the ssh checkout for today and just used tla under a Windows
command prompt to check out the code.  I will now try for a  GCL version
2.6.5 build to ensure that all Axiom platforms are working off the same GCL
code base.

I've already found one infelicity and need to find out your standard process
for generating those Makefile.pamphlet patches to the GCL source tree -
specifically, what "diff" command line arguments do you use to make each
patch?

Bill, I'm interested in seeing that extra information if you can still be
bothered to chase your own GCL HEAD build.  I think it would be good to try
uncovering the problem so that you can gain some faith in the process.

I spent odd moments over the weekend (text mode) and today (Windows
TeXmacs - no cygwin involved at all) trying to crash Axiom and or TeXmacs.
I'm very pleased to report that I failed completely.  My main attack has
been to type in code snippets which solve specific problems from the Axiom
book and various web sites.  Axiom is certainly a stunning program.

I'm also hoping that someone on the Maxima development team will build a
tm_maxima equivalent for Windows based on Bill's superb weekend efforts.  I
just wish we had savable worksheets for both CAS systems - TeXmacs seems not
to be able to do that yet.

Attached is a picture of Windows Axiom in TeXmacs.

Bill, I can send you an up to date PDF copy of the Axiom book built from CVS
if you would like to include it in your web zip file.

ok, so i'm a LITTLE behind in fixing bugs :-)
it's likely the bug was on my desk at ibm. 
hopefully this will get fixed this time.

Subject: re: postscript files from Axiom graphics

Bill,

Another partially-implemented feature that will minimize the work
done and accomplish your goal is the "PART=" mechanism.

You will eventually be able to type:

make PART=graphics

and only the graphics will be rebuilt. This mechanism used to
exist and I have not yet recovered it.

Subject: axiom on AMD64

I am trying to build CVS axion (from December 5) on AMD64. I am 
using `fedora64' target (my machine is a Mandrake 9.1, but Fedora
looks close enough ...). I have noticed two problems:

when running `r21bugsbig' axiom spent 7 hours after printing the
line:

g : LX := reduce(*, [X - rho for rho in r]) ;

I had to kill axiom process to go further. 

Next problem is that library settinge form the `Makefile.fedora64',
namely the line:
 
LDF:="-L/usr/X11R6/lib64 -L/usr/local/lib64 -L/usr/openwin/lib64 -L/usr/lib64 "

apparently did not propagate to `view2D' directory. More precisely,
the build failed at link stage:

34 linking /pom/kompi/axiom/axiom2/mnt/fedora64/lib/view2D
gcc-3.3.1: /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a: No such file or directory
make[4]: *** [/pom/kompi/axiom/axiom2/mnt/fedora64/lib/view2D] Error 1
make[4]: Leaving directory `/pom/kompi/axiom/axiom2/src/graph/view2D'
make[3]: *** [view2Ddir] Error 2

PS. I have September version working (build after hand tweaks). I am
rebuilding to get `sman' running.

Subject: RE: Lulu publishing

I would like to here more from subscribers to axiom-developer
about our current plans to publish a series of Axiom books
on Lulu. Tim Daly has setup the arch repository book--main--1
with 3 volumes:

 bookvol1 -- tutorial
 bookvol2 -- programming
 bookvol3 -- reference

Our goal is to get the Volume 1 out to press in Lulu as
soon as possible. 95% of this volume is complete, but it
would be great to have more proof reading and corrections
by other people.

We were also hoping to include a CDrom with volume 1, but
we received a quotation from Lulu which calls for a minimum
publishing run of 100 copies at an up front cost of about
$1,200 USD for a 250 page volume including a CDrom. So far the
limited donations to the Axiom Foundation would not let us
seriously consider this option.

---------

Here is an article about Lulu and publishing open source software:

http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/11/10/2135209

Lulu.com is the brainchild of Red Hat founder Bob Young. With Lulu,
Young offers would-be publishers, whether book authors, musicians,
photographers, or artists, the opportunity to expose and sell their
work for little or no upfront investment. But Lulu.com is more than
just an on-demand publishing house. True to the open spirit, it is
also a community -- a haven where artistic people can gather to share
experiences and seek advice from one another. They can network,
looking for opportunities to collaborate and muster up creative
synergy. It is open and it is free. And now, it is for software
developers too.

Lulu this month announced http://www.lulu.com/static/pr/11_03.php
that software developers can now publish their works at Lulu.com
and sell hard copies of instruction manuals and boxed sets of
programs. This could be a boon to open source software developers
and customers alike, since fans cannot usually walk into their
local software store and pick up a copy of the latest open source
applications.

Ok, having installed the updated runtime modules, the Axiom
build from your original Windows sources is now will on it's
way to completion in the middle of compiling the algebra.
Thank you!

When this completes, I will start working with the
axiom--windows-1 arch sources. My first attempt to build
from these failed due to a compile error in bsdsignal.c.
I will check what is different between what is in your original
sources versus what is in axiom--windows-1. Perhaps those
patches got missed when Tim created the archive? I will
let you know if/when I submit new patches.

Dumb question from He Who Probably Missed the Email - is bookvol1 the
current Axiom - the 30 year horizon book, or just some smaller part of
it? (I assume from the page count it is just a part of it.)  If so, is
there any chance that someday one large, massive book could be made
available, for people like me who are likely to spend altogether too
much time wondering "now where did volume two go?"

Well, I guess the following might be my questions about something like
this:

a)  What is the cost per book without CD?  (As a probably irrelevant
side note, what would hardback cost? :-)

b)  Given the program can be downloaded in any case (and most likely a
more current version than that on a CD) how much will such a CD be
used?

c)  If people do desire CDs, what would be the cost of having some
printed, with nice art etc., and selling those off the website? 
Mightn't that be cheaper, and ultimately about as effective?  If
they're already willing to order the book online, one more form for the
CD, which we can stick right next to the link for the book, won't be
that much more trouble.  It would also allow people to get an
"official" CD by itself if they so desire.

d)  Thinking like a marketer for a second (ugh) who will be buying this
book?  OK, us, but we have all probably downloaded Axiom a gazillion
times anyway and are willing to compile our own cvs code.  Small
market, no CD demand.  General public?  Relatively unlikely.  Academics
doing research will have access to fast internet, so they aren't likely
to need a CD.  The one potential significant market I see (for some
definition of significant) is going to be the previously mentioned use
of the Axiom books as a course tool.  (Particularly the tutorial if the
split is made.)  For such a case, presumable the school would make an
order and some up front cash would be available to do the printing. 
Granted it might take several schools given the individual classes
probably won't be that big, but there they have a captive audience to
whom the content is relevant, and a CD is useful because the professor
can then say "this course is based off the version of the program on
the included CDROM."

Anyway - the idea of a CD is neat, but unless we expect to be stocked
in Barnes and Noble on the shelves I don't think we need to worry about
it up front.  An "official" cd is a good idea (I think the FSF sells
such CDs, actually) but I think at least initially we don't need to
have it included in the book.

Just my two (or three or four ;-) cents.

Hi Bill.

That's certainly a relief.

My AXIOM variable is:

Expect at least one failure in GCL due to a Makefile problem:

and later probably also because I haven't built 2.6.5 as patched in Axiom

I'm unsure about Tim's patch process at this stage but I'm sure you will be
able to incorporate the patch above somehow.

No worries.  I am being badly frustrated by arch at present.  If your
download stops (for example, last night my modem connection timed out during
the download after four hours and over thirty megabytes) you have to start
all over again because it does everything in a huge monolithic file.

4 hours and 30 Mb over a modem connection!? You must be desparate

Camm and I haven't discussed such a plan, but we are accumulating
alterations which would be made in such an event.  I would like very much to
get Axiom built with 2.6.5 on Windows before such a release was put

For Those-with-Quick-Deletekey-Finger there is always:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomBook

I am trying to keep this page reasonably up to date.

Yes, it is a smaller part - just an "Introduction and getting
started" sort of book.

At Lulu there is apparently a current limit of 700 pages.

Without the CD, the book is printed purely on demand. The
cost is just the price set by us minus the paper cost and
royalty percentage.

With the CD the price is also set by us but there is a
minimum print run of 100 copies which means that we have
to pay up front to produce those copies, but that the
cost would be fully recovered *if* we actually sold that
many (or more) copies.

> (As a probably irrelevant side note, what would hardback

I did not ask specifically for a quotation but from the
info on the Lulu web site I would say that the "upfront"
costs for a minimum print run are about the same. There
is also an additional charge for the cover stock.

That is a good question. However I think there is still
some considerable resistance for people to download 50 Mb.
of software. Many would rather stick a CD into their
machines.

The problem as I see it is the actual distribution. Are

Thanks. Your comments are appreciated.

My point of view right now is that it would be very
convenient if the Axiom Foundation had a tangible "boxed
product" to sell. Many people are reluctant to just give
a donation - even to a obviously worthy cause - but they
are none the less willing to purchase something like a
book or a CD at a price that includes some margin that
supports the activities that produce those products. It
seems to me that Lulu is a convenient way to do this.

Some organizations even resort to selling things like
t-shirts and coffee mugs ...

Please pardon my ignorance of the self installer process, but
what do you mean by "the build"? Is it the final .exe (about
50 Mb big) or is it just the script (small)? If it is the big
file, I can ask Tim Daly to setup a user id for you on
axiom-developer where you can do the upload. Otherwise if
small then email attachment to me. With a little hand-holding
I can probably figure out the rest of what to do with NULLSOFT.

As suggested in other emails, I would like to include the new
tm_axiom code and the axiom book (pdf) in the Windows installation
package.

How can we resolve the problem of how to enable TeXmacs for
Windows to find the tm_axiom plug-in? In the past these plug-ins
where distributed with TeXmacs but in this case I am quite sure
that the Axiom developers would prefer to maintain the plug-in
themselves. Perhaps there needs to be a mix of some plug-ins
supplied by TeXmacs and others supplied by the target programs.
Ideally one should be able install TeXmacs and Axion and either
order and still have the interface operational.

Forget that. There is no difference. The problem was just
that I set the AXIOM variable incorrectly. On windows
it must be:

export AXIOM=/home/bpage/axiom-build/mnt/windows
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

I think we gotta fix up ./configure so it at least says
the right thing (if not acutally doing the right thing :)

I will get back to that later today. So far the only
difference I can see is that last week I had not updated
to the latest versions of MinGW runtime 3.35 and Win32 3.1.
I have now done this and I will let you know the results

Wonderful. I was *very impressed* with the speed of Axiom
under Windows and I also have not found any peculiarities
in the output compared to Axiom on Linux. My first impression
is that Axiom on Windows is faster than Axiom under Linux on
the same hardware. But that seems improbable.  Perhaps it has
something to do with the changes in GCL head? Certainly the
combination of TeXmacs for Windows and Axiom is faster than
TeXmacs for Linux and Axiom for Linux but I think that has
to do with the threaded interface program.

I would be very happy to work with someone who knows Maxima
to produce a new native Windows tm_maxima. The version of
TeXmacs for Windows is still very new and only a few plug-ins
have been tested with it - most require a rewrite specifically
for windows because Windows process handling is different from
Linux. I think that example of threaded process handling that
Mike Thomas sent me is superior to the older TeXmacs interface
code (on Windows at least and possibly also under linux).

If someone volunteers to help with testing, I could probably
produce a first attempt at a tm_maxima by merging the new
process code with the conversions embedded in the old tm_maxima
for Linux. This might take a 1/2 day work.

About Maxima and TeXmacs for Windows, see:

http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2004/006925.html
http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2003/005702.html

This tutorial should be updated for the new native Windows
version:

http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~seidl/texmacs/tmtour.html

I am also mildly motivated to add Maxima support to MathAction
but so far only Bob McElrath has shown any direct interest
and unfortunately he has had other priorities and not
enough time.

I am very impressed by Dan Martin's work with porting TeXmacs
to windows. From the description at

http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/download/windows.en.html

I think it is currently rather undervalued by the original
TeXmacs developers perhaps because Windows is viewed as a
less desirable target platform by most open source
developers? But the reality is that the number of potential
windows users still far exceeds the number linux desktop
users. I think that it is interesting to see from the
MathAction web stats that in just 5 days, the new Windows
version of Axiom has already by downloaded more that 125
times!

> I just wish we had saveable worksheets for both CAS systems -
> TeXmacs seems not to be able to do that yet.

I am not sure I understand your comment. It is already
possible now to save a TeXmacs document that includes any
kind of session output (including Axiom) as if it was a
"worksheet". My only quibble with TeXmacs is that it currently
has no easy way to re-execute all of the session commands
embedded in a document with one click. One must visit each
command in the document and press Enter to cause it to be
re-executed.

Or do you mean simply that you cannot access Maxima from
TeXmacs for Windows? I think both the Cygwin and Linux
versions of TeXmacs can do this.

That's a cool idea. I think we need to give some thought to
how to package Axiom for Windows. As C Y (subject: crazy
idea) has pointed out, Windows users tend to have greater
expectations when in comes to the completeness. C Y's
"crazy idea" was that maybe we should include TeXmacs for
Windows together with the Axiom for Windows - assuming
that TeXmacs would be the preferred interface. Even if
we don't do that, then at least I think the Windows package
should include the tm_axiom interface and as you suggest,
the Axiom book.

Dan Martin has offered to provide a auto-install script
for Axiom for Windows using the Nullsoft installer system.

Is your PDF version of the book built with working internal
links? The method that I used most recently (dvipdfm under
Debian) did not produce working links.

Yes, this last; although I hadn't realised it was even possible by the
method you mention (What do I click on to do so?).

A worksheet to me is a live document where the state of the (in this case
Axiom, but also any other) system is accurately saved and restored and
separately saveable in a word processing format native to the particular
system.  Note that I realise I'm asking for an ideal state of affairs (see
your/Cliff's comments about Windows users below) rather than negatively
criticising the enormous amount of hard work which has made the current
offering what it is today.

<grin>

Tim, I think you have to "get out more"... :) One sees
exactly the same thing with Maxima. There are apparently
many more Windows users than Linux users. And sales of Maple
and Mathematica are also greatly dominated by Windows.

I think your question though: "who are these people" is a
good one. I would really like to know too. Unfortunately
it seems that in spite of all the systems that we have in
place to facilitate two-way communications over the web and
via email, the ratio of people who visit (and download) to
those who stop and talk is remarkably small. I used to think
that the ratio was at least 100:1 but lately the evidence
that I have from the Axiom project (and several other similar
things in which I am involved) is that it must be more like
1000:1.

Therefore, it seems to me that in order to find more people
interested in actively participating in Axiom development
we really have no choice but to push ahead with increasing
our exposure. Frankly a few hundred people subscribed to
axiom-developer is just not enough.

BTW, I would not be too surprized if the number of downloads
of the Windows version continued at this rate for a while
longer.

Thanks Bill.

My mistake.

I'm working now on another patch to deal with a call to GCL malloc from the
MinGW32 runtime before main() is called and there may yet be another one as
well dealing with a memory mapping bug.  Time (hopefully today) will tell.

When I send Tim the new patch(es) I'll include whatever else is needed to
execute and document those new patches in the Makefile as well.  Hopefully
at that point GCL 2.6.5 itself will be a clean build under gcc 3.4.2 and the
latest runtime and you can proceed with what is ultimately the more
important work for you - adding features to Windows Axiom.

No idea but I think at that stage the makefile is building a list of object

Subject: system::getenv does not return MSYS environment variables

Tim, Mike,

Doubly odd. When I went back to check my build.log for the last
compile I just noticed that

| The syntax of the command is incorrect.
| The syntax of the command is incorrect.

does not appear in the log that I captured with

  make | tee build.log

But if I repeat the make, then sure enough they do show up again,
presumably from stderr.

Comparing the contents of the log to the stanza
  ${INT}/algebra/dbcomplete:
in src/algebra/Makefile and noting the location of the marker
  4301 rebuilding databases ...
it seems to me that these syntax error messages must originate
during the call to the make-databases lisp function since
the Loading messages are generated by AXIOMsys and the message
"building browse.daase" is generated in make-databases.

In any case make-databases seems to be doing something that
Windows doesn't like. When I look at src/interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet
I see a lot of file manipulation like probe-file, namestring,
rename-file, delete-file, etc. But running as much of AXIOMsys
that got built (it kicks me into BOOT) I can tell that in spite
of the fact that probe-file returns a string starting with "c:/"
(a Windows convention that refers to a drive c), the rename-
file functions etc. do seem to work. However I note that I can
cause namestring to return the message "Cannot coerce NIL to
a PATHNAME" if I do something like (namestring (probe-file "xxx"))
when "xxx" doesn't exist.

Apparently at the point that that "Cannot coerce NIL ..." occurs
make-databases has successfully built the *.build files (I checked
that they do actually exist in int/algebra) and it is calling
(create-initializers) before doing the file renaming etc.

I don't clearly understand what create-initializers does, but
one thing seemed strange. The call to

  (|getEnv| "AXIOM")

returns NIL even though

  echo $AXIOM

shows that the environment variable is set. But stranger still is

  (|getEnv| "PATH")

does return the PATH in windows format (with ; ) while the

  echo $PATH

shows it correctly in unix format (with : ).

In cfuns.lisp I see

(deffun |getEnv| (varname) (system::getenv varname))

and it seems that (system::getenv "AXIOM") also returns
NIL. I think that is wrong!

One of the external lib/cfunc.c routines is copyEnvValue which
calls the stdlib routine getenv(). A simple test program shows
that this gets both AXIOM and PATH variables properly. But it is
apparently no longer used in Axiom. I wonder what GCL is calling
of system::getenv?

Anyway, that's about as far as I can get understanding this
error right now.

I don't think that this is worth it. If possible, I'd follow the suggestions
already given: 

* include a possibility of ordering a CD in the book and, more importantly,

* make it very easy to order a CD from the website.

I think that the CD will mostly serve people with a bad internet connection,
and I'm afraid that this is the case in some countries which may become very
important for Axiom: Russia, for example, many countries in Africa and probably
in South-America. Therefore I'd also suggest that both book and CD should cost
almost nothing. 

I believe that it would be quite possible to tell the people: pay as much as
you want to, but at least bla$, where bla$ is the actual cost.

I know of a community in France you can visit (nearly) any time you want -- a
very nice place. You can choose the amount you pay within a given range, which
depends on the country you come from. I.e., Austrians usually pay quite a lot
more than people from Hungary, but it might be that a rich Hungarian chooses to
pay more or as much as some poor Austrian. Of course, it is not possible to
control this, and in fact, there is no control. It just works. Seemingly: the
community exists already quite a long time, I think they started to invite
people in the early seventies.

The point I'm trying to make: maybe it would be wiser *not* to try to make any
money with the book, but rather try to make it as accessible as possible. I
suspect that this is the reason for the predominance of MS Windows, in fact.

I don't know if this is feasible. Is it possible to collect orders on the Axiom
website and then forward them to Lulu?

Ok, I said to myself: Why don't I give it a Windows AXIOM
environment variable using

  Start/Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environment Variable

My first attempt was to add

  AXIOM  c:\cvs\head\axiom\mnt\windows

Sure enough when I got into AXIOMsys (BOOT>) the result
I got from

  (|getEnv| "AXIOM")

was  c:\\cvs\\head\\axiom\\mnt\\windows

Well, that was almost ok, so I decided to change the
Windows environment variable to

  AXIOM  c:/cvs/head/axiom/mnt/windows

even though that is technically not a path in Windows. Note:
By experiment last week I discovered that this is actually
the format of the environment variable that works with Mike
Thomas's current binary version of AXIOM to get it to run
on windows if it is not located where it was originally built.

This now looks good in (|getEnv| "AXIOM") so I decided to
try make again. I was confused that in spite of setting the
AXIOM variable in Windows, I still had to set it again in
MSYS. The environment variables are copied but but the format
was wrong for the Axiom make. It expects the "MSYS" format

  export AXIOM=/c/cvs/head/axiom/mnt/windows

and the PATH set as usual. In spite of setting AXIOM in
MSYS like this, (|getEnv| "AXIOM") still returns the value
as set in Windows not MSYS!

Now when I do make instead of "syntax error" in the log I see:

'rm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
'sort' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

----
Better.

Could this be a problem with GCL (or somewhere in Axiom)
not using the .exe extension needed by windows? Both rm.exe
and sort.exe do exist in /bin

A quick grep shows that sort and rm occur in br-data.boot and
br-saturn.boot

Finally, I decide to set the Windows AXIOM environment variable
to

  AXIOM  /c/cvs/head/axiom/mnt/windows

(and restart MSYS)

Now the the make ends in

   Loading c:/cvs/head/axiom/mnt/windows/autoload/br-saturn.
 
   >> System error:
   Cannot rename the file #P"libdb.text" to #P"olibdb.text".

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

-------

libdb.text also occurs in br-saturn.boot

I think that is an improvement. At this point I think a
'make clean' and start again is in order since I now seem
to at least have the AXIOM environment variable properly
set.

I think the in GCL on windows this weirdness concerning
Windows environment variables versus MSYS environment
variables (needed during the build at least) may have to
be more carefully thought out.

Martin,

Thanks for your comments. Although I (mostly) express the
opposite view below, I think it is important that we
consider this from all sides.

Overall I am inclined to think that producing CD's either
separately or as part of a book package is probably not
currently worth the effort.

Who will actually ship these orders? Who will make the copies
of the CD? If we get 10 orders, ok no problem. But if there
were 100's or more, then that requires someone who commits to
doing this task in a reliable and timely manner.

In my experience that is not true. Most of the people I have
met in the countries you mention are quite used to downloading
software or obtaining copies from other sources. They are quite
used to not having easy access to boxed sofware from foriegn
sources. There are many complications like simply trying to
get something through customs brokers etc. But for (most) of
them, the Internet download is the fast track.

In my opinion CD's best serve those people who required some
tangible piece of hardware or physical book when then place
an order through a conventional institution (like a book
store). It is possible these days to download Maple and
Mathematica over the web and then pay via credit card to
receive a license that allows one to use the program after
the trial period expires. But as far as I know most people
and universitys still prefer to order and receive a boxed
set of CD's complete with a user's guide and other
documentation.

Yes, but it does complicate the institutional bookkeeping. :)

Could you explain that? MS Windows is almost always sold as
a boxed set and Microsoft certainly intends that it make money
through sales.

I don't think that setting a reasonable price on something
necessarily makes it less accessible. Afterall, everything
that is available at some set price in a boxed set of CD's
or a hardcopy book is also and always (by nature of the
BSD license) also available for free online. Really what
people are paying for is the package (and the privilege of
directly supporting the development through sales). This
is (more or less) the strategy that has been pursued by most
linux vendors such as RedHat and Suse.

Yes, that is possible. In fact it is encouraged by Lulu
since they provide several ways to interface to their
ordering system.

But if you are thinking about ordering CD's from Lulu
separately from a book, I am not so sure that Lulu provides
such a service. And if they did, I expect that there would
still be a requirement for a minimum production run. Perhaps
there is another company that is prepared to ship CD's in
smaller runs? But the cost, I expect is almost all in the
production, handling and shiping of the CD's. The only way
to do this at a lower cost is at some minimum level of mass
production.

Athough it does not directly answer your question, I think
the graph and the table here:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/usage/usage_200412.html#TOPCTRYS

which shows the breakdown of MathAction users by country is
quite interesting. For example it shows that the web site has
been accessed by people from at least 37 different countries
from the period Dec 1 to Dec 7. Last month (Nov) is was only
19 countries but 46 countries in October.

Of those countries so far this month, the majority of hits
from recognizable ip addresses are from the US commericial
category. It is also the next highest in total number of
kilobytes downloaded except for Italy (which is double at 18%).
Surprizingly perhaps US Educational is still quite low,
accounting for only 2% of the bandwidth. But compared to
numbers in previous months, it is increasing.

Of course one should take these statistics with a "pound
of caution" since they do not clearly separate out accesses
by search engines and other agressive agents on the web.

Subject: Last note for the evening on Axiom Windows development

Hi all.

One last thought for the evening...

There are a number of "system()" calls to Unix utilities for directory 
make/delete and file copy in "src/interp"  - this may explain 
directories not being made on Windows and *.daase files not being in place.

These functions should be replaced with C equivalents in 
cfun.c.pamphlet, not only for the lack of those utilities on Windows but 
also because the semantics of system() are different (no POSIX shell, 
file path expectations are different, no wildcard expansion by cmd.exe 
etc) so it is a comprehensively non-portable way to do things.

Just open an existing worksheet containing some session
(such as Axiom) and then click at the end of the line
containing the first Axiom command and press Enter. The
old output will be replaced with the new output. TeXmacs
(usually) places the cursor at the end of the next line.
So all you have to do is press Enter again. Except at
the end of a sequence of commands broken by some non-
executable text. In that case it opens a new prompt. To
skip to the next command you can press down-arrow.

Yes I agree completely. It should be essentially like
an OpenOffice calc spreadsheet. But most people settle
for something less. This brings back an arguement that
I had long ago with the Maple designers. I told them
that there user interface as "not really a worksheet"
and I compared it to visicalc (at least I think that as
the paradigm at the time). I explained that it should not
be possible for the contents of the worksheet to be
inconsistent with the state of the "calculation engine".
A little while later Maple came out with a new "feature"
which was symbolic formulas arranged in a tabular format
and they called that a spreadsheet interface. As far as
I know it is little used in Maple and from my point of
view it still completely misses the point.

Anyway everyone is used by now to having to re-execute
the entire document after inserting and editing formulas
within the a document in order to ensure the consistency
of the content of the document with the calculation being
performed in the order implied by the physical organization
of the document. Maple even has a single button now that
does this re-execution in one step. That is, I guess what
I would like to have in TeXmacs. Joris has told me that if
I knew enough about writing scheme code for TeXmacs that
this would be easy. :)

Well, in my experience, MS DOS and MS Windows were de facto free for
everybody. I don't know anybody who actually paid for it (privately), except
through buying a computer where it is already pre-installed. But I'm quite sure
that those who acquired MS Windows by buying a computer would be aware of the
fact that they actually paid for it.

And, it was always policy of MS to give away copies of MS Windows, MS Office
etc. for free or little cost to schools and universities.

They are making money by hooking people onto their products, thus making
business buy them.

If the "hooking" part doesn't imply the "money" part, I don't see a problem.

Hmm, that's an interesting idea.  To answer the earlier question (a

Subject: Re: GCL and valgrind

Hi Tim!  And thank you so much for the introduction to valgrind!

The code indicated is in the garbage collector.  You can trigger the
same running ordinary gcl under valgrind by invoking (gbc t).  When
gcl is built with debugging, source line numbers are also printed, and
when valgrind is run with --db-attach=yes, one can step into the
debugger at the point in question.  Very useful.

Unfortunately, I'm not really sure what can be done about this.  GCL's
garbage collection algorithm is 'conservative', at least with respect
to the C stack.  What this means is that the C stack is walked looking
for potential lisp objects, which are marked when found.  The origin
of this walk is the address of the argc argument to main() -- the
endpoint is the address of a dummy local variable in the top stack
frame (i.e. that of the current function).  Normally, the assembler
code output by gcc fills in the stack continuously by pushing normal
word-sized arguments with each function call.  Apparently situations
can also arise where the stack pointer is incremented by a larger
amount in one step, presumably to achieve certain alignment, leaving
an uninitialized 'hole' in the active stack region.  These situations
appear to be quite rare (given the size of the stack traversed in this
algorithm).  

I'm still looking into this to see if I can recognize where and why
the stack is differently initialized at these points.  But broadly
speaking, the 'conservative' algorithm makes no assumptions about the
contents of the stack at all, and takes the cautious point of view
that if there is anything that looks like an object pointer that could
be stored in a local variable in any frame above the present one, that
it should be marked regardless of whether this is an accidental
situation or not.  More specifically, there is no way (that I know of
at least) to distinguish between initialized stack and 'holes', nor is
there any way within C to ensure that the stack is contiguous.  One
might attempt something very ugly and quite unworkable, to store the
last address of the caller which would be compared with the first
address of the callee at every function call, doing a memset if there
was a gap.  Needless to say this is fraught with peril an highly
unportable.  There might be some gcc/gas switches which could help
too.  Its worth looking at for a bit.  But I just wanted to say that
these messages do not point to an error in the implementation of the
algorithm.  This is the way the algorithm is supposed to work,
processing possibly random uninitialized junk, but marking any object in
the heap possibly pointed to just to be safe.

Take care,

When building gmp locally, we copy and rename the object modules into
unixport/gmp in such a manner as to avoid namespace conflicts.  The
sed strips '../' from the path and then replaces '/' with '_'.

There are some performance enhancements in 2.7.0, but I would have
thought you would not be likely to see them.  If you do discover any
performance differences between 2.6.5 and head, I'd be most

Mike and I were discussing this a while ago.  We were trying to decide
if the community of Windows users was likely to be more user oriented
and less contributor oriented.  It would be interesting to know what
experience you accumulate here.  I suppose Linux is somewhat of an
exception, as it *only* exists because of its user/contributors, so we
may be somewhat spoiled by this example.

This is just a wrapper around the C library getenv.  Does this not

Mostly by historical accident, we also ship axiom on Debian using

The workaround is in the lisp file.  I've attached the C file in case I've
missed something.  In the light of the stuff I mentioned late last night and
also some further tests I did I'm still not happy with this but for the time
being the patch works - when I have some more time I'll go further into it.

Bill,

It could depend on how you are launching the program.
If you launch main.c using an icon and launch your
test program by an MSYS shell command they could be
running in different environments.

Try running AXIOMsys from a shell command and then ask for the
value of the environment variables using the )lisp axiom command
and the )sys axiom command and see if they differ.

This seems sensible to me as, additionally, there are still some alterations
in the toplevel makefile eg "pwd -W" which I am assuming don't work on other
platforms and which would need to be handled in a system specific manner at
that level.

With regard to that issue, can we assume that the Axiom build will only
support GNU make or do you plan to be more portable with regard build
support tools (other than the Lisp compiler which you have discussed
elsewhere)?

Subject: RE: system::getenv does not return MSYS environment variables

Hi Bill.

I suspect something is wrong at your end, I have no troubles reading either
MSYS or Windows environment variables (I believe the build would not work if
this were not the case):

====================================================
(1) -> )lisp (si::getenv "HISTFILE")

Value = "C:/msys/1.0/home/miketh/.bash_history"
(1) -> )lisp (si::getenv "PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE")

Value = "x86"

====================================================

The above example was running within an MSYS shell.

Is it possible you were expecting an Axiom system launched separately from
an MSYS shell to see the environment variables in a separate MSYS shell?

This won't work as manipulation by one process of it's own environment (Eg
an MSYS Bash shell setting the HISTFILE variable) does not affect the local
environment's of processes running separately from that first process (eg.
MS Word launched from the Windows start menu.)

like the tests are OK on Windows but there are so many it is difficult to be
certain by eyeball.

Yes I see the code in main.c that implements system::getenv.
I am at a complete loss to explain following since apparently
both copyEnvValue.c in Axiom's lib/cfun-c.c *and* system::getenv
both call getenv from <stdlib>. Are there two different stdlib's??

What is observe is the following::

1) In Windows I go

     Start/Control Panel/System/Advanced/Enviroment Variables

   and I set an environment variable, say

     W1 c:/xxx/yyy

2) Then I start an MSYS shell. I can see the environment variable
   W1 from the shell

     echo $W1
     c:/xxx/yyy

3) Set another environment variable here in MSYS

     export M1=d:/www/zzz
     echo $M1
     d:/www/zzz

4) Start GCL (in my case it was AXIOMsys) and interrogate
   the environment variables

   (system::getenv "W1")
   "c:/xxx/yyy"

   (system::getenv "M1")
    NIL

   GCL doesn't see the MSYS environment variable.

 5) Write a simple C program that calls getenv directly

    # test.c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    main () {
      fprintf(stdout,"W1=%s\n",getenv("W1"));
      fprintf(stdout,"M1=%s\n",getenv("M1"));
    }

    gcc test.c -o test
    test
    W1=c:/xxx/yyy
    M1=d:/www/zzz

    In this case the program sees both environment
    variables.

 6) Can you guess what happens if we use the same
    environment variable names in both Windows and
    in MSYS?

Hopefully axiom will build on every system with the minimum of changes.
Originally axiom used vanilla make but there were some features of gmake
that made it easier to use (e.g. the shell command). From my point of
view it would be better if everything was in common lisp as it makes
porting so much easier. I've had some discussions about moving the
C code portions (such as sockets and the X into CLX). I find it
incredibly tedious to port C code. The MACOSX and BSD ports of working
C code stumble over the fact that each system seems to have a need to
change the tree of includes. So portability is one of the key issues.
The less C code, the less we depend on special features of tools, the
easier life will be.

Mike,

The tests do ')set message test on'

If a test fails it prints out:

Daly bug:

so do

cd int/input
fgrep Daly *.output | uniq

and you'll see which tests fail. Some of these failures have been
there since the code was shipped to NAG so it is not necessarily
the case that they have been introduced locally.

Not surprising given the flurry of emails.

There is a long standing problem that on Windows you have to copy by hand
the daase files by hand half way through the build:

   cp src/share/algebra/*.daase int/algebra/

This may be related to the issue mentioned here last night:

   http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-12/msg00117.htm
l

which I have yet to look into.

One thing I forgot to mention in that email is that I have also noticed in
the past hard wired Unix paths in the Makefiles some of which I fixed but
not yet pervasively.

There is a second daase problem (recent) in that the arch archive for
Windows either downloaded onto my machine incorrectly or else is completely
missing the src/share directory (tla is not working very well for me).

This is the native windows version of Axiom where I see
the problm (I am not yet sure about other versions). Your
point about fonts is good because I think by default the
native Windows version installs with fewer fonts. I do
however also have miktex installed on the same machine.
Do I have to do anything in particular to make sure that
TeXmacs sees and makes use of the MikTeX fonts? How can
I check if I "have all the necessary fonts"?

I am not sure I understand your question abouot "math-mode".
The symbols appear in the output generated by an Axiom
session. Other mathematical notations appear normally such
as large integral signs etc.

Is it ok if I send you an example file that includes

If so, perhaps there is a simple way to include it in the

Subject: \left( and \right) conversions from LaTeX
Cc: Dan Martins

TeXmacs developers;

The Axiom developers plan to distribute a new version of
tm_axiom plug-in together with open source Axiom as an
officially supported interface for TeXmacs. Currently we
have a beta test version of this interface for Windows that
uses an efficient threaded technique for the interprocess
communication. A linux version will follow. I am currently
extending this new plug-in to include the Axiom tex output
line-breaker algorithm. I have integrated the same code
that I used on MathAction and it seems to be working well.
It successfully wraps example expressions like

  (x+y+z)^10

and

  (1/x+y+z)^10

But by default the line-breaker code writes left and right
parenthesis, as LaTeX expandable \lefth( and \right) symbols.
Unfortunately TeXmacs (at least the native Windows version)
no longer seems to translate these correctly. (I was sure
that this used to work in previous versions of TeXmacs.)
What I see in TeXmacs is literally

  <left-(-1> and <right-)-1> 

instead of the acutal parenthesis. As I understand it, these
codes are intended to display as larger parenthesis of some
fixed size. However these are now displayed only as formating
codes exactly as as shown above but highlighted in red - not
as actual parenthesis.

So I see two problems.

 1) The conversion form LaTeX \left( and \right) should
    really just be to TeXmacs \left( and \right( . Note:
    TeXmacs \left( and \right) seem to work fine when
    entered at the keyboard. Is there some way I can
    configure TeXmacs to do this conversion from LaTeX?

 2) Why aren't the <left-(-1> and right codes displayed
    as actual parenthesis? Just for interest sake, I
    would like to know how to enter these things at the
    keyboard.

Until this is resolved, it is easy for me to convert the
\left( and \right) symbols to just ( and ). But of course
this does look nearly as nice for complex highly folded
mathematics.

Is this a known problem? Or have I misunderstood something
about how LaTeX to TeXmacs is supposed to work?

At IBM I incorporated automated regression testing into the makefiles.
I've yet to recover that facility but the "Daly Bug" message is part
of it. Some of the files have deliberate errors in them (demonstrating
"correct" failure cases) so the )set message test option allows the
regression software to distinguish the failures. (The "Daly Bug"
message was so named because I needed a unique string and since I
was the only one who would ever see the test results I used my name.
Apparently once IBM sold it NAG never changed it).

If you check out the src/input/Makefile.dvi you'll see that there are
other cases that do not run. In particular, the graphics test cases
do not yet run and I'm working on getting them running as I write this.
Running these cases requires sman to work properly and that only 
came into the build a few weeks ago.

Once the regression testing works we'll have a baseline of failures.
If you look at the src/input/bugs.input.pamphlet file you'll see
that I used to keep track of reported bugs, with failing examples,
as well as fixes. These were kept around to ensure that they continued
to work and that reported bug test cases were not lost.

So, the answer to your question is that, yes, we can do that and it
should happen in the near future but in a more generally useful way.
I will add both failure lists (unix and windows) to the README file
on savannah at the next push.


Also of note is that I've collected the test suites from other computer
algebra systems and plan to apply them to axiom. However I'd like to 
generalize the test suites so that they can be used by many systems
in addition to axiom. The long term win here is that we can all benefit
from a "standardized test suite" where the mathematics and the known
answers are supplied as well as the test cases. I've christened this
testing effort CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite). In the long term
I want axiom to run all the standardized tests in CATS. The CATS
branch was on the previous arch server but I have yet to recreate
that branch here. If there is any interest in developing better
testing I'll do it now.

The challenge, of course, is to write the mathematics behind the
tests into pamphlet files so the tests are properly documented
and can be used with some confidence that the answer is correct.

Yes, I understand. But I am runing AXIOMsys only from
within the MSYS shell the way we must during the build.

I just spent the last 3 hours worrying that all of this
was not reproducible and that I must have just been
going crazy last night. Now I know that it is only hard
to reproduce. My first attempt to do the equivalent of
what you suggested above actually worked (contrary to
my previous email and my emails of last night). The
short story is that I can now reproduce this problem by
attempting to build the database files several times
while trying variations ( ':' '\' and '/' ) of the AXIOM
variable in Windows.

The long story follows:

I could not do exactly what you suggest above because
I am not working with a complete build of AXIOM. I am
working with Mike's original /cvs/head/axiom build. I am
specifically looking at the database build problem. Until
Mike's work last night we did not have a 2.6.5 version
that built all the way up to the database problem. 
I have not yet tried to install all of Mike's changes
to the 2.6.5 build but I will likely shift this work
over to 2.6.5 once I can get it that far.

Anyway, my procedure is to run Mike's /cvs/head version up
to the point where it fails in make-databases. I detailed
what I was doing in several emails last night. If you wade
through that (something I just finished doing) you will
see that I isolated the "syntax error" messages as occurring
during the execution of the make-databases function.

AXIONsys is actually built but the database files are still
missing from mnt. They can actually be found in int but
they have not been renamed.

It is possible to start AXIOMsys anyway but it bails out
into the BOOT> prompt which where I can start executing
lisp commands. That is where is am doing my tests. Last
night tried to see what was going on in make-databases
and experimented with several file access commands like
probe-file and namestring. At least one of the failure
messages probably occurs when namestring is called to
convert a NIL. That's when I tried (|getEnv| "AXIOM") which
is used in one place to construct part of a file name. It
just calls system::getenv in turn.

I discovered that I could not longer get the AXIOM
environment variable using |getEnv| nor system::getenv. But
that outside of AXIOMsys, echo $AXIOM as fine. And my test
program (see previous message) also was fine. Every time
I tried to use system:getenv for the AXIOM variable it
failed. But the PATH variable was retrieved just fine.

That is all I knew until Camm asked about my report
tonight. I wrote up exact the test that I had done the
night before. But when you asked me to do a few more
tests, I found that the failure no longer occurred. Of
course in the mean time the machine on which I had been
working had been powered down and rebooted...

So what exactly did I do to reproduce the problem again?
I just did a 'make clean' and ran the build up to the
make-databases failure again. Then I started reading my
notes from last night (something I was reminded to do from
Mike's recent comments :) and followed the same steps of
setting the AXIOM variable in Windows before starting MSYS.
Re-running the build caused the "syntax errors" to change
to "rm not found" just like I reported last night. As Mike
noted, system commands like "rm" and "sort" occur in some
of the boot code that is used during the make-databases
function.

But here is where it gets weird. Doing the above also subtly
screws up the Windows environment. Now I was suddenly unable
to retrieve the value of the PATH variable this time
using system:getenv and several attempts and stopping the
MSYS shell checking Windows and restarting MSYS only made
this worse. Other environment variables started disappearing.
Right now the system is about back in the state is was last
night. Even logging out and back into Windows doesn't cure
the problem. (I fully expect that a full reboot a would :)

So, what have a learned: One thing, I guess is that compiling
AXIOM under GCL can really subtly mess up the Windows memory
management!

I also looked at the GCL code for getenv in main.c and I
noticed a scary section involving a call to free on the
pointer returned by the system getenv call. I imagine that
would really mess up Windows memory - but as far as I can
tell that option is not used during the Windows build.
Right?

I agree with Mike that we should focus on removing the
non-portable code from bootsys (and maybe elsewhere too?)
although I don't have any direct evidence that the problem
I am seeing with environment variables is necessarily
related those non-portable functions but they do appear at
about the same time. I rather suspect that it is some Windows
memory corruption that is the "first cause" of the failure
and these other commands are not really the problem. Perhaps
changing the Windows environment variables just allows the
process to go a little further. But they are probably easier
to fix than memory.

It is quire remarkable then that simply copying in new
database files and continuing actually allows the build
to complete. So far I have not seen any evidence of any
memory management problems in the running Axiom build
that I extracted from Mike's original cvs/head build, but
then I have not actually tried any commands that manipulate
files.

I apologize that this email once again has got so long.

Bill,

First, you're doing a great job on the debugging front.
Somebody has to collect the clues.

Second, we do need to collect and document all of the system
dependent code into a new src/interp/lisp file because these
will come up again at every port effort. In particular we
should have several sections of the pamphlet file:

file commands
  rm vs erase functionality
  mv vs move 

path naming issues
  / vs \
  / vs c:

system services
  getenv
  sockets
  X

lisp system commands
  system
  save-system
  
We can write cover functions and then #+ for each system.
Perhaps we can do this effort in the axiom--windows--1 branch as
that is where most of them will show up. Well, the lisp system
commands and sockets are likely to show up in the sbcl branch.

I'll create a file there and look at moving some functions to it.

Third, do you know about the DAASE shell variable? If you set this
variable axiom will use it to look for databases. Unfortunately I
don't remember what the exact issue is. All I can remember is a
report that the newly built databases did not work on some platform
but I dropped the ball somewhere chasing that one.

Great idea! Yes, I think doing this for Windows would be
especially useful and a good place to start.

Yes, it also occurs along with the AXIOM variable in the
same section of the src/interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet file that
I have been looking at. It's use appears to be option for
a possible non-standard location of the daase files. It
has no assigned value in the current build.

The database structure looks quite complicated to me
since it includes lots of reference to external files etc.
Maybe in some cases or some non-standard file structures
(this used to be more common than today) some parts of these
file names had to be modified by the use of this DAASE shell
variable?

Do you have a problem report tucked away somewhere? If so,
maybe I can keep it in mind as I look at this code.

Yes, you are right. It apparently takes some special
effort to create the situation where the failure starts
to occur. (See previous message.)

No I understand that MSYS is a sub-process running under
windows.

But as I am quite sure you are aware, Windows memory
protection is quite a bit "softer" than under Linux. It is
quite easy (especially on older versions of windows) for
one miss-behaving process to step on the memory of other
processes or even the operating system. When I am feeling
generous to the Windows OS designers (not often), I might
claim that this is the price one pays for focusing on
"open" threaded processes for speed versus the security
and greater overhead of the Unix OS design. Hardware
advances have made it all moot anyway, but Windows still
has some of the original legacy.

Some of the things that I hear about that GCL apparently
does in memory really scares me when I think about Windows ...
that's when I feel like it's purely amazing that any of this
works at all! :)) I think the extraordinary skills of the
GCL developers (you included) are absolutely essential to
this success.

Tim,

>From what I have seen, the following should give you
a list to start:

$ cd src/interp
$ grep -i 'obey' *.boot.* *.lisp.*
$ grep -i '(system ' *.boot.* *.lisp.*

These problems all have to do with the fact that (system
calls windows command.com which is a very limite and non-
unix-like shell (MSDOS). I notice that some other platforms
use their own replacement shell programs. This is possibility
for windows too. There are some good open source possibly
even posix compliant shells for windows that Axiom could
just incorporate for use in Windows. But then, maybe it is
best just to avoid this and call lisp functions directly -
surely that would be more efficient then loading a shell.

Up until this point it was not possible to test the input files
which include the draw function calls since these required sman.
Now that sman and graphics work we can start testing these functions.

I've modified the src/input/Makefile.pamphlet so that it will invoke
sman rather than axiom for testing the files which include the draw
functions. At present it is only one input file (wiggle.input).
During the build process you will see graphs appear and disappear.
I'll be adding more input test files as soon as I can.

This will clearly be a problem with the various ports as we are 
not yet able to run graphics. However this change will not affect
the port branches.

I'll be running a full system test of axiom--main--1 overnight.

Cc: Dan Martins, Bill Page

Joris,

I have found that if I edit the document tree and replace
<with|mathdisplay|true| ... > by <with|mode|math| ... >
then the parenthesis are displayed properly. The only way
I found this was by manually entering a formula that uses
such parenthese and then locating it in the document tree.
All I did was change the result of the LaTeX conversion to
the same thing and it works. (but this editing is tedious).

This suggests to me that the LaTeX conversion to TeXmacs
form must be wrong.

I don't understand the difference between

<with|mathdisplay|true| ... > and <with|mode|math| ... >

could you explain?

Mike,

That's great news. It will be nice to put this part of the
project "to bed" ...

The Makefile.pamphlet file that you attached did not contain
a <<windows>> section. Does this file have to be merged with
the existing one or is it the wrong file?

Thanks.

You mean "math-display" instead of "mathdisplay"? This corresponds to
display style in TeX/LaTeX. The second one selects math mode.
So the parentheses indeed do not seem to be in math mode for some reason.

Can you send a simple LaTeX fragment which was not correctly converted
according to you?

I think we need a 4th volume of the axiom book written by and for 
developers. We need to document the internals, the build method,
the various tweaks and tricks that are possible, methods of writing
tests, how to add new directories, porting issues, documentation
standards, beginners guides, etc.

I'll make a stab at an outline and upload it later today to

Thanks Joris.

Attached are two files. One is LaTeX generated by Axiom and
the line-breaker filter interface (TeXmacs communication
protocol mark-up removed and wrapped in standard LaTeX
document preamble. It compiles nicely in LaTeX to a pdf file
(I can it too if you like).

The other is a TeXmacs document containing the imported LaTeX
(also looks real nice!) and then exactly the same thing as
an Axiom session with the same interface with line-breaker
filter, showing the tags displayed instead of actual parenthesis.

Bill Page.

I solved the problem adding:

XLIB=/usr/X11R6/lib64

to the `fedora64' section (I build on Mandrake 9.1 and it has `libXpm.a'
in `/usr/X11R6/lib64'). The `LDF' variable did propagate correctly ...

Now axiom (and graphics!!) works OK.

Subject: State of play with GCL 2.6.5 on Windows

Hi again.

What a chase - the algebra is now compiling with GCL 2.6.5 on Windows; who
knows what lies ahead, but it's probably OK.  Apart from:

 1. the crashing "tla",

 2. the absence of the "src/share" directory from "axiom--windows--1" (or at
least the copy I managed to download via HTTP repository tla),

 3. a new kind of crash compiling AHYP, and

 4. a total of 4 new Axiom source tree GCL patches to backport CVS HEAD
changes for gcc 3.4.2 and latest libraries to GCL 2.6.5,

everything went OK.

Item 3, the 2.6.5 AHYP crash cause was in the cfun.c.pamphlet DIRECTORYP,
this had a bug on Windows now hopefully fixed.  I had to remove
ensure-directory-exists from src/interp/nlib.lisp.pamphlet as it was
apparently not present in 2.6.5.  Hopefully everything is still OK for the
CVS HEAD GCL build.

Four new patches and those modified files I can remember are attached for
Tim to incorporate into his arch/CVS complex non-linear system so that
current state on Windows can be recorded for posterity.  This is due to the
aforementioned tla problems on Windows.

Fingers crossed and hope to rest

Mike Thomas

\section{The Makefile}
We create a dummy file {\bf gcldir} after gcl has been built so
it is not rebuilt. We need to do this because we have no control
over the gcl Makefiles.

Patches are applied to the distribution before we do the configure.
\section{Gnu Common Lisp 2.6.5}
\subsection{gmp wrappers patch}
The file [[gmp_wrappers.h]] has the declaration of the integer [[j]]
out of order. This causes the compiler to complain. This patch puts
the declaration at the beginning of the function.
<<gcl-2.6.5.h.gmp_wrappers.h.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 28 applying gmp_wrappers patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.gmp_wrappers.h.patch )
@
\section{Gnu Common Lisp 2.5.2}
\subsubsection{socket patch}
This patch is to {\bf h/386-linux.defs} to include two 
global variables, {\bf EXTRAS} and {\bf EXTRA\_LIB}
\begin{verbatim}
EXTRAS = ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.o
EXTRA_LIB=${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/libspad.a
\end{verbatim}
The {\bf EXTRAS} variable is used to include two files into the
running image. The {\bf cfuns-c} file contains low-level directory
manipulation routines. The {\bf sockio-c} file contains low level
socket code. Note that versions of GCL beyond gcl-2.4.1 may have
routines already available. If so the Axiom references to these
routines should be rewritten.

We also need to create two .ini files, one for cfuns-c and one
for sockio-c. These are referenced in the gcl-2.4.1 makefiles
but, since no initialization is needed, we simply create empty files.

\subsubsection{fortran patch}
Communication over sockets (basically to the NAG fortran library)
requires us to have XDR enabled.
<<gcl-2.5.2.fortran.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 5 applying HAVE_XDR patch to h/linux.h ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.h.patch )
@
This patch is no longer necessary as of GCL-2.6.1 because the 
C preparser symbol HAVE_XDR is now the default in GCL.
\subsubsection{libspad patch}
The second patch changes the {\bf unixport/makefile} to reference
the {\bf libspad.a} library when building the raw system image.
from {\bf libspad.a}
<<gcl-2.5.2.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.1.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2a.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
\subsubsection{toploop patch}
This patch turns off the banner display every time GCL starts.
We could use the -batch flag but that would be a pervasive change.
It isn't critical to the system builds but we will later be 
capturing stdin and stdout and we do not want extra information
printed.
<<gcl-2.5.2.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.1.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2a.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
\subsubsection{object to float patch}
GCL 2.5.2 contains no reference to this function and it was removed.
Axiom uses this function so we re-implement it here.
<<gcl-2.5.2.objecttofloat.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 8 applying object_to_float patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.cmpaux.c.patch )
@
This patch is no longer necessary as of GCL-2.6.1 because object_to_float
is now defined by default.
\subsubsection{in-package patch}
This changes the common lisp 2.0 defined behavior of in-package
(throw an error if the package does not exist) so that it mirrors
the 1.0 defined behavior (create the package if it does not exist).
This patch is intended to be temporary. Axiom's common lisp code
should be fixed and this patch removed before shipment.
<<gcl-2.5.2.in-package.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 9 applying in-package patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.package.d.patch )
@
I believe that all instances of in-package have been fixed and 
that this patch is no longer necessary.
\subsubsection{EXIT and MAX\_STACK\_SIZE patchs}
Axiom uses EXIT as a function. GCL 2.5.2 decided to make it a 
synonym to the BYE function. We fix this for Axiom.
We also patch the MAX_STACK_SIZE to be 16Mb.
<<gcl-2.5.2.exit.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 10 applying EXIT patch ; \
	  echo 18 applying MAX_STACK_SIZE patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.main.c.patch )
@
As of GCL-2.6.1 EXIT is no longer defined.
<<gcl-2.6.1.exit.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 18 applying MAX_STACK_SIZE patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.main.c.patch )
@
As of GCL-2.6.1 EXIT is no longer defined.
<<gcl-2.6.2.exit.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 18 applying MAX_STACK_SIZE patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.main.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{tail-recursive patch}
Bill Schelter added tail recursion for Axiom. In order to test it
he left code in the system to print a message when the code was
executed. We no longer care but it is still in GCL. We patch the
call rather than the cmpnote function as cmpnote might have later
usage.
<<gcl-2.5.2.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
GCL 2.6.1 renamed the files.
<<gcl-2.6.1.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpflet.lsp.patch )

	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MSYS shell makefile variable patch}
This patch works around a bug in the MSYS make when executing
shell commands.
<<gcl-2.6.5.windows.variable.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 13 applying Windows shell variable patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.1.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MinGW32 gcc 3.4.2 and MinGW32 runtime 3.5 malloc patch}
This patch works around a bug in the MinGW32 runtime which calls malloc
before main - which intrun calls GCL's malloc which has not been =
initialised.
<<gcl-2.6.5.alloc.c.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 14 applying MinGW32 malloc before main workaround to o/alloc.c ; =
\
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.alloc.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MinGW32 directory wildcard patch}
Wildcards were not being passed through - truename not required here.
<<gcl-2.6.5.mingfile.c.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 15 applying MinGW32 directory wildcard patch to o/mingfile.c ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.mingfile.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{collectfn fix}
GCL-2.6.1 renamed collectfn.lsp to gcl_collectfn.lsp.
We rename it back into place because we have later Makefiles
that depend on it. The alternative is to propagate the name changes thru
all of those Makefile and they would now need to know about the =
GCLVERSION
variable. 
<<gcl-2.6.1.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/collectfn.lsp )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/collectfn.lsp )
@
In this version we have created a new subdirectory for use by GCL
during compile time at [[obj/sys/lsp]]. We copy two files from 
GCL, the [[collectfn.lsp]] file and the [[sys-proclaim.lisp]] file. 
The collectfn.lsp contains code which extends the GCL compiler and
collects type information. The compile-file function writes this
type information to a [[.fn]] file as structs. These structs can
be loaded and written out as a file of lisp proclaims. The =
sys-proclaim.lisp
file contains the proclaims for GCL's function definitions.
<<gcl-2.6.2a.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/lsp ; \
	  echo 27 copy sys-proclaim.lisp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp =
; \
	  cp sys-proclaim.lisp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/lsp ; \
	  echo 27 copy sys-proclaim.lisp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp =
; \
	  cp sys-proclaim.lisp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \

	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/lsp ; \
	  echo 27 copy sys-proclaim.lisp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp =
; \
	  cp sys-proclaim.lisp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp )
@
\subsection{The GCL-2.5.2 stanza}
\subsubsection{Configure and Make GCL}
We enable several features of GCL. 
The [[--enable-readline]] uses GNU readline for the prompts. It has been
removed and replaced with clef which is Axiom's version of readline.
The [[--enable-maxpage]] is set to allow the image to grow 4 times what =
it would by default. 
The [[--enable-vssize]] allows virtual stack to grow by twice the normal =
size. 
The [[--enable-statsysbfd]] uses a static system bfd library for loading =
and
relocating object files.
 
Finally we load some routines for performance reasons. =
[[lsp/sys-proclaim]]
contains common lisp proclaim statements for the various GCL lisp =
routines.
[[cmpnew/gcl_collectfn]] contains modifications to the common lisp =
compiler
to collect compile-time type information which will be written to [[.fn]]
files as common lisp structs. These [[.fn]] files can be loaded and =
turned
into common lisp proclaim statements which the compiler can use to =
generate
faster code, mostly fast-path function calls. The call to =
[[compiler::emit-fn]]
enables the [[.fn]] file generation whenever compile-file is called. We
default this code into the image so it is always avaiable.
<<gclConfigureMake>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION} ; \
	./configure ${LISPCFG} ; \
	${ENV} ${MAKE} ; \
	echo '(progn (load "cmpnew/gcl_collectfn.lsp") (load =
"lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp") (compiler::emit-fn t) (system::save-system =
"${OUT}/lisp"))' | unixport/saved_gcl )
@
GCL 2.5.2 changes are due to David Mentre (david.mentre@wanadoo.fr).
The key problem to solve is that 2.5.2 uses the common lisp 2.0 standard.
In Common Lisp 1.0 if you do (in-package 'foo) and the foo package does
not exist it is created. In Common Lisp 2.0 if you do (in-package 'foo) 
and the foo package does not exist it is an error. The file 
``gcl-2.5.2/o/package.d'' has been changed to keep the old behavior.
This is an incorrect fix in the long term. Axiom should be changed
everywhere to conform to the common lisp 2.0 standard. 

GCL 2.5.2 requires a different Makefile. In particular, GCL 2.5.2
has a different method of building the lisp image. And, just to
keep us on our toes, they've renamed the files we need to patch.
The new patches are in the zips directory. Patches now are prefixed
by GCLVERSION. 

This stanza will be written out when the GCLVERSION variable is
``gcl-2.5.2''. It will overwrite the default version. See the 
top level Makefile.pamphlet.

GCL-2.6.2a has a variable si::*optimize-maximum-pages* which defaults
to t which eliminates an old problem of spinning the gc for temporary

quite large size.  You might want to investigate (time ..) and (room)
on computationally intensive jobs with and without this variable set.

\section{Gnu Common Lisp 2.5}
GCL 2.5 requires a different Makefile. In particular, GCL 2.5
has a different method of building the lisp image. And, just to
keep us on our toes, they've renamed the files we need to patch.
The new patches are in the zips directory. Patches now are prefixed
by GCLVERSION. 
\subsubsection{socket patch}
This patch is to {\bf h/386-linux.defs} to include two 
global variables, {\bf EXTRAS} and {\bf EXTRA\_LIB}
\begin{verbatim}
EXTRAS = ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.o
EXTRA_LIB=${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/libspad.a
\end{verbatim}
The {\bf EXTRAS} variable is used to include two files into the
running image. The {\bf cfuns-c} file contains low-level directory
manipulation routines. The {\bf sockio-c} file contains low level
socket code. Note that versions of GCL beyond gcl-2.4.1 may have
routines already available. If so the Axiom references to these
routines should be rewritten.

We also need to create two .ini files, one for cfuns-c and one
for sockio-c. These are referenced in the gcl-2.4.1 makefiles
but, since no initialization is needed, we simply create empty files.
<<gcl-2.5.socket.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.ini ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.ini )
@ 
\subsubsection{fortran patch}
Communication over sockets (basically to the NAG fortran library)
requires us to have XDR enabled.
<<gcl-2.5.fortran.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 5 applying HAVE_XDR patch to h/linux.h ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.h.patch )
@
\subsubsection{libspad patch}
The second patch changes the {\bf unixport/makefile} to reference
the {\bf libspad.a} library when building the raw system image.
from {\bf libspad.a}
<<gcl-2.5.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
\subsubsection{toploop patch}
This patch turns off the banner display every time GCL starts.
We could use the -batch flag but that would be a pervasive change.
It isn't critical to the system builds but we will later be 
capturing stdin and stdout and we do not want extra information
printed.
<<gcl-2.5.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
\subsubsection{xdrfuns bug patch}
We enabled XDR only to find out that there is a missing argument
in the call to FEerror from xdrstdio\_create. We fix this here and
send a patch to the GCL people. It should be fixed in future releases
and this patch should die.
<<gcl-2.5.xdrfuns.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 8 applying XDR patch to o/xdrfuns.c ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.xdrfuns.c.patch )

\subsubsection{libspad patch}
The second patch changes the {\bf unixport/makefile} to reference
the {\bf libspad.a} library when building the raw system image.
from {\bf libspad.a}
<<gcl-2.4.1.libspad.patch>>=

Subject: Database fixes.

Hi all.

I haven't built Axiom from scratch with the attached changed and added files
but running the following exerpt from the makefile in int/algebra now runs
to completion and so I expect the daase files should rebuild:

  )lisp (make-databases "" nil)

The GCL patch fixes a GCL 2.6.5 vs CVS HEAD GCL deficiency, the src
directory stuff the "makedir" problem I mentioned yesterday.  It hasn't yet
gone into Tim's new port file but that can be sorted out later by whomever.

I won't be available for at least the next 24 hours for anything at all so
best of luck.

Cheers

\section{The Makefile}
We create a dummy file {\bf gcldir} after gcl has been built so
it is not rebuilt. We need to do this because we have no control
over the gcl Makefiles.

Patches are applied to the distribution before we do the configure.
\section{Gnu Common Lisp 2.6.5}
\subsection{gmp wrappers patch}
The file [[gmp_wrappers.h]] has the declaration of the integer [[j]]
out of order. This causes the compiler to complain. This patch puts
the declaration at the beginning of the function.
<<gcl-2.6.5.h.gmp_wrappers.h.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 28 applying gmp_wrappers patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.gmp_wrappers.h.patch )
@
\section{Gnu Common Lisp 2.5.2}
\subsubsection{socket patch}
This patch is to {\bf h/386-linux.defs} to include two 
global variables, {\bf EXTRAS} and {\bf EXTRA\_LIB}
\begin{verbatim}
EXTRAS = ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.o
EXTRA_LIB=${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/libspad.a
\end{verbatim}
The {\bf EXTRAS} variable is used to include two files into the
running image. The {\bf cfuns-c} file contains low-level directory
manipulation routines. The {\bf sockio-c} file contains low level
socket code. Note that versions of GCL beyond gcl-2.4.1 may have
routines already available. If so the Axiom references to these
routines should be rewritten.

We also need to create two .ini files, one for cfuns-c and one
for sockio-c. These are referenced in the gcl-2.4.1 makefiles
but, since no initialization is needed, we simply create empty files.
<<gcl-2.5.2.socket.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.ini ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.ini )
@
<<gcl-2.6.1.socket.patch>>=

	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \

	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \

@
<<gcl-2.6.2a.socket.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \

	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.ini )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.socket.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.ini ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.ini )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.socket.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.mingw.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.ini ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.ini )
@
\subsubsection{fortran patch}
Communication over sockets (basically to the NAG fortran library)
requires us to have XDR enabled.
<<gcl-2.5.2.fortran.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 5 applying HAVE_XDR patch to h/linux.h ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.h.patch )
@
This patch is no longer necessary as of GCL-2.6.1 because the 
C preparser symbol HAVE_XDR is now the default in GCL.
\subsubsection{libspad patch}
The second patch changes the {\bf unixport/makefile} to reference
the {\bf libspad.a} library when building the raw system image.
from {\bf libspad.a}
<<gcl-2.5.2.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.1.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2a.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
\subsubsection{toploop patch}
This patch turns off the banner display every time GCL starts.
We could use the -batch flag but that would be a pervasive change.
It isn't critical to the system builds but we will later be 
capturing stdin and stdout and we do not want extra information
printed.
<<gcl-2.5.2.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.1.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2a.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
\subsubsection{object to float patch}
GCL 2.5.2 contains no reference to this function and it was removed.
Axiom uses this function so we re-implement it here.
<<gcl-2.5.2.objecttofloat.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 8 applying object_to_float patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.cmpaux.c.patch )
@
This patch is no longer necessary as of GCL-2.6.1 because object_to_float
is now defined by default.
\subsubsection{in-package patch}
This changes the common lisp 2.0 defined behavior of in-package
(throw an error if the package does not exist) so that it mirrors
the 1.0 defined behavior (create the package if it does not exist).
This patch is intended to be temporary. Axiom's common lisp code
should be fixed and this patch removed before shipment.
<<gcl-2.5.2.in-package.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 9 applying in-package patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.package.d.patch )
@
I believe that all instances of in-package have been fixed and 
that this patch is no longer necessary.
\subsubsection{EXIT and MAX\_STACK\_SIZE patchs}
Axiom uses EXIT as a function. GCL 2.5.2 decided to make it a 
synonym to the BYE function. We fix this for Axiom.
We also patch the MAX_STACK_SIZE to be 16Mb.
<<gcl-2.5.2.exit.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 10 applying EXIT patch ; \
	  echo 18 applying MAX_STACK_SIZE patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.main.c.patch )
@
As of GCL-2.6.1 EXIT is no longer defined.
<<gcl-2.6.1.exit.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 18 applying MAX_STACK_SIZE patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.main.c.patch )
@
As of GCL-2.6.1 EXIT is no longer defined.
<<gcl-2.6.2.exit.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 18 applying MAX_STACK_SIZE patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.main.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{tail-recursive patch}
Bill Schelter added tail recursion for Axiom. In order to test it
he left code in the system to print a message when the code was
executed. We no longer care but it is still in GCL. We patch the
call rather than the cmpnote function as cmpnote might have later
usage.
<<gcl-2.5.2.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
GCL 2.6.1 renamed the files.
<<gcl-2.6.1.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2a.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.tail-recursive.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 11 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpflet.lsp.patch )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 12 applying tail-recursive noise patch ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.cmpnew.gcl_cmpcall.lsp.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MSYS shell makefile variable patch}
This patch works around a bug in the MSYS make when executing
shell commands.
<<gcl-2.6.5.windows.variable.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 13 applying Windows shell variable patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.1.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MinGW32 gcc 3.4.2 and MinGW32 runtime 3.5 malloc patch}
This patch works around a bug in the MinGW32 runtime which calls malloc
before main - which intrun calls GCL's malloc which has not been =
initialised.
<<gcl-2.6.5.alloc.c.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 14 applying MinGW32 malloc before main workaround to o/alloc.c ; =
\
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.alloc.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MinGW32 directory wildcard patch}
Wildcards were not being passed through - truename not required here.
<<gcl-2.6.5.mingfile.c.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 15 applying MinGW32 directory wildcard patch to o/mingfile.c ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.mingfile.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{MinGW32 probe-file patch}
Names ending with / were not handled corectly.
<<gcl-2.6.5.unixfsys.c.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 15 applying MinGW32 probe-file patch to o/unixfsys.c ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixfsys.c.patch )
@
\subsubsection{collectfn fix}
GCL-2.6.1 renamed collectfn.lsp to gcl_collectfn.lsp.
We rename it back into place because we have later Makefiles
that depend on it. The alternative is to propagate the name changes thru
all of those Makefile and they would now need to know about the =
GCLVERSION
variable. 
<<gcl-2.6.1.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/collectfn.lsp )
@
<<gcl-2.6.2.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/collectfn.lsp )
@
In this version we have created a new subdirectory for use by GCL
during compile time at [[obj/sys/lsp]]. We copy two files from 
GCL, the [[collectfn.lsp]] file and the [[sys-proclaim.lisp]] file. 
The collectfn.lsp contains code which extends the GCL compiler and
collects type information. The compile-file function writes this
type information to a [[.fn]] file as structs. These structs can
be loaded and written out as a file of lisp proclaims. The =
sys-proclaim.lisp
file contains the proclaims for GCL's function definitions.
<<gcl-2.6.2a.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/lsp ; \
	  echo 27 copy sys-proclaim.lisp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp =
; \
	  cp sys-proclaim.lisp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp )
@
<<gcl-2.6.3.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/lsp ; \
	  echo 27 copy sys-proclaim.lisp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp =
; \
	  cp sys-proclaim.lisp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp )
@
<<gcl-2.6.5.collectfn.fix>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/cmpnew ; \
	  echo 26 copy gcl_collectfn.lsp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp ; \
	  cp gcl_collectfn.lsp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/collectfn.lsp )
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/lsp ; \
	  echo 27 copy sys-proclaim.lisp to ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp =
; \
	  cp sys-proclaim.lisp ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp )
@
\subsection{The GCL-2.5.2 stanza}
\subsubsection{Configure and Make GCL}
We enable several features of GCL. 
The [[--enable-readline]] uses GNU readline for the prompts. It has been
removed and replaced with clef which is Axiom's version of readline.
The [[--enable-maxpage]] is set to allow the image to grow 4 times what =
it would by default. 
The [[--enable-vssize]] allows virtual stack to grow by twice the normal =
size. 
The [[--enable-statsysbfd]] uses a static system bfd library for loading =
and
relocating object files.
 
Finally we load some routines for performance reasons. =
[[lsp/sys-proclaim]]
contains common lisp proclaim statements for the various GCL lisp =
routines.
[[cmpnew/gcl_collectfn]] contains modifications to the common lisp =
compiler
to collect compile-time type information which will be written to [[.fn]]
files as common lisp structs. These [[.fn]] files can be loaded and =
turned
into common lisp proclaim statements which the compiler can use to =
generate
faster code, mostly fast-path function calls. The call to =
[[compiler::emit-fn]]
enables the [[.fn]] file generation whenever compile-file is called. We
default this code into the image so it is always avaiable.
<<gclConfigureMake>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION} ; \
	./configure ${LISPCFG} ; \
	${ENV} ${MAKE} ; \
	echo '(progn (load "cmpnew/gcl_collectfn.lsp") (load =
"lsp/sys-proclaim.lisp") (compiler::emit-fn t) (system::save-system =
"${OUT}/lisp"))' | unixport/saved_gcl )
@
GCL 2.5.2 changes are due to David Mentre (david.mentre@wanadoo.fr).
The key problem to solve is that 2.5.2 uses the common lisp 2.0 standard.
In Common Lisp 1.0 if you do (in-package 'foo) and the foo package does
not exist it is created. In Common Lisp 2.0 if you do (in-package 'foo) 
and the foo package does not exist it is an error. The file 
``gcl-2.5.2/o/package.d'' has been changed to keep the old behavior.
This is an incorrect fix in the long term. Axiom should be changed
everywhere to conform to the common lisp 2.0 standard. 

GCL 2.5.2 requires a different Makefile. In particular, GCL 2.5.2
has a different method of building the lisp image. And, just to
keep us on our toes, they've renamed the files we need to patch.
The new patches are in the zips directory. Patches now are prefixed
by GCLVERSION. 

This stanza will be written out when the GCLVERSION variable is
``gcl-2.5.2''. It will overwrite the default version. See the 
top level Makefile.pamphlet.

\subsection{The GCL-2.6.1 stanza}
GCL 2.6.1 has support for --enable-static for static linking.
Axiom will eventually support static images.

GCL 2.6.1 is supposed to build and run on Windows under mingw.
Axiom will eventually support a windows version.

GCL 2.6.1 continues its tradition of renaming files we need to patch.
The new patches are in the zips directory. 

This stanza will be written out when the GCLVERSION variable is
``gcl-2.6.1''. It will overwrite the default version. See the 
top level Makefile.pamphlet.
<<gcl-2.6.1>>=
# gcl version 2.6.1
OUT=${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin

all:
	@echo 1 building ${LSP} ${GCLVERSION}

gcldir: 
	@echo 2 building ${GCLVERSION}

\subsection{The GCL-2.6.2 stanza}
GCL 2.6.2 has support for --enable-static for static linking.
Axiom will eventually support static images.

GCL 2.6.2 is supposed to build and run on Windows under mingw.
Axiom will eventually support a windows version.

GCL 2.6.2 continues its tradition of renaming files we need to patch.
The new patches are in the zips directory. 

This stanza will be written out when the GCLVERSION variable is
``gcl-2.6.2''. It will overwrite the default version. See the 
top level Makefile.pamphlet.

\subsection{The GCL-2.6.2a stanza}

GCL-2.6.2a has a variable si::*optimize-maximum-pages* which defaults
to t which eliminates an old problem of spinning the gc for temporary
allocations of eg. strings in a 32 page space on a heap growing to
quite large size.  You might want to investigate (time ..) and (room)
on computationally intensive jobs with and without this variable set.

``gcl-2.6.2a''. It will overwrite the default version. See the

\section{Gnu Common Lisp 2.5}
GCL 2.5 requires a different Makefile. In particular, GCL 2.5
has a different method of building the lisp image. And, just to
keep us on our toes, they've renamed the files we need to patch.
The new patches are in the zips directory. Patches now are prefixed
by GCLVERSION. 
\subsubsection{socket patch}
This patch is to {\bf h/386-linux.defs} to include two 
global variables, {\bf EXTRAS} and {\bf EXTRA\_LIB}
\begin{verbatim}
EXTRAS = ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.o ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.o
EXTRA_LIB=${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/libspad.a
\end{verbatim}
The {\bf EXTRAS} variable is used to include two files into the
running image. The {\bf cfuns-c} file contains low-level directory
manipulation routines. The {\bf sockio-c} file contains low level
socket code. Note that versions of GCL beyond gcl-2.4.1 may have
routines already available. If so the Axiom references to these
routines should be rewritten.

We also need to create two .ini files, one for cfuns-c and one
for sockio-c. These are referenced in the gcl-2.4.1 makefiles
but, since no initialization is needed, we simply create empty files.
<<gcl-2.5.socket.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.defs.patch )
	@(echo 4 setup ini files for EXTRAS patch ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/cfuns-c.ini ; \
	  touch ${OBJ}/${SYS}/lib/sockio-c.ini )
@ 
\subsubsection{fortran patch}
Communication over sockets (basically to the NAG fortran library)
requires us to have XDR enabled.
<<gcl-2.5.fortran.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
	  echo 5 applying HAVE_XDR patch to h/linux.h ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.h.linux.h.patch )
@
\subsubsection{libspad patch}
The second patch changes the {\bf unixport/makefile} to reference
the {\bf libspad.a} library when building the raw system image.
from {\bf libspad.a}
<<gcl-2.5.libspad.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 6 applying libspad.a patch to unixport/makefile ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.makefile.patch )
@
\subsubsection{toploop patch}
This patch turns off the banner display every time GCL starts.
We could use the -batch flag but that would be a pervasive change.
It isn't critical to the system builds but we will later be 
capturing stdin and stdout and we do not want extra information
printed.
<<gcl-2.5.toploop.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/unixport ; \
	  echo 7 applying toploop patch to unixport/init_gcl.lsp ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.unixport.init_gcl.lsp.in.patch )
@
\subsubsection{xdrfuns bug patch}
We enabled XDR only to find out that there is a missing argument
in the call to FEerror from xdrstdio\_create. We fix this here and
send a patch to the GCL people. It should be fixed in future releases
and this patch should die.
<<gcl-2.5.xdrfuns.patch>>=
	@(cd ${GCLVERSION}/o ; \
	  echo 8 applying XDR patch to o/xdrfuns.c ; \
	  patch <${SPD}/zips/${GCLVERSION}.o.xdrfuns.c.patch )
@

The second patch changes the {\bf unixport/makefile} to reference
the {\bf libspad.a} library when building the raw system image.
from {\bf libspad.a}

\section{Non-portable code}
\subsection{GCL only code}
This section contains code that will only work in Gnu Common Lisp
(GCL). These tagged symbols are split out so we can find suitable
replacements in other common lisps.
\subsubsection{GETENV}
GETENV is a GCL function to return the value of shell variables
from the environment.
<<GCL.GETENV>>=
#+:GCL   SYSTEM:GETENV

\section{New Common Lisp Changes}
\subsection{in-package change}
Common lisp has changed in-package to require a string-designator which
is a character, string, or symbol. Further, if the package does not exist
then in-package will throw an error. We fix this by using defpackage.
We create all of the known packages here.

When using Axiom from within TeXmacs, you clearly forgot to put
the formula inside a pair of dollars in your interface code.
The current output is in text mode.

By the way, you will have another big disadvange when using your
line-breaking code: it will become impossible to copy and paste
part of the output back into TeXmacs.

I am not convinced either that your way of representing fractions
is really more readable. I would rather opt for the / notation
for large fractions. In that case, the standard TeXmacs line-breaking
code will do the job for you.

No. The interface definitely sends $$ before and after
the formula just as they occur in the .tex file that was
captured to a file and which I later imported.

I agree that TeXmacs appears to be in text mode. But the
$$ .... $$ markers are there, so I do not know why.

Do you have any other suggestions on how to debug this?
Are there any other plug-ins working in native Windows
TeXmacs that do successfully produce math mode output?

Perhaps I will have to revert my development of this new
Axiom interface to Linux first and see if the problem
also exists there.

Is that a limitation of the way in which parts of formula
can be selected in TeXmacs? What causes this limitation?
Is it specific to the \over construction. Will it also
happen if I convert to the \frac{}{} construction?

Do you mean simply replacing \over (which Axiom generates
now) wiht just / ? If it is that simple, then perhaps
it would be nice to let the user decide through an option
switch specific during Axiom command input.

Thanks for your continuing help.

Some thoughts on memory management in this context:

1) The free of the getenv pointer is not ifdef'ed in on any current
   platform.  On some older systems the string was allocated via
   malloc in libc.

2) malloc/free are redirected in gcl to natively supplied heap
   allocation functions.  All pointers are between DBEGIN and
   core_end. 

3) If memory serves, Windows, like macosx, emulates sbrk.  Perhaps
   Mike can fill in the details as to the mechanics whereby the heap
   is expanded here.

4) If one suspects overwriting the environment, it would be useful for
   one to compile a debugging gcl, break at siLgetenv, make a test
   call to (si::getenv...) and look at the address of the pointer
   returned by getenv.  Or in Bill's C program.

5) Bill is doing a terrific job!  As is Mike!

Just a thought here -- ideally all this messy portability stuff
belongs in lisp.  If there aren't already lisp functions which can be
used for some of these system related services, I'd be happy to add
same, and in a manner that would mimic any other system we might want
to port to in the future.

Are you sure? Try the --debug-io option under Linux
in order to check that you really send the right thing.

No, it is due to the fact that you output long formulas as a matrix.

Yes, in case of a "long" numerator or denominator.

Whatever you want; you may hack the scheme code in order to
provide such an option.

It seems so. Please check whether you get the same bug under Linux.

Dan,

Can the Windows installer for Axiom also install an icon on
the desktop? If so, here is an icon that I designed based on
the cover of the original Axiom book.

Hmm, strange. If I copy and paste one of the outputs with dollars

Joris,

For the record, I get exactly the same results (text mode)
for the same test done with Cygwin version TeXmac 1.0.4.4,
using the same interface as with native Windows WinTeXmacs.
Is there a newer version for Cygwin?

The output from --debug-io looks identical to that output
from WinTeXmacs.

The new tm_axiom plug-in seems to work fine (except for
text mode output) but the old tm_axiom interface that was
installed with Cygwin from the Cygwin setup.exe program
aborted then I tried to start and Axiom session. Have there
been any other reports of failures of the Axiom interface
under Cygwin?

I wont be able to test the new interface program under
linux until I get time to figure out how to do that
particular kind of threaded execution under Linux.

Anyone know how?

I modified the WinTeXmacs shortcut to include the following
two options:

"C:\Program Files\WinTeXmacs\TeXmacs\bin\tmwin.exe"
   --X-show-console --debug-io

Dan Martin previously explained to me that I can use this
method for debugging under Windows. Attached below is the
complete console output for a simple Axiom session in
WinTeXmax. As you can see, the $$ markers are present but
TeXmacs still displays the output in text mode.

Do you agree that this is a bug - at least in the Windows
version?

Since it is easy and it can use the same tm_axiom interface
I think I will see what happens with the Cygwin version
of TeXmacs.

Thanks for the info. Debian build is labeled `axiom_0.20040831'

I enjoy hearing about these historical anecdotes. Like most large,
long-lived pieces of software, there is an interesting `culture'
associated with it. I remember Stephen Watt mentioning that when he
reads the Axiom source, he can see the changes in programming
methodology/practice which were common at the time the code was
written.

Thank you for bringing this file to my attention. I had yet to read
it. There are a good number of examples which I can now keep in mind
as I continue my trek trough the compiler/interpreter code.

I recall the regression tests, and their future reintegration, being
brought up in past postings. At least having the `Daly bug' list in a
canonical place until that time will give us some sort of baseline.

Again, I recall earlier postings on this issue, and a comparison with
the NIST baseline for numerical code. I also recall mention of a grant
proposal w.r.t CATS. I would be dismayed if such a proposal could not
find sponsorship, considering its general usefulness and `essential'
nature.

I wish I had the mathematical sophistication to contribute to such an
effort. The only domain I have even modest experience in is with
respect to generic polynomial factorization, gcds, etc. However,
others have much more insight into `choosing the right polynomials'
which trigger exponential (say) branches in algorithms, or defeat some
common heuristic techniques. However, I do have some Aldor code which
implements functionality, and some recent algorithms, not present in
Axiom. When I get the chance to port it over perhaps I could
contribute to CATS in this area.

I have never programed on windows. Is malloc guaranteed to return

passing a fresh pointer from malloc to putenv.

Subject: Various Windows related items

Hi all.

A series of brief notes to square a few loose ends away before the weekend:


1. Bill's getenv bug report:

Bill, I'm sorry about the unintentionally patronising tone of my email the
other day; I was in a hurry and trying to eliminate possibilities without
due regard for what I was writing - I am, of course, pleased to be working
with you on knocking Windows GCL into a state where it reliably builds
Axiom!


2. Stephen's potential fix to Bill's problem:

Stephen, thanks for pointing out that rather nasty bug in
cfuns-c.c.pamphlet - hopefully the answer to the problem Bill is seeing.
The relevant passage should read (warning untested code):

#ifdef MSYSplatform
    sprintf(newpath, "PATH=%s;%s", path, dir);
#else /* MSYSplatform */
    sprintf(newpath, "PATH=%s:%s", path, dir);
#endif /* MSYSplatform */

Bill, could you please try this out and see if it helps?  I've changed the
ndef to a def and the Windows branch uses a semi-colon.


3. Database rebuild:

On Wednesday I had not done a clean and rebuild with the mods I reported in
place - I have now done so and the daase files were constructed and
installed correctly.


4. Bill's observation re the Windows section in the Makefile:

Bill, this is probably the result of my being slightly out of sync with the
Arch archive.  If there is a merge required please feel free because, as you
know, I have been unable to convince tla to help me out on this project.


5.  The coming weekend.

I will again be out of touch for at least 24 hours starting this evening.
We are, however, approaching a satisfactory ending to this series of
problems which will be worth all the trouble in the long run.

Sounds good to me.  May I suggest that we could add extra Axiom lib object

imagine it would also be relatively easy to close off the warnings from the
compiler with a new option variable in the GCL compiler package - thus
eliminating several of the patches currently applied by the Axiom build.

With these changes and those bug fixes already applied as patches we should
be failry close to what would be required for a proposed GCL 2.6.6 release.

I've lost track of which GCL CVS branch I should check in the Windows
alterations, by the way?

There is a branch effort for common lisp portability issues on called
axiom--sbcl--1 (the volunteers want axiom on sbcl). The idea is instead 
of modifying each lisp for axiom we figure out how to do the C lib 
routine (such as sockets) from the lisp level in each lisp. Then we
could #+ and #- the code. sbcl apparently has both sockets and CLX
for the X functions. It's likely that GCL does also but I just haven't
had the time to look at the API that the axiom C lib needs.

Wonderful. I would like to get a full update of the build.
It tried piecing it together from the files that you sent
earlier, but I seem to be missing something. Perhaps you
could do a repeat of the original upload to axiom-developer.org
and Tim could re-build the axiom--windows--1 branch. If you
do this, let me know and I will grab the tarball directly
from axiom-developer.

I suggest that before doing the next upload of that kind, that
you first prune all of the unnecessary cruft from the zips
directory. Only the gcl-2.6.5.tgz and gcl-2.6.5 patch files
are relevant to the windows build.

BTW, when you access axiom-developer from windows do you use
putty and psftp?

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

I have found these programs to be especially reliable - much
better than just the ports of ssh and sftp and scp that I have
also used under cygwin and MSYS. In particular psftp has the
ability to re-start a download or upload (reget, reput) and that
has saved me a lot of time - especially upload where I still have
to live by the limitations of slow modem connections.

Subject: Release?

Dear Tim and all axiom-developers,

since there is such great progress on the MS Windows side -- as far as I
understand there is a working binary distribution, wouldn't it make sense to
announce a 1.0 release of axiom, just before Christmas?

I would ask you to apply the patches provided on savannah, those that I
submitted I am very confident of and they are somewhat tested, since I used the
concerned operations quite a bit. Some of them fix serious mathematical
problems, so I'd be concerned to release without them being applied.

If you and everybody else agrees, I'd favor a release in order to do a little
advertising -- also with respect to the bounties. 

Just before Christmas would be great, since I suspect that quite a lot of
people who have holidays might find a little time to try it out.

I listed some communities that I would inform on the MathAction Todolist. Of
course, this list is a result of "brainstorming", so it is not to be taken too
seriously. However, I would include the following points in an announcement:

* Axiom 1.0 is out. It is available for many major plattforms, including Linux
  and MS Windows. See
  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload

* It is very mature blablabla, work is in progress to implement features which
  are still missing. See
  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/WishList. 

* Bounties are offered to implement important new features.

(I argue for pamphlet support on MathAction -- this might attract some LaTeX
 gurus -- numerical integration and Aldor support. If there is agreement, maybe
 somebody could help with the pricing and the precise formulation)

Subject: Re: Release?

Martin,

I haven't tried the new axiom exe files yet (I have to secure access
to a windows box and I just found out about it at midnight last night).
Assuming it works (and even if it fails we fix it) there is no possible
objection to announcing it. It appears that the .exe file does not do
a system build so it doesn't require any development tools.

It is clear there is a widespread interest in the windows version just
from the number of downloads so far. So it is a good idea to try and
meet this demand as soon as possible. 

I'm not sure what "announcing" it really means. Clearly I've made no
effort to build up a "marketing and sales" channel for axiom so there
is no obvious place to "announce". You're welcome to take the lead in
this (aka "director of marketing" :-) ) and figure out a way to market
axiom. I'll provide what help I can but I'm a complete novice at this.

Perhaps the easiest way would be to put up wiki pages. I'm willing to
be the test case for these pages as I'm going to play with the .exe
file shortly.

IBM, RedHat, and Red Flag Linux (China) have all announced "ISV
certification programs" that are intended to certify that programs
work on their respective platforms. Perhaps an effort to contact
these people would get us much more exposure much faster as well as
resources to build, test, and support axiom. The Red Flag Linux 
program includes "propaganda" as part of the package.

Merging the code base into the main branch is significantly more work.
Several questions come to mind...

Will the axiom--windows--1 branch build cleanly on windows?

  by this I mean that I can download the tla file to a freshly
  installed windows box and build it.

  what is the procedure? it should work by typing 'make'

  is there a tla for windows?

  what software must the user install on the box? 
  clearly some form of gcc and latex plus awk, grep, rm, etc.
  
  what is MSYS and where can I get it? should we package it in zips?

  what does Windows use to read dvi files? should we cross-compile
  and package advi (which is already in zips?) or should the windows
  build automatically create pdf files?

  is the version of gcl on the axiom--windows--1 branch the one that
  should be used with windows? does it also build with linux?

  is there a <<Makefile-windows>> stanza in the top level Makefile.pamphlet?

  I haven't been involved in any of this so I'm unclear about what
  exact steps are required.

  I don't yet have the ability to support questions about this branch
  as I don't yet have access to a windows machine.

  there appears to have been an issue about file names and path names
  have these issues been resolved?

beyond the algebra portion comes the question of sockets

  will it compile cleanly under the windows MSYS environment?
  does the axiom socket code work on windows?
  does sman compile?

and the question of X compatibility

  does the graphics code compile?
  does it run?

on linux the graphics exists, sman exists, and hypertex is nearing
completion (it segfaults but I'll find it eventually). have we looked
at getting these branches to compile?

I did spend two hours in the bookstore yesterday reading thru a book
on windows sockets. They look very similar but I'm certain there are
compiling issues. gcc won't know about windows sockets.

I'll diff the two branches (main and windows) and merge as much as
I can test. And if you'll set up an instructions page on Page's site
or send me instructions I'll set up a test environment on the windows
box.

I'm rather reluctant to merge the code bases until I can assure 
myself that I can build the system on both platforms and test it 
from the sources. It's not apparent to anyone but I'm nearly 
always running a system build and tests on some machine or other.
Merging the code and pushing it out to savannah isn't an issue
for people who want to just use it. The savannah code needs to 
be as clean as we can make it so new developers aren't struggling
with poor code. It's a quality issue.

That is correct. The file at

http://page.axiom-developer.org/axiom-0.1.exe

is a binary "installer" file. It is a self-decompressing program
that just unfolds into the directories and files required to run
Axiom. Plus it does a few things to the Windows environment like
defining the AXIOM environment variable and adding the bin
directory to the PATH. This is the way most software is installed
on Windows computers.

Over 200 already - that is for the version that requires a little
manual setup work. The only difference with the new one is that
setup is automatic and convenient for people who are less familiar
with Windows development.

Well, in the case of Maxima at least we announce on Freshmeat and

Uh - at best I think you will need a fresh windows install + free
compile tools.  To the best of my knowledge default windows doesn't
include any tools for development of software, although perhaps that
has changed.

Which gets back to my earlier point - ideally we should at least give
the user the option of one massive, self contained install.exe file
that will install everything needed on a clean windows box.  Maybe the
"default" way will be to have people install some supporting software
themselves, but I still think a TOTALLY self contained install.exe will
give the best impression.
   
>   what is MSYS and where can I get it? should we package it in zips?

http://www.mingw.org/

Typically I think msys is installable, and people download tar.gz of
other components they want and decompress them in the msys shell.  I
would say a big axiom_development_environment.exe file with all the
right versions of everything already set up would be an act of mercy,
based on my earlier experiences trying to build Maxima on windows, but
perhaps it is appropriate that the barrior of entry be at least that
high on the developer side.

My recommendation would be to create pdf files - dvi is fairly foreign
to a normal windows environment.  Is there an advantage to using dvi?

The default answer is that graphics programs written for X will not
work on windows unless an X server is present.  Normally the way I run
X graphical software on windows is to use the cygwin environment - I
would NOT recommend that as a general solution for normal windows
users.  cygwin is an amazing piece of work, but X programs under
windows will feel and act differently than normal programs, and in my
experience this doesn't go over well.

If I recall, the moral equilavent to X on windows is GDI.  Really, the
only options I can think of off the top of my head is to either provide
a GDI/Windows version of the graphics, or port them to some common
graphics toolkit.

FWIW, the long term solution I envision for Maxima in this respect is
to port McCLIM to windows, build off of scigraph to create whatever
graphical abilities were needed, impliment 3D graphing in McCLIM, and
live happily ever after with native interfaces and graphics everywhere.
 

Advantages:  Write once in lisp, run anywhere McCLIM has been
implimented.  Usual benefits of lisp programming.  Front end could
probably be used to interface with different CASs, if anyone wanted to
impliment the protocals.

Disadvantages:  A truly staggering amount of work, with n+1 learning
curves I don't even know about yet to climb.

Well, that's what I meant, too: I collected the communities - mailing lists,
where I'd announce it on MathAction.

Tim, how much effort is it to integrate the patches on Savannah?

If this can be done, I'd be willing to "announce". Regarding Universities, I'd
need some help, though: I'll be able to do: University of Vienna, Technical
University of Vienna, LaBRI/Bordeaux, Lyon and I'll ask Ralf to do Linz.

To do means: ask somebody to distribute the announce mail on the "scientific
staff mailing list" (at least that's what we call it here in Austria)

Martin, Bill, 

I ran the install script on a windows box and at completion (when I click
'finish') it starts axiom but immediately fails with the message:

Error: Cannot open the file c:/cvs/head/axiom/mnt/windows/algebra/compress.daase


However, an axiom icon appears on the desktop and clicking on that works.
I'm really quite impressed. It worked on a normally installed windows
system with no problems that I can see. Amazing. Simply amazing.

If we're going to announce this to a broader audience (and we should)
perhaps we should consider a few things...

First I think we need a bug-reporting script somewhere so people who
are not developers can contact us with problems.

Second I think we need to firm up some documentation, perhaps the
tutorial (book volume 1) and make it also appear on the desktop.
And we need to get it into a publishable form quickly.

Third I think we need to modify the graphic on the icon as I'm not
sure of the status of the book front cover. Perhaps we can use the
blue bayou graphic with an overlaid 'axiom' word instead. That icon
is nice piece of work on somebody's part.

I'm now in the process of installing the msys environment. Once I
do that I'm going to 
1) download the axiom--windows--1 branch to see if I can get it to build. 
2) If that succeeds I'll proceed with merging the axiom--windows--1 branch 
   into axiom--main--1
3) test axiom--main--1 on both linux and windows
4) get axiom--main--1 repackaged for linux (rpm, deb) and windows
5) move axiom--main--1 to savannah

As to the issue of announcing, feel free to make any announcements you
feel are appropriate. The sci.math.symbolic mailing lists, etc are a
good idea. Perhaps once it appears there we could convince franz and
other lisp companies to give us a work environment (e.g. zero cost
software) to recover the version of axiom that used to work on their
software.

Excellent work all around. 

You did remember to put your names in the README file and the

Actually, the axiom conference will follow on the heels of a
group theory conference which I'm also helping to organize.
However these are currently disjoint audiences (until I get
the group theory algebra moved into axiom).

The "sprint" is a very appealing idea. We have a lab with about 20
machines over which I have complete control. It would be very
productive (and from my point of view a huge amount of fun) to get a
group of developers together. I know we manage to make progress now
but it would be so much more productive to have many eyes on problems
at the same location. Plus we could have a good discussion of future
directions, additional algebra, etc.

So is there any interest in either or both of these ideas
(a two-day vs one-day conference, a 'sprint' meeting)?

I think we can announce the availability of the axiom.exe for

I tested installation on A Dell machine (P4) running Windows 98SE using the
executable
http://page.axiom-developer.org/axiom-0.1.exe

The installation proceeds smoothly and I had chosen custom install which
includes the checkbox: Add to path, Documentation, Source Code (all checked).
(Custom is selected automatically as a consequence). The path was the default
path c:\Program Files\axiom.

I rebooted the system, as requested. An axiom folder appears in the
Start->Program menu and clicking on Axiom->Axiom starts a MSDOS Windows, with
Axiom started, but giving the same error message as Tim gets (and the system
stay in BOOT>>). I then click on the Desktop icon Axiom, same thing (unlike
Tim's response).

Two comments:
(1) If the system fails after starting, I suggest that in addition to the error
message, then a message on how to get out of BOOT and Axiom be given, returning
to DOS. (The :H does not help in the Windows 98SE DOS because it is limited to
24 lines). Of course, one can always kill the DOS window, but that does not give
a good impression.
(2) Better still, since most Windows users will not be familiar or even know
what BOOT is, and the :H listing will look like gibberish, it should perhaps not
be the default setting (that is do not go into BOOT at error).

Now I repeat testing installation on another Windows machine (running XP
Professional (SP2), and the path is J:\Program Files\Axiom, and I have exactly
what Tim got (error in DOS when click finish after installation; but no problem
with Desktop icon start, and no problem with Start->Program->Axiom->axiom start
-- this is contrary to the Windows 98SE version).

Thanks a million to all who worked hard to make Axiom running for Windows.

I will look into this problem. I can also reproduce it here
provided that no previous install of Axiom exists. I think that
it must have something to do with the timing of the setting
of the AXIOM variable since that is the message one would
expect if it was not set (Axiom is looking in the wrong place
of the database files).

Yes. By that time the AXIOM variable is obviously set correctly.

Perhaps we can include a link to the "issues" section of MathAction

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage/issuetracker

This is an "easy to use" bug tracking system.

If the user chooses "documentation" during the install, the
axiom-book.pdf (the whole 1000+ page book) and tutorial.pdf
files are also copied. There is a link to them under

  Start/Programs/Axiom

tutorial.pdf is a version of the tutorial that was distributed
with NAG's windows version of Axiom but it has been adapted to
refer to the TeXmacs interface instead of techexplorer.

Perhaps it would be nice to have the planned volume 1 of the book
instead of the whole book.

>

I doubt that it is a copyrightable issue. But I agree that it is
only a "first effort". I was just playing around when I designed
it. I thought about using the icon that was provided with NAG's
windows version, but then I thought that it looks just as "ugly"
as my primative effort. It would be nice if we could get a real
graphic artist to do something nice for us.

> Perhaps we can use the blue bayou graphic with an overlaid 'axiom'

If someone can send me a new .ico file, I would be glad to
substitute it.

You will also need tla for windows from

  http://download.sipsolutions.de/tla-setup.exe

and the windows LaTeX packaged called MikTex

  http://www.miktex.org/setup.html

The "Small MiKTeX" package is sufficient if your windows box is
connected to the Internet. Or if you want you can install the
complete system.

It will fail unless you first merge the files sent to you by
Mike Thomas last week. I have not yet suceeded in merging these
properly into axiom--windows--1 myself. Let me know if you get
this to work. Otherwise we will need Mike's assistance.

Good plan.

But I also agree with Martin Rubey that some priority should be
give to the patches currently waiting in Savannah. Some of these
are necessary even to reproduce the simple numerical results in
Martin Dunstan's tutorial.

Given the average Windows user nowadays are unfamiliar with DOS commands (let
alone Unix 'cat'), I think it would not be advisable to announce or release to
the general scientific public at this time.

If we can get Texmacs window packaged with Axiom Windows release, that is a
different story. The snapshot sometime ago posted (by Mike Thomas:on Mon Dec 6,
texmacs_axiom_windows.jpg) is the kind of experience Windows users expect. I
think we need to give them a very good user experience (in addition to the
math-computation experience) so users can become productive right away "off the
box".

Incidentally, I double-clicked on tm_axiom.exe in the j:/Program
Files/axiom/mnt/windows/bin directory and a window appeared and disappeared
immediately. How should I start texmacs correctly?

Yes, opening a DOS windows on Windows 98SE, and 

set AXIOM=c:\Progra~1\Axiom\mnt\windows

and then start

axiomsys

then Axiom runs without the error message.

But )summary and )copyright still give an error message:

Bad command or file name
which presumably refers to 'cat'.

Continue with

)sys tm_axiom

or start a new DOS windows and 

tm_axiom

produces Xverbatim:Xchannel:promptXXlatex:\red$\rightarrow$\ XXXverbatim:

where X stands for some graphic character (not all the same).

Under XP SP2 DOS window, 

tm_axiom

simply returns to command prompt.

William,

Thank you for trying the installation on an older Windows

to be changed to accommodate older systems which set
environment variables differently than Windows 2000, and

This would have to be done in the Axiom coding.

Of course these comments also apply to most Linux users.
I agree that exiting to BOOT should not be the default
behaviour. It would be better to simply exit. An option
to exit to BOOT could be provided for developers and
advanced debugging.

Bill, Willaim,

In general there is an option )set break break which will 
cause axiom to break to lisp when an error occurs. The usual
case is that it just returns to the top level loop. In this
case, however, the break is fatal as it cannot find the databases.

I'll fix the break error messages.

Under windows the equivalent command to send the contents of a
file to stdout is 'type' rather than 'cat'. This is one of the
examples of the way in which Axiom currently depends on the
operating system. The general solution is to write these simple
operations in lisp and not to depend on the shell.

In the mean time, until these functions are re-written in lisp,
we can provide a temporary equivalent in the Axiom bin directory
via a simple C program.

I think the ')cd' command depends on some other linux specific
code for which Mike Thomas has already submitted a windows
patch but it is not in the version of Axiom that is included
in the current install file. I will check on this. This
command should work as you expect.

That seems like an exaggeration to me. It would be hard to
get rid of these basic command language idioms from Axiom
when run in this mode. Users who use this mode should be
made aware of the basic set of commands. But see below.

TeXmacs for a graphical interface is definitely possible. But
it needs to be installed separately. Go to

http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/download/windows.en.html

and download the file wintexmacs-1.0.4.4.exe

This program installs the same way as Axiom (in fact is was
ported to Windows by the same person - Dan Martens - who did
the initial version of the Windows installer that I have only
modified a little.

Packaging TeXmacs with Axiom is possible and has been discussed
briefly with Dan Martens but he pointed out that the resulting
file would be a rather large download (22 Mb + 15 Mb.) I think
installing two programs is not too complicated.

tm_axiom.exe is the "interface" program that is not intended
to be run directly by the user. If TeXmacs is installed, then
tm_axiom.exe is called by TeXmacs internally in order to "talk"
with Axiom.

But TeXmacs must be separately installed. See above.

If TeXmacs is installed, then the menu item

  Insert/Session/Axiom

will start an Axiom session inside TeXmacs and you will be
able to type type Axiom commands and see nicely formatted
output.

The tutorial that you can reach from the Start menu

   Start/Programs/Axiom Tutorial

has a section that describes the use of TeXmacs.

I followed your instructions and installed TeXmacs. At first it hangs when run
the first time. Rerunning it eventually opens up the windows and I can pull down
the menu Insert->Session->Axiom. Then it displays a cyan long an thin rectangle
across the width of the white area (which disappears if the focus is not TeXmacs
window), with the "axiom]" (no quotes) where a red vertical line crosses the
letter o (which also disappears if window is out of focus). The status bar says
"generic axiom program roman 10 blue [dead]". I type 1 + 1 and press enter, the
program hanged with entire window going blank with (Not Responding) and had to
be killed. This can be reproduced several times. Both startup and shutdown took
relatively long time (6 secs, I am using a P4 2.4GHz 1GB ram machine, running
XP).

I realize that the red vertical line is the cursor but it was not placed in the
right place. 

Both TeXmacs and Axiom are installed as subfolders of J:\Program Files.

Any help would be much appreciated.

I will not announce Axiom 1.0 without those bugs fixed, that result in a
mathematical mistake and where a fix is available. These bugs are *not*
details! I rather have axiom go to boot and a cryptic error message that I can
notice than return an innocent looking but embarrassingly wrong answer! (I

but at least we should fix those which are easy to fix!)

BTW: Camm, could you submit your patch for "new" to savannah? I agree with

It would be great if we could have a "real" release just before February, since
February is again a month where many people do not have to teach and might find

The symptoms that you describe sound like AXIOMsys.exe and
tm_axiom.exe are not in the PATH. If you open a MSDOS command
windows and type

 C:\... > path

You should see

  C:\Program files\axiom\mnt\windows\bin;

in the list of directories.

And you should also be able to simply type

 C:\... > axiomsys

to start Axiom. 

If not then the Axiom install did not complete properly.
But if axiom is in the default path, then TeXmacs should
find it.

TeXmacs takes a long time to startup when first installed
because it is building some tables of font information, but
I have not had it truly hang when I have tried it.

That's good because it means that it found AXIOMsys.exe

That's bad. When you see "axiom]" it means that for some reason
it can not run tm_axiom.exe (the interface program). What you

That's normal.

That is similar to the configuration of my Windows PC. 6 secs is
about right for TeXmacs startup.

Make sure that you can run 'axiomsys' and 'tm_axiom' from the
command line (normally you do *not* try to run 'tm_axiom' this
way, but this is just a test to see if it is accessible). Let
me know the results.

If it turns out that for some reason

  C:\Program files\axiom\mnt\windows\bin;

is not in the Path, on Windows 2000 and XP you can add it manually
by clicking

  Start / Control Panel (classic view) / system / Advanced / Environment
Variables

On older windows systems this would be set in AUTOEXEC.BAT

But all of this should be done automatically by the Axiom
installer program. I have a new version of the installer that
I think should work better. I will upload it later today.

Just a quick note to say that I'm badly bound up time wise for the coming

Regarding cat, cd etc; even if you use the respective DOS commands, those

Windows GCL.  Sure, you can knock the paths into shape before calling
system() but that still (apart from being a hassle) leaves you open to the

either doing those commands in Lisp as suggested by Camm last week or as a
second best/temporary fix - cfuns-c.  I believe that si::chdir is the GCL
directory setting Lisp equivalent.  I have so far only addressed mkdir via
cfuns-c if my memory serves, but I believe that the best solution would be
to add ensure-directory-exists to the stable build of GCL.

I would personally urge you to seriously consider solving those system()
related issues before doing an advertised public release.  They aren't major
problems to solve and could have a fairly large negative impact on user
expectations if left untended.

Finally, thanks for the enormous effort you have put into the new installer.

Yes, I would be very pleased if you could do that. I will

I suggest that before zipping up your local stable build
that you *first* prune all the irrelevant stuff out of the
axiom zips directory. Only gcl-2.6.5 and related patches
are needed for the windows build. The rest of the files
can not be used with windows but took up more than half

I wrote a simple cat program that does this for Windows and
it is included in the most recent version of the Windows
installer. As far as I know, it is only needed for trivial
things like )summary.

Once I have a working windows build, I can debug the cfuns-c
if necessary. But I agree that the best approach is the use
the GCL native commands were possible (everywhere I think).
I think very soon cfuns-c should be made to disappear.

Yes, that works. In Axiom the following command changes the
default directory:

  )lisp (si:chdir "new/directory")

but the native Axiom command

  )cd new/directory

does not work. Odd.

Well, there is still the open source philosophy "release often
..." So far we are way behind in that process. I am really not
so sure exactly what user expectations really are, but I do know
that nearly 250 people have already downloaded the current
windows binary. I am sure that if we have more (many more?)
interested users, then most of these issues will be resolved
sooner. After all, we are not "bringing a product to market"
here! It is more like we are trying to build a developer and
user community.

I tracked down the lisp code (function |cd| in src/interp/patches.lisp)

Bill,

fyi, if you're going to do a lot of lisp debugging from the top
level loop of axiom you'll find it useful to do:

)lisp (setq boot::$dalymode t)

this has the effect of making any expression that begins with
an open paren into a call to lisp. Thus,

--> )lisp (+ 1 1)

can now be written directly as

--> (+ 1 1)

This is documented in src/interp/int-top.boot but you might have

The |cd| function has a function call:

Axiom uses this to set the current directory before calling the

Mathematica into regions where it has trouble, and the ability to do 2D
input in Mathematica is a big, big, big usability boost.  That alone

Best case, spot the article and be ready with some concrete examples
where Mathematica should work and doesn't. Realistically, make a
product that the casual user can't distinguish from Mathematica as far
as usability goes.  That's probably what it will take.

Yep, quite normal.  Really "hot" stories can have over a thousand,
although 250 is pretty good for a specialized topic like math software.
 It helps that Mathematica and Maple are so expensive - open source
advocates always keep an eye out for good replacements to expensive
commercial tools.

Maxima wins primarily because a) It's been in the "public eye" longer,
and b) it's fairly well integrated into the Windows and Linux operating
environments.  (Well, maybe that's stretching it on Windows, but it
does work pretty well.)  Also, I think there is a sense that Maxima is
more "practical, make the logical assumptions, get the calculation
done" while Axiom is "do it right, period."  Which is fine - there are
situations where you want both.  Maxima might even evolve a little
towards Axiom's style over time.  I think Axiom has the design moral
high ground, but Maxima is currently the program in the trenches.  I
guess I envision Maxima as starting on the road to being a better
Mathematica, and Axiom as being on the road to being something purer
than either, but a tad harder for mortals to get started on.

A 1.0 release will really boot Axiom into the "public eye", and will
get it a lot more eyeballs.  Plus, the presence of the Axiom book is a
big help.  Regardless, personally I'm still grooving out over having
TWO free, high quality CASs to use - talk about the end users being the
winners.

I agree, but they are right in two ways currently - as of yet no
TeXmacs or Emacs environment for any of the free CASs comes even close
to Mathematica's front end for smoothness and friendlyness.  I still
think that interface can be equaled or even exceeded, but to give
credit where it's due it won't be a simple task.

The second way Mathematica wins is third party extras.  The biggest one
I know of for Mathematica in academia is probably Feyncalc (I suspect
engineering has their own I don't know about.)  Feyncalc would, by
itself, keep whole physics departments on Mathematica.  By the same
token, that functionality in one or more free CASs might enable them to
switch.  Again, not trivial.  (I always wondered, though, if Axiom's
strong typing might ultimately lend itself to the kind of things
Feyncalc does...)

Of course, neither of those concerns will stop new, broke users from
seeking us out, but unfortunately there ARE still a few benefits to a

I have used both Maple and Mathematica extensively and all
I can say is that Mathematica has a better marketing strategy.
My experience with both is the main reason I am motivated to
help make Axiom available again. I think Axiom got a raw deal
when the commercial territory was staked out a few years ago.

A waste of time - mostly. If you spend any time on the
Mathematica and/or Maple mailing lists you can find a lot of
examples where they don't work but should. That is normal.
People write research papers about this. I am more interested
however to know what the developers do when such problems
are identified. I think that it is here that open source
development could have a major advantage.

Again I think it isn't worth the effort. If people think they
want Mathematica (and have the money), great. The more people
learn about computer algebra systems the better. Later they
might learn what else they really want in such a system.
I think one has to take a long term view.

I agree completely. I hope that we can do more to make
Axiom easier for the first time user. But I expect that
Axiom will continue to have the most appeal for "advanced"
users and developers.

I have frequently argued against the amount of time and effort
that Maple's developers have devoted to user interface over the
last 5 years. (I think it is currently better than Mathematica
in some ways - worse in others) And in the most recent shift to
Java as the user interface platform it very nearly broke their
product until hardware advances and the subsequent .5 software
release caught up. Anyone can do user interface. But as far as
I am concerned it is the mathematics inside that counts.

Neither Maple nor Mathematica have anywhere near as complete
a mathematical document capability as TeXmacs and I don't
think they should even try to get to that stage. It would be
much better if they were to continue to move to a more open
development environment and encourage others (like TeXmacs)
and Scientific Workplace etc. to provide the interface.

All that I expect of a user interface for research purposes
is that it not be too distracting from the usual mathematical
notations used. From this point of view both Maple and
Mathematica have been adequate since earlier releases (aside
from some obvious typographical deficiencies which still exist
in both).

There are many many well developed engineering and physics
applications for both Mathematica and Maple. E.g.

http://www.maplesoft.com/applications/index.aspx

Most of these have been developed by users. Most of these
users could have just as easily developed software for Axiom
or Maxima (some already have).

> ... unfortunately there ARE still a few benefits to a

I don't think that either Mathematica or Maple could be
described as having a "massive staff and development budget".
Both depend primarily on user developed applications and
research done by third parties. In the early days both of
them benefited greatly by the pioneering efforts of the
Axiom developers.

If you forget about user interface and look at how the
Maple development environment is changing over the last
few releases, it is obvious that it is evolving towards
the places where Axiom has already been. I don't think that
this is by accident.

In MSYS ~ is expanded as $HOME = /home/username as you would
expect in a unix shell environment. But being a single user
system by design native Windows does not have any exact
equivalent of /home/username. Axiom for Windows does not
assume that it is run from within the MSYS environment.

The closest thing to /home/username is perhaps

  c:\Documents and Settings\username

on Windows 2000/XP systems but the analogy is not exact and
it is not used the same way by most windows applications.

Under Axiom for Windows we get

(1) -> )lisp (truename (si::getenv "HOME"))

   >> System error:
   Cannot coerce NIL to a PATHNAME.

because the environment variable HOME is not defined.

Yes, I suppose we could ask the user what they want the
default directory for AXIOM to be and default it to, say

  c:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents

(overridable by the user)

We could set the environment variable HOME to point there -
provided that HOME is not already pointing somewhere else
for some other purpose (possible but not likely).

It might be better if there was an AXIOM specific home,
like AXIOMHOME. Or we could default it to something off
the AXIOM variable that is pointing into the mnt/windows
tree. But since the default for installation is

  C:\Program Files

and it is not normal to store user editable files there,
this might not be such a good idea.

Unfortunately, even if we do set HOME, the GCL truename
function still does not currently work with "~/" in
GCL-2.6.5 on Windows. This is probably just an oversight
in the GCL coding.

------

I should clarify also that under newer versions of Windows,
since Windows 2000 at least, it is possible to setup Windows
for multiple users. It is possible to install programs that
are accessible to all users or to just to a specific user.
These versions of Windows map shortcuts like "My Documents"
(when referenced inside windows but not if used inside a
MSDOS shell) to username specific directories such as

  c:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents

Other user's specific directories are normally protected
from access, depending on access rights etc. Some directories
can be shared by different users of the same system. On
these windows platforms it would be nice if GCL (and therefore
AXIOM) was aware of the shortcuts. It would not be unreasonable
then to interpret "~/" as the current user's Windows
"My Documents" shortcut.

Also, in an office network environment it is common for
some of the user specific directories to reside on network
drives for backup purposes etc. This could also complicate
matters for some people.

------

So in the end, I am not sure what the most general choice
of "HOME" should be for Windows users. Perhaps your suggestion
is best - to let the user decide at installation time - but
then this might be a difficult question for some less
experienced Windows users to answer, so we still need a
reasonable default. And this does not handle very well the
case when Axiom is installed for shared use by multiple
users of the same machine.

This requires some careful thought when trying to maximize
the portability between Linux and Windows.

Oh, yeah, and just to complicate the axiom build (since we're
shipping a packaged binary for windows) you should know that
axiom will run faster if you remove all of the .o files in
the obj subdirectory and redo the make.

What happens is that the first make will not only create the
compiled files but will also output the .fn files. These files
contain exact information about types used in function calling.
If the type information for foo.lisp (or foo.lsp) is available
at compile time and the foo.fn file is available from a previous
compile then the lisp compiler can lay down much more efficient
code for function calling. Since axiom is all about function 
calling this will make a significant difference in speed.

Great. I did a tla update for axiom--windows--1 on my windows
machine and also started an Axiom build just a few minutes ago.
On this machine the build usually takes about 2 hours. I will

It is called NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System). See

  http://nsis.sourceforge.net

I downloaded and installed the 2.03 release.

> Can we make this part of the build for windows?

Yes, this should be quite easy. Of course you need NSIS
installed, then all you need is a script file that describes
the contents of the release. Using this script file the
NSIS "compiler" collects everything and outputs the installable
.exe file.

I can send you the current NSIS script file that I am using
if you like or you can get it by actually doing an install
from

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/axiom-windows-0.1.0.exe

You will find the script is called

  axiom.nsi

and is in the root of the axiom directory after the install.

Oops. I just re-installed Axiom on another system and I get

I had earlier tested after installing Axiom in a directory

name 'Program Files' contained a space and this string is
not delimited by Axiom when calling cat, the file name is

No, my build also failed like yours did. I saw this type
of failure before in my attempts to build Axiom for Windows

fixed this problem. I will check back through my emails and
notes to see if I can find it. In the mean time I am now

The 'cat' program is not part of this build. It is just a
simple replacement for the 'cat' command found in the

One should not underestimate the importance of advertising.  For every
person who posts on a site like slashdot, there are at least 50 people
just reading the comments, and at least some of those don't want to
hear "maple or mathematica" because they've already tried them (e.g.
me, a year ago).  While I don't think we should coordinate an
organized effort to find "ask slashdot" type websites, we should make
sure Axiom is available to those who go looking for it.  Attracting
users and potential developers is critically important to the survival
of an open source application.

The attitude that "let's make it great first, then tell people" is
guaranteed to prevent the project from attracting developers.

I don't know about Emacs on Windows (never used it), but
other Linux programs ported to Windows that I have used
such as TeXmacs, GIMP, and arch do not define a HOME variable
however they do seem to all put their .files in the directory

  C:\Documents and Settings\username

This is a fairly reasonable choice for initialization files
which are not usually hidden and not edited directly by the
user but which are specific to a username. But unlike Linux,
this is not a particularly good choice as a place to store
user files since the Windows user has to perform some (usually
unfamiliar) navigation in the directory tree in order to find
this directory. On the other hand most users are immediately
familiar with the directory

  C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents

which appears as the 'My Documents' shortcut icon on their
desktop. This is the default location for the creation of
new user files. Novice windows users however may not be aware
that the above is it's full path name and that the 
My Documents directory of other users of the same machine
will be in a different path.

\section{Axiom debugging}
In order to debug Axiom it is sometimes necessary to trace lisp functions.
This is tedious in the extreme. There are thousands of functions and the
stack gets very deep so finding function names (which are case-sensitive)
is time consuming.

In order to speed up this process there are a couple useful things to know.

First, the top level loop of Axiom will allow you to execute any lisp
function by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
)lisp (function arg arg...)
\end{verbatim}
This also quickly gets tedious. A slightly faster method is to do the
following:
\begin{verbatim}
)lisp (setq $dalymode t)
\end{verbatim}
This will change the top level read loop semantics so that any 
expression that starts with an open-paren is interpreted as lisp code.
Thus:
\begin{verbatim}
(1) -> (1 + 1)
   2
                         Type: PositiveInteger
(2) -> )lisp (setq $dalymode t)
Value = T

(2) -> (+ 1 1)
Value = 2

(2) ->
\end{verbatim}
Notice that the lisp expressions are not seen by the Axiom interpreter
and thus the expression numbers do not change.

It is also useful to know that when a lisp error occurs Axiom gives
you the choice of entering a lisp break loop or returning back to
the Axiom top level. The default is to return to the top level.
This can be changed by:
\begin{verbatim}
(1) -> 1/0
  >> Error detected within library code:
  division by zero
 
(1) -> )set break break
(1) -> 1/0
  >> Error detected within library code:
  division by zero
 
protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

Break.
Broken at FUNCALL. Type :H for Help.
BOOT>>:q
(1) ->
\end{verbatim}


The code in this file is useful for debugging the interpreter. If you
have a problem with a function, say [[|compColon|]], we find out what
file contains the code. In this case it is 
[[src/interp/compiler.boot.pamphlet]]. All of the pamphlet files for
the interpreter from the [[src/interp]] subdirectory will be extracted
as lisp source code in the [[int/interp]] subdirectory. Thus we want
the file [[int/interp/compiler.clisp]]. (Generally speaking [[.boot]]
files become [[.clisp]] files, for historical reasons).

The code in this file will allow you to trace every function in this
file with one command. There are two considerations. 

The first consideration is whether you want to trace compiled or
interpreted code.

If you want to trace the compiled code then just call the 
[[trace-file*]] functions. These functions expect a filename,
read the file looking for [[defuns]] and construct a proper call
to the [[trace]] macro.

If you want to load the interpreted code and then trace it call the
[[load-trace-file*]] functions.

The second consideration is whether you want regular trace output
or "noisy" trace output. 

The regular trace output uses the standard [[trace]] macro.

The "noisy" trace output uses [[:entry]] and [[:exit]] keywords
to attach output format functions.

So to trace interpreted [[compiler.boot]] functions you would:
\begin{verbatim}
)lisp (load-trace-file "int/interp/compiler.clisp")
\end{verbatim}
or the noisy version:
\begin{verbatim}
)lisp (load-trace-file-noisy "int/interp/compiler.clisp")
\end{verbatim}

To trace compiled [[compiler.boot]] functions you would:
\begin{verbatim}
)lisp (trace-file "int/interp/compiler.clisp")
\end{verbatim}
or the noisy version:
\begin{verbatim}
)lisp (trace-file-noisy "int/interp/compiler.clisp")
\end{verbatim}

\section{The trace function in GCL}
Example of tracing a function "fact" so that only the outermost call is traced.
\begin{verbatim}
(defun fact (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (1- n)))))

(defvar in-fact nil)

(trace (fact :declarations ((in-fact nil))
	     :cond
	     (null in-fact)
	     :entry
	     (progn
	       (setq in-fact t)
	       (princ "Here comes input ")
	       (cons 'fact arglist))
             :exit
             (progn (setq in-fact nil)
		    (princ "Here comes output ")
                    (cons 'fact values))))
\end{verbatim}
Example of tracing fact so that only three levels are traced
\begin{verbatim}
(trace (fact :declarations
	     ((fact-depth 0))
	     :cond

\section{load-trace-file}
The trace-file function expects a source file as its argument.
It reads the lisp forms in the file looking for and remembering
the package name. It looks for every [[defun]] form in the file
and wraps a call to [[trace]] around the form. The [[trace-file]]
function assumes that the file has already been loaded.

The load-trace-file function will load the file first. This is 
useful because you will get interpreted forms which gives more
debugging information.

\section{load-trace-file-noisy}
The [[trace-file-noisy]] function expects a source file as its argument.
It reads the lisp forms in the file looking for and remembering
the package name. It looks for every [[defun]] form in the file
and wraps a call to [[trace]] around the form. The [[trace-file-noisy]]
function assumes that the file has already been loaded.

The GCL [[trace]] macro accepts keyword arguments. We exploit that
fact to give a readable execution trace. The trace will look something
like:
\begin{verbatim}
1> (:ENTER firstFunction (arg arg arg...))
  2> (:ENTER secondFunction (arg arg arg...))
    3> (:ENTER thirdFunction (arg arg arg...))
    3> (:EXIT thirdFunction (result result ...))
  2> (:EXIT secondFunction (result result ...))
1> (:EXIT firstFunction (result result ...))
\end{verbatim}
It may be useful to define your own entry and exit forms.
On entry the GCL [[trace]] macro wraps a [[let]] form that 
binds the variable [[si::arglist]] to the list of arguments. 
On exit the [[trace]] macro binds [[si::values]].

The load-trace-file-noisy function will load the file first. This is 
useful because you will get interpreted forms which gives more
debugging information.

GCL optimizes function calling in a reversible way. The first call to

Subject: Re: lsp/Makefile.pamphlet

Bill,

I had a few typos in that Makefile.pamphlet for the windows patches
which I've now fixed. They should be on arch shortly.

In GCL if you have exact type information the function calling
can be reduced by quite a few instructions (possibly by 100
instructions or more if memory serves me). Normal function 
calling has to do type-casing. The exact type information allows
a good lisp implementation to elide this.

The best way to see this is to run disassemble on the function
before and after. I did a lot of this with the AKCL and CMUCL
implementations. In fact, CMUCL was so good that I could get

(+ a b)

to reduce to one instruction on the IBM RT with proper declarations.
Of course you have to declare it something like:

(the fixnum (+ (the fixnum a) (the fixnum b))) 

or some such. I believe some of the macros I wrote do a lot of
this kind of expansion. I also load proclaims.lisp into the image
so GCL function type information is available. 

Schelter and I worked quite a bit on speeding up function calling
as much as possible. If I remember correctly the fast-links code
will trade space (a link) for speedup.

If you look in src/boot you'll see a newly created file called
boot-proclaims.lisp which is part of my recent efforts to optimize
the system. I plan to push it as far as I can. Eventually the 
makefiles will automatically re-compile the lisp code to get the
optimization information and type optimization will be pushed
into the algebra code. I'm just not there yet.

I presume that

       @(cd ${GCLVERSION}/h ; \
         echo 3 applying EXTRAS patch to h/linux.defs ; \

is invoked by GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.5w but it should specify the
mingw patch, right?

----------

My build using Mike's sources just completed normally. It
built the databases and ran all of the tests. It finally
aborted trying to compile clef, but that is expected and
not needed for the Windows build.

In this version the )cd command works properly. So it
seems that Mike has already included a patch for that.
I will now delete the .o in the obj directory and rebuild
as you suggested before I put this new windows binary on
axiom-developer. I will be very impressed if this makes
Axiom eveb faster since it already seems fast to me under

I delete the *.o files from

  obj/windows/interp/*.o

and

  obj/windows/boot/*.o

Is that all? Then run make again. Correct?

The second build completed VERY quickly (about 5 minutes)
and the result was an AXIOMsys file that was about 1.4 Mb
larger and does seem to run faster. But I need a more
serious test. Is there a way to just run the test sequence?

Dear Bill:

Thanks again for all the suggestions you sent. However, I am fully occupied for
the rest of this week (end of term rush) and next, if not all the way to end of
the year! (This is due to an article I "should have" finished end of November).

I'll try to continue testing the Windows version when I get a moment to spare
(trouble is, I have not developed Tim's multi-tasking ability -- still a single
processor CPU :-(  )

Some of the Axiom related work involves the April conference Tim mentioned,
where the plan is to explore whether we can quickly write some Axiom package to
simulate Matlab functions that are used in our calculus sequence. I also have
some mathematica notebooks for a differential equations course (a kind of
package not done to Wolfram standard, but very usable by students as tutorials),
but I am afraid at least for the foreseeable future, transporting it to Axiom is
not possible. If you are interested, you may download this from my course web
site:

http://scisun.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~wyscc/Math391/DiffEqn.html

At CAISS, we believe that if we can get Axiom into the courses, we can get a
huge user base. But a prerequisite for that is a Windows version with easy user
interface. I think the user interface of Mathematica is way ahead, not just
because of the fancy fonts or layout or palettes, but also the style sheets and
PROGRAMMABLE Frontend. I used a lot of these features in my DiffEqn package.
There are of course many weaknesses (and strengths) in the design of
Mathematica.

Simply asking this location at install time is not good, as was already pointed
out that this default may not be known to a naive Windows user,  may not be
desirable by other users, and in network environment, may be mapped to various
drive letters.

Two possible solutions may work across all Windows platforms. The first is to
use an axiom.ini file in the c:\windows directory to store all user information
(one section per user on the machine) that includes any Linux environmental
variable, user directories, etc, and a global section to store function call
translations (like cat to type). This file is easily editable by a user, or be
protected in W2k or XP.  The second is to put the info in the Registry.

Either of the above suggestions will not have conflicts since the axiom.ini or
registry entries are local information only.

The axiom.ini file can reside anywhere, in particular in the installed axiom
directory. The registry is editable and while most naive users (like students)
will not venture to do so, it is not a difficult thing to do so when guided by
the guru.
Alternatively, a simple menu type program can be written to allow
"configuration" with actual changes to axiom.ini or the registry hidden from the
user.

As to the problem about path syntax, in order to be as portable as possible, we
may follow the method used by Mathematica. It breaks up a path into its
component as strings without the separators and then provides functions to piece
them back together according to the operating system. I have no trouble at all
transporting my Mathematica notebooks that involves paths across linux, windows,
and Macs or networks. Frequently used and more or less fixed paths can be
assigned to global variables that would be initialized at the start of the
program session. (For example, Mathematica has $InstallDirectory,
$PreferencesDirectory).  Axiom already has a FileNameCategory and FileName
domain with common facilities.

Looks good! I did a tla update of axiom--windows--1 and ran

as Mike's original.

Great.

So what bugs should we kill first? These are the ones
I know of so far:

1) )cd with no parameter still returns path error, but
   should be user's HOME directory. Should GCL expand ~
   as USERPROFILE on windows?.

   Note that )cd pathname now works and so does )cd .

2) Use of cat, rm, ls in BOOT must be replaced with lisp

3) Add NSIS installer script and build commands to Windows
   section of Makefile.pamphlet

4) Test sockets in GCL for Windows

5) Compile sman and graphics. What graphics API for Windows?
   We do not have X but is there a Windows compatible
   library? Can we support at least postscript file
   generation?

Anything else to start?

Axiom is a general purpose Computer Algebra system. It is useful for research
and development of mathematical algorithms. It defines a strongly typed,
mathematically correct type hierarchy. It has a programming language and a
built-in compiler.

Axioms homepage is at

http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/

Instructions to download Axiom for the various platforms, including linux and
MS Windows can be found at

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload

The licenses under which the various parts of Axiom are released can be found
at

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/Copyright

Since the wishlist 

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/WishList

is long, we decided to provide bounties, i.e. small amounts of money, for
people willing to implement some features. Among others, we need people who
would like to 

* integrate a LaTeX-rendering engine into our Wiki
  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction

* know how to resurrect the connection to the alternative compiler Aldor

* know enough Lisp to make graphics work on MS Windows

humpf. I started my build at 2:30am and it's only at layer 9

I believe this will also impact the underlying lisp since
there are issues such as truename does not handle ~ properly.
Perhaps we can wait until this one is solved by GCL? 

>   Note that )cd pathname now works and so does )cd .

In your version or the --patch-5 version? I can't test
it until the compile completes which won't be until
later this afternoon (auuggghhh.. 12 hour builds!)

>2) Use of cat, rm, ls in BOOT must be replaced with lisp

This might be a good place to start. There is a new file
src/interp/port.lisp.pamphlet which would be a good place
to put this code as I'm sure every lisp will do it differently.

>3) Add NSIS installer script and build commands to Windows
>   section of Makefile.pamphlet

I'd do this first. We could probably do a 'make package' where
the 'package:' stanza was target specific. Thus on windows
it would build using the installer and on linux it would build
using tgz. 

The reason to do this first is that there is expertise about
how to build the package which no one needs to learn. Makefiles
are a very good way to encode this expertise so "it just works".

I looked at this for a short while. This is going to be a long,
hard problem for every system. There is the possibililty that
we could use TK, which is an interpreted X-windows like front end.
Perhaps there is a windows version of TK. 

We do need to figure out the socket stuff. Ideally we could
leverage the effort by figuring out how to do sockets from 
GCL. Once we figure that out it should be possible to move
the socket code out of C and into lisp. This would make Axiom
more portable in general. Since we're going to struggle with
this anyway we might as well do it right.

>
>Anything else to start?

On Windows the lisp compiles are getting complains that '-mcpu='
is deprecated. Use '-mtune=' or '-march='. Are you seeing the same 
message?

The xmaxima frontend and openmath plotting are written in TCL/TK.  I
personally don't care for them, and most of our folk dislike messing
with the code IIRC, but they do get the job done. 

A couple questions to help bring the problem into focus:

a)  Do you want to impliment the exact plotting abilities of the
current axiom code in Windows?

b)  If so, are there any native windows plotting programs from which
the effort could start?  (Essentially, use the code as a guide on how
to do various things in Windows, and reimpliment axiom's graphics
exactly.)

c)  If not, what about using a library like VTK (which is cross
platform) to impliment the functionality but maybe not the exact look?
VTK has maintainers of its own and by all accounts I have seen is
extremely powerful and polished.  http://public.kitware.com/VTK/ 
Unfortunately no lisp bindings though - it would have to be FFI or
socket communications.

d)  A third course is to use some third party program for plotting on
Windows, which might not be as nice as Axiom's plotting for X systems
but will provide at least some functionality.  Maxima's current default
choice on all platforms is gnuplot - we want to make something better
somday, but will most likely need to do it ourselves.

I strongly, strongly disagree.  The programmability of the front-end is
one of the biggest drawbacks of Mathematica.  They have a programming
language with: list-based, object oriented, functional programming, and
user-interface programming, not to mention thousands of mathematical
objects and operations.  Thus they have the most complicated programming
language in existance, and with it the inherent complexity, bugs, and
learning curve.  This also forces them into a backwards-compatability
nightmare forced by early design decisions.

If a programmable user interface is desired (e.g. writing worksheets for
students) it should be decoupled from axiom itself so that bugs can be
isolated, complexity controlled, and interaction of various parts
understood.  I think texmacs + command-line math plugins, emacs +
command-line plug-ins, and the latexwiki/web interface we're developing
are all good examples of this.  Programmability of the user interface
should be targetted to these separate, external applications.

Eventually I would also like to see a Mozilla/Gecko interface, with
Axiom emitting MathML that is rendered by Mozilla.  Scripting of the
interface can be acheived by DHTML, CSS, and javascript, in ways that
are quickly becoming familiar to a wide array of web-developers and
others.

I discovered today the feature of zwiki which creates a "chat" basically

I have long wanted an interface that would enable me to communicate with
remote collaborators and send/receive math.   It should be trivial to
plug latexwiki into this chat (I'll try it later).  It would also be
cool to have a shared axiom session...

Up to now I was thinking of a standalone plugin for an existing chat app

No, since there has not been any agreement, neither on the bounties themselves,
nor on the pricing.

There are several issues:

* we don't have too much money to spend, thus I regard the bounties rather as
  a way to say thank you. If you happen to live in a country where 100$ are a
  fortune, even better. (In fact, I think we should specifically target such
  countries. Mathematica and Maple cost a fortune, I don't know about Mupad.)

* I dare say that it will be very difficult to make conditions precise, under
  which some submitted work is "good enough". Therefore I argue that "good
  enough" means, that the "heavy lifting" is done, i.e., the code works. This
  is another reason to set the prices at a not too high value. I think we
  should allow ourselves to negotiate here: if some submitter says: "Here's the
  code, it works. If you want some really good documentation, I'll ask for
  another 100 bucks.", I think this will work better than insisting on
  documentation right away. Furthermore, I think that maths will be even more
  difficult to judge than some integration work.

 > Also, has it been decided who are the foundation members?  Am I one?

I think so, yes.

Sorry, I would but I can't IRC from were I'am at right now.

Briefly %pi is a macro for pi()
        %e is a macro for exp(1)

See

)display op pi

)display op exp

Examining the differences between %pi and %e in Axiom
takes you quite quickly down into the details of types
and conversions... worth the trip, I think!

It is important to remember these distinctions:

:: is a conversion from one type to another

@ specifies a desired target type

$ specifies exactly what package to call

In Axiom the type of pi() is Pi. This might seem strange
at first until you think of the importance of %pi in many
areas of mathematics. It is convenient to have it's special
properties encoded in a special type. Try

  )show Pi

to see all of the operations defined in this domain.
Notice that expressions like

  %pi+1

are also of type Pi.

%e on the other hand is of type Expression Integer.

We can convert %pi to the same type as %e

  pI:Expression Integer:=%pi

But then objects of type Expression Integer cannot
be converted to Float (in general)

  pI::Float

You would think that we could still do

  pI@Float

to request the target type Float by Axiom says
no.

In fact I think that it is strange that Axiom
allows

  pi()::Float

but it turns out that Float does have a function called
by pi()$Float since

  Float has TRANFUN

etc. etc.

Exercise: what is this?

  pi$Float

Have fun!

I don't really understand why this should make sense. After all, neither

asin(1)::FLOAT

asin(1)::HACKPI

I suppose you are disagreeing with the "way ahead" claim.  I am talking mainly
about what CAN be done, not how easy it is done nor how elegantly it is done,
with the Frontend programming. To do what I did (mainly in 1998-2000) in the
DiffEqn package is very difficult, if not impossible, say with existing Maple
worksheet. 

> The programmability of the front-end is
> one of the biggest drawbacks of Mathematica.  

Why? The Frontend is a separate program from the Kernel of Mathematica. Most
users may not even be aware of its programmability. By programmability of the
Frontend, I mean one can dynamically update a notebook using Mathematica
commands (like inserting, deleting, editing, copying results or groups of cells
into a notebook when the command is started from another notebook, with its
source in yet some other notebook).

I don't disagree with the above. Mathematica derives its "power" from such
complexity, just as Axiom derives its "power" (in different ways) from other
complexities. The problems you described are not unique to Mathematica.

This (separation), I agree, is desirable; but as I said, Mathematica's Frontend
is separate from the Kernel even if their language syntaxes are similar. The
user interface has to, by necessity, interact with computation through input and
output. From a 2D "scratchpad" point of view, Mathematica's Frontend allows one
to go back and edit a command, wrap a previous command to perform more
computation, etc. You cannot do that as easily in Axiom, Maple, or Matlab.

Sure, that's coming RSN. Of course, new languages keep coming to solve old
problems. In hindsight, you may say Mathematica is behind the times (but they do
have Webmathematica), and remember, MathML and javascript weren't there.
Backward compatibility is important (destroying that is a sure way to stimulate
the economy). And would you say that mixing MathML, DHTML, CSS, javascript,
web-browsers, texmacs, emacs, latexwiki, with Axiom's lisp-based,
type-hierarchies, procedural programming, BOOT, interpreter language, compiler
language, maybe Aldor, thousands of domains and operations, not to mention all
the coercions, is easy?

I am neither a fan nor a critic of any of the systems. I use whatever is most
suitable and available for the tasks at hand.

Subject: Re: Beta Announcement / Final Questions

Please excuse the intolerable amount of spam.

Since I have the OK of root, I'm going to announce Axiom Beta today
evening. Two questions remain:

1) Frederic suggested, that we should continue with the version numbers of
   commercial Axiom. He stated that the last version was 2.3, so I see three
   possibilities:

   - we stick with 1.0 Beta, since axiom is free now and that's a major change

   - we continue with 3.0 Beta, since axiom is free now and that's a major
     change, but there are only tiny changes to functionality.

   - we continue with 2.4 Beta, since axiom is free now and there are only tiny
     changes to functionality.

2) Are there any chances

   - that the patches from savannah plus the mysterious patch to bug #5977
     x^2+1::DMP([x],INT) are applied to axiom--main--1

   - that axiom--main--1 will be copied into cvs 

   - that binaries with the patches applied exist in the Download section

   today evening or tommorow morning?

3) Bob, if you can make up your mind about your wish regarding the bounty, I'll
   include this in the release-notes, or you can do it yourself, if you prefer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are no reponses regarding 1), I'll take 3.0 Beta as versioning number.

If one of the points in 2) would be possible, I'll wait with the release until
tomorrow and adapt it accordingly.

Thanks for all the great work,

When this is all wrapped up, would someone kindly point me to a
minimal set of gcl windows patches?  We can then role out a 2.6.6.

Greetigns!  Does Windows not recognize the ~ expansion in MSYS?  If it
does, and gcl is not picking it up for some reason, I'd like to get
the truename to work.  What about (truename (si::getenv "HOME"))?

How did you configure the first time?  In any case, this run found a
bfd.h header which has an intelligible boolean syntax.  Would be
interested in the value of HAVE_BFD_BOOLEAN set by configure here.
Just in case you did configure with -disable-statsysbfd
--enable-locbfd the last time and somehow you still don't have false
and true, please do

cd o && cpp -I../h fat_string.h

And send me the output.  You should see what I do in this case:

# 113 "../h/bfd.h"
typedef enum bfd_boolean {false, true} boolean;
# 170 "../h/bfd.h"


The problem below is entirely separate -- configure could not
determine that your readline library already defined
rl_compentry_func_t.

Here is the test:

	AC_CHECK_LIB(readline,rl_completion_matches,
			AC_DEFINE(HAVE_DECL_RL_COMPLETION_MATCHES)
			AC_DEFINE(HAVE_RL_COMPENTRY_FUNC_T),,)

And here is the code in gcl_readline.d leading to the collision:

#ifndef HAVE_RL_COMPENTRY_FUNC_T
/* same here */
typedef char *rl_compentry_func_t(const char *, int);
#endif

My guess is that you've run configure without your /opt/csw/include
directory in your C_INCLUDE_PATH environment.  configure probably
could not find readline.h at all, and you may have had to instruct GCL
as to its location explicitly.  

My suggestion -- either add --disable-readline to the configure flags
to get quickly beyond this point, or 

1) start with a plain gcl-2.6.5 with only the patches from the errata
   page applied.

2) Do something like the following (in analogy with Mac OSX, which
   also has non-traditional locations for installed software:)

  export PATH=/opt/csw/bin:$PATH
  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/csw/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
  export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/csw/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/csw/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

        (probably don't need the below)
  export CPPFLAGS="-no-cpp-precomp"
  ulimit -s 8192

3) ./configure --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd && make

4) send me the output from 3) if failures persist.

P.S. I think you are doing this already, but in my meager experience
with Solaris, one uses gcc for most free software projects like gcl,
but must use Solaris ld to link for reasons not completely clear to
me.  Most environments are setup for this to my knowledge.  Might want
to check which cc, which gcc, gcc -v, and which ld.

Take care,

Yes, the default assumption in the GNU configure toolchain, to my
feeble understanding, is that such locations are specified in the
user's environment before running configure.  Perhaps we need a readme
to this effect.  PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH, LIBRARY_PATH, and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and possibly GCC_EXEC_PREFIX are the important ones.

Greetings!

This is a failure of the logic configure uses to determine your
boolean syntax in your bfd library.  configure knows about the
following two possibilities:

#ifdef HAVE_BFD_BOOLEAN
#define MY_BFD_BOOLEAN bfd_boolean
#define MY_BFD_FALSE FALSE
#define MY_BFD_TRUE TRUE
#else
#define MY_BFD_BOOLEAN boolean
#define MY_BFD_FALSE false
#define MY_BFD_TRUE true
#endif


Here is the test:

	AC_MSG_CHECKING(for useable bfd_boolean)
	AC_TRY_RUN([#define IN_GCC
		    #include <bfd.h>
		    bfd_boolean foo() {return FALSE;}
		    int main() {return 0;}],
		AC_MSG_RESULT(yes) 
		AC_DEFINE(HAVE_BFD_BOOLEAN),
		AC_MSG_RESULT(no),
		AC_MSG_RESULT(no))

So apparently you are defaulting to the second case, but false and
true are not defined either.  

Perhaps you could report the prototype of your 

    bfd_link_hash_traverse

function in your bfd.h?  

In general, I recommend your first attempts should be to configure
with

--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd.

This will use GCL's own snapshot of bfd, which is known to work on
sparc (and elsewhere).

If you get a chance to post your full configure and make output, I'd
be appreciative, as well as any changes in addition to the patches you
felt the need to make.

Take care, and thanks so much for your feedback!

There are actually two issue here, argument type and number checking,
and passing arguments via the lisp stack.  Passing arguments, even if
untyped, via the C stack is much faster.  All the better of course if
you can type the arguments too.  The beauty of GCL's fast-link
mechanism, is, IMHO, that you can have your cake and eat it too --
when enabled, you get function calling at C speed via a function
pointer, when disabled, you can push the arguments to the lisp stack
for inspection via the lisp debugger.  

It appears that the code for this has evolved somewhat over time.
Tim's memory might be the best archive left in this world :-).  There
should be no reason, AFAICT, that any function should not at least be
proclaimed with generic object arguments at compile time to enable the
fast-linking function format, though it is still necessary at present
to either do this by hand or run the automatic sys-proclaims
generation as a separate step.  The latter will always be more
efficient than a 'proclaim-as-you-go' strategy, as all such
information will be present at the beginning.  But the two are not
incompatible, and the former will transparently catch many of the most
common cases where all calls are within the same file.  This should at
least straighten out certain long-standing misconceptions when
benchmarking GCL, as it has been difficult for me to impress upon the
benchmarker that GCL has been designed with the assumption that the
sys-proclaims would be autogenerated before compilation for maximum
efficiency.

I'd like to put something like this in to 2.7.0 time permitting.  Also
on the agenda is typed optional argument passing, and tail recursion
to functions with optional arguments.

With Pauls' help, and with the help of his fantastic random compiler
tester, we've been putting in automatic type propagation into CVS
head.  For example:

COMPILER>(defun foo (x y) (declare ((integer -1000 1000) x y)) (+ x (* 2 y) (* 3 (1+ (+ x y))) (- (max 4 y) (- 2 x y))))

FOO

I think the major tradeoff with fast-linking is that one has no
debugging information via the lisp stack.  Amazingly, this can be
toggled at runtime.

I think the Debian package does the extra pass now -- when this
changes in the official tree, please let me know so I can remove the
extra pass here.

Subject: RE: [Gcl-devel] Re: Minor bugs

Camm, Tim,

I don't think these rounding and truncation problems are
a lisp issue as such. They are a result of an assumption
in Axiom about the behavour of the shift operation on
signed integers which is not compatible with the current
lisp standard. Basically Axiom expects an unsigned shift
function but the standard lisp function call is extending
the sign arithmetically instead of "logically". Details are
on Savannah bug and patch lists. There is some discussion
of the efficiency of the proposed patch in the axiom-
developer email list archive of a little more than a year
ago.

The patch I submitted (but haven't yet found time to move
to the axiom--main--1 archive, provides the logical shift
by check the sign and changing things accordingly. This is
check is pretty fast, but it occurs at such a deep level
that even a little inefficiency could affect computationally
intensive programs. In the medium/long term it would be more
efficient to directly map many of the numerical functions in
float.spad (and a few other places) to their high level
equivalents in lisp.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I like your idea to begin official release version numbers
for open source Axiom at 3.0. My reasons::

- AXIOM-3-oh has a nice ring to it

- Tim likes to talk about the "30 year horizon" ... Axiom=30

- Version 3.0 implies some maturity but not too much maturity.
  Certainly Axiom  can claim that since even though a lot of
  things about the new release are new.

Unlikely but I just might be able to squeeze in a few patches

That's a great idea. Even if Bob doesn't make up his mind, :)
I think you should do this with your first notices tonight.
You can be deliberately vague pointing to the current list as
examples and saying that although funds are limited, specific
tasks are negotiable and proposals will be considered from
all interested parties. ... etc.

I think you should proceed as planned tonight. There are
enough useable Linux binary versions available (although
not all up to date nor well documents) and the Windows
binary installer is in pretty good shape. I expect that
large proportion of new people interested that you might
reach will be Windows users.

I any case I expect we willing finally be in position to
"release often", as one should expect with an open source
project.

Indeed, all around! This will be a great way to start the
next year's Axiom effort. Hey, another reason for 3.0 -
this will be my 3 year with the project.

My lack of experience with Axiom is a major drawback.  I cannot even
readily identify what needs to be done.  I thought a bit about a QFT
module (a la FeynCalc) but by the time I got deep enough into that to
understand how to write the requirements, I'd have the bounty
half-completed...  Therefore I propose the following text for my bounty:

    $100 for any new mathematical Domain, extension, or algorithm.  The
    submitted pamphlet code must be at least 500 lines and include test
    cases and examples.  Proposals should be sent in advance of code to
    the axiom developer's mailing list: list to
    verify eligibility of your idea.

Comments?

I will likely put up further bounties for QFT pieces as I come to
understand the work involved.

That looks weird to me. What I think what you normally
would want to do is to just specify the target type:

  %e@FLOAT
  %pi@FLOAT

This provides an approximate floating point representation
for both e and pi.

I often have this feeling too when I look closely at the
Axiom type system. Many things strike me as strange at
first. Later I sometimes discover that there is/was some
good but poorly documented rational for the design.

This just convinces me again that Tim emphasis on
documentation documentation documentation is the right
one.

Apparently there is no asin function in Pi. We need to
know what "they" were thinking when they they invented
the idea that pi and expressions involving pi ought to
be belong to their own domain. What was the intention
of this design?
 
What is the purpose of the domain HACKPI ?? 

There might be some relevant comments in the spad code
for PI.

Dr. Sutor's encouragement means a lot to me!

Now that we have the Windows version off the ground,
I think the book should be the "next big push".

Dear Meino,

unfortunately I'm not the export, but maybe downgrading to 2.14 helps. (I have
libbfd-2.14.90.0.5.so ...)

I'm absolutely sure that there is a solution for libbfd-2.15, too, but I don't
know it. You'd have to wait for a more authoritative answer from Camm.

I suppose you got the source from savannah?

Good luck,

Meino,

This is a GCL build problem. I think the usual solution that
Camm would suggest is to repeat the build specifying the
locbfd option in the GCL configure step. You can do that by
editing the file lsp/Makefile.pamphlet. This causes GCL to
build it's own library rather than depending on the one supplied
by the system. Check the axiom-developer and/or gcl email
archives for details.

Bill Page.

Bill,

 for what patterns/keywords should I look for in those mailing lists?

 With "gcl", "build" I got far too many hits.

 Could you give a little more detailed hellp other than "search in

Dear Bill,

maybe this is the point where we could subscribe axiom-developer to mathaction,
i.e., any time mathaction is changed, a note is sent to
list.

Mathaction is pretty stable now, and because of the preview feature and the
possibility of using an external editor, most changes happen in one or two
steps.

I would strongly encourage you to take this step.

Martin

PS: Would it be possible to have the bibliography from 

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/bibliography_view

moved to mathaction? Of course I could do it by hand, but it seems easier to me
if you'd just do a "cp", if possible.

Hello,

I recall a more recent posting from Camm:

  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-11/msg00098.html

This posting gives a few patches to the gcl sources which should allow
it to compile with respect to a recent bfd. These patches involve the
precise files and bfd structures which caused Meino's build to choke.
Apparently the patches are available on gcl's errata page as well.

There is still the option of configuring gcl to build against its own
bfd library. In lsp/Makefile.pamphlet, about line 340, you will find
the following stanza starting as:

 ========================================================================
<<gclConfigureMake>>=
        @(cd ${GCLVERSION} ; \
        ./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-statsysbfd	--enable-maxpage=128*1024 ; \
 ========================================================================

Where you can change the options to configure. You could try
`--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd' thus:

 ========================================================================
<<gclConfigureMake>>=
        @(cd ${GCLVERSION} ; \
        ./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd \
	--enable-maxpage=128*1024 ; \
 ========================================================================

Cheers,
Steve

Yes, isn't that preview great! It makes the ZWiki interface
much more usable in conjunction with subscriptions. I really
like how it is possible to run Axiom and/or Reduce to do some
test or other and then either save the results as a web page
for others to see or not depending on the results.

moved to mathaction? Of course I could do it by hand, but
it seems easier to me if you'd just do a "cp", if possible.

Do you mean move it as a static web page?

Right now on plone it is managed as a database application
under Plone. As far as I know this I know this is not currently
possible under ZWiki alone.

As a static page some of the other functions would also not
work such as the bibtex download. If it is just one big page
then the wiki search would not be of much use.

What's wrong with leaving it where it is?

Subject: axiom--main--1--patch-15

I've changed the top level Makefile.pamphlet to include a new per-system
variable called GCLOPTS. This variable is intended to allow simple
command line changes for GCL builds. The default value is:

GCLOPTS="--enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-statsysbfd --enable-maxpage=128*1024"

but like all of the other system specific options this can be changed on 
the make command line with:

make GCLOPTS='"--enable-maxpage=128*1024 --enable-vssize=65536*2"'

Note that in this case you MUST include both the single and double quotes.
The single quotes escape the double quotes in the shell so that the double
quotes are actually seen as part of the GCLOPTS variable value. Since the
options contain spaces we need to add the double quotes.

This has been checked in as axiom--main--1--patch-15.

Subject: stable release schedule

There are some differences between the axiom--main--1 branch 
and the Savannah CVS.

While, in general, it is not vital that Savannah (where the bravest
users get sources) track the axiom-main branch (where developers work), 
I suggest that we consider setting up an expectation of a 'release
schedule'. Since open source tends to follow the philosophy of 
'release early, release often' we should follow that.

My suggestion is that we bring axiom--main--1 up to a tested
release version as of the 1st of every month. That way the Savannah
version is at most a month behind the latest merged version in main.
Plus this will give developers a target to shoot for when developing
features and an idea of when the merged versions will emerge.

Comments?

OK, I didn't realize that there is functionality involved :-) No, it does not
make sense to move it then. The "emotionale" was: since it gets so many hits, I
would like to have it on mathaction :-)

I like the idea (not that I'm qualified to have an opinion) but I would
suggest that the release period be three months rather than one.  In
the case of Maxima at least, it always seems that whenever we get ready
for a release, we spend lots of time squashing problems that crop up on
machines with slightly different configurations (Windows is especially
bad - we have had a case or two of the Zombie Bug, where it keeps
coming back when we kill it.)

My rational works like this:  since preparing a quasi-stable release
involves many things, including testing underlying lisps, new
underlying system software, fixing whatever won't work with newer
versions of both, rince and repeat a couple times, etc. I would say you
might want a period longer than 1 month to work on features and core
improvements without worrying about practical stuff.  Perhaps it won't
be as bad as I think, but I worry a little that a month might be just
enough time for all the little dumb things to get fixed, only to have
to start all over again as the underlying software gets updated and
more little dumb things pop up.

Anyway, just a thought.  If the savannah version is not always expected
to build and run smoothly, then it might not be as bad.

Martin,

> to mathaction, i.e., any time mathaction is changed, a note

Ok, *I think* I have set this up. It was a bit awkward to do it
because of the "email reply required" type of authentication
that is used by mailman. In order to post a message to axiom-
developer the email address of the sender has to be subscribed
to the email list. So I first have to subscribe mathaction to
axiom-developer. Mailman sends an email to the address that you
specify (in this case MathAction) and it
expects the receiver of the message to do something to confirm
the address. Normally email sent to MathAction
will be appended to a page on the MathAction website. To confirm
the mathaction email address as a subscriber to axiom-developer
I first had to temporily re-direct the mathaction email address
on axiom-developer.org to my own email address. Then I could
confirm the request and have (apparently) managed to get mathaction
subscribed.

But there is a potential problem. If the mathaction email address
is also subscribed to the MathAction wiki - what we really want
to do - then that could create a nasty email loop since anything
sent to the axiom-developer email list by the MathAction website
would be echoed back to MathAction and trigger another outgoing
email.

It turns out there are some options that I can specify for
subscriptions to the axiom-developer list, one of these is to
disable echoing of emails to the original sender. This would
prevent the loop but it would result in every message to the
axiom-developer email list to be duplicated since a posting
would be sent to MathAction who would update some webpage on
the site and then send the changes to the site subscribers
one of which is mathaction on the axiom-developer email list.

I have instead choosen to disable all emails to the mathaction
address (on permantent vacation :) but the address remains
subscribed.

So this is what I have set up:

1) A user with the name Relay from MathAction is subscribed
to the axiom-developer email list using the email address
MathAction. Email delivery to that address
is disabled. (I hope that this does not also disable posting
of messages by that address!)

2) A user named axiom-developer is subscribed to the MathAction
website using the email address list

What I expect to happen:

1) If a change or comment is made to the MathAction web site
by someone, that will generate an email to the subscribers to
MathAction, one of which will go to list.
It should be recognized by mailman as coming from a subscriber
with email address MathAction

2) The email from MathAction will in turn be distributed by the
email server (mailman) at nongnu.org to all the other subscribers
on the axiom-developer email list.

However...

I have just made a test change on MathAction. I received a notice
of the change at my own email address since I am a subscriber
(you must of received it too), but since I am also a subscriber
to axiom-developer, I expected to see the notice again a short
time later echoed from that list. But so far it has not shown
up. Sometimes postings do seem to take a long time, so I
will continue to wait. In the meantime I am sending this message
to axiom-developer only and I will see which of these messages
arrives back in my inbasket first.

As Tim always say: There is no such thing as a simple job ... :)

I think that this is a good idea. There is one thing which should go along with
this schedule however: *what* we want to target at. Whether the period will be
one or three months does not seem so important to me. We should, however, take
into account major holidays: Christmas, end of term in January (or is that an
Austriacism?), Easter, end of term in June...

So, to fill this with a little life, I'd like to have the first "real" release
just before February with

* all the known (build and algebra) patches integrated
  By the way: whats the status of bug #5977 x^2+1::DMP([x],INT)

While we are at it, here's another idea: I think it would be sensible to divide
Axiom into two pieces: the Algebra and the rest. If it would be that way, we

hyperdoc, various lisp implementations and one common branch algebra.

Unless there are legal reasons to to include it, or it takes massive
amounts of space, I think it's easier for the end user to have
everything already there.  Pretty much all available Maxima code (with
one exception I'm aware of) is now included in cvs.

(Caveot - having high speed internet and a (relatively) good sized hard
disk, making a file a meg or two larger doesn't tend to faze me at all.
 This is not universally true, so I guess the question is who our
audience is and what would best serve their needs.  I would be very
interested if, for this first release, both Axiom itself and
Axiom+TeXmacs were packaged as stand-alone exe installs and we could
see which would be more popular.)

Um.  Shouldn't the code be modular enough to make this unnecessary?

Oh, I get it.  Tim, you're probably the one to best answer this - isn't
the windows branch temporary until the main codebase can build on all
branches without trouble?  Or are there Windows changes that cannot be
folded back into main?  In that case, I agree with Martin.

I've never had to coordinate something like that.  Maxima's release
schedule is basically "when we're ready" and anybody who wants to look
at the current state of things can check out cvs.  Also, history
teaches that whenever we put together a release there tend to be
non-math issues that pop up.  But if Axiom is checked regularly (i.e.
once every few weeks) on all platforms, perhaps there won't be too many
issues with making periodic releases.  That's what I'm not sure about.

Subject: Re: stable release schedule

re: monthly vs three-month releases

The way Axiom is now being developed allows us to have various 
branches "release" at different times. Currently there are about
10 branches running in parallel. So for a change to the windows
branch we would see many changes that are not reflected in main.

Eventually a version of windows passes tests and will get a tag.
This tagged version will eventually be merged into main while the
windows branch continues to develop.

The main would get tested and then published to savannah.

The key issue is that "small, system independent" changes and bug
fixes get pushed out on a monthly basis but larger efforts have
their own branches and get pushed out after passing tests. So 
developers in the windows branch are not under any pressure to
publish on any given month but the savannah cvs won't have to wait
for quick fixes.

The downside is that I get to test-and-release frequently but I'm
testing constantly anyway. The upsides are that savannah is up to date
and I don't have pressure in mid-month to "get this fix out immediately".

So even though savannah gets updated monthly for the next several months
there will be no windows support in the release. However the linux
support for hyperdoc won't have to wait (once I get it to work, of course).

Three-month release cycles seem to feel too long to me. There would be
great pressure to fix various known problems well before the three
months is up. And missing a single release means that a simple fix
could take 6 months to reach savannah. The world moves much faster
than that and we need to polish our process so it works smoothly
and cleanly.

Traditionally Axiom has built many versions from the same sources.
I don't see any reason to change this and it will require a bit of
work so it's unlikely to happen.

Ideally the end user should only have to type 'make' and we take
care of all of the magic. Else what are magicians for?

Camm,

As far as I know the list is final. There are only 4 patches that
relate to windows and I think they are only fixing two problems.
The first problem is the makedir function and the second problem
had to do with wildcard expansion or some such.

There is still a known problem with HOME/truename/~ expansion.

Likely there will be more patches as we begin to investigate
socket support for graphics/sman but noone is there yet.

Well, it wasn't quite so easy ...

I (via the re-directed mathaction email address) received the
follow bounce message from the axiom-developer mail list:

The reason is that ZWiki is using the Bcc: email field to send
it's email to subscribers. For security reasons (I guess) mailman
rejects messages that it receives only via the Bcc field. As a
temporary work-a-round I have changed MathAction to us Cc:
instead. This has the side effect that the list of subscribers
email addresses are visible to other subscribers. But right
now with only 4 subscribers that is not much of a problem.
Anyway, if we can forward through axiom-developer, then for
most people there would be little reason to subscribe directly
to MathAction, except for page-specific subscriptions.

While looking at the issue of connecting the axiom-developer

that I must have missed earlier when subscribing to this

  It is possible to tell the mailing list software to
  check if you were also on the To: or Cc: list of a

  duplicates!

To do this go to

  http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/options/axiom-developer

Fill in your email address and the password that you choose
when you subscribed to the list (not your email system password)
and click 'Login'.

At the bottom of the page look for the option

  "Avoid duplicate copies of messages?"

Click on "yes" and then 'Submit my Changes'. Clicking
"Set globally" will make this effective on all email list
to which you are subscribed.

And that's it. No more duplicates.

Tim,

On Friday, December 17, 2004 8:14 PM you asked:

The MathAction wiki has the feature that anyone can "subscribe"
to the whole web site or to individual pages on the site. If
anyone updates or comments on a page on MathAction then all
subscribers receive a notice by email.

As Martin Ruby and I discussed some time ago, it is often seen
as awkward to subscribe in multiple places for the same project
so most people subscribe only once: one of the mailing lists.

MathAction has the potential to greatly facilitate communication
by allowing users to write equations in LaTeX and to execute
Axiom (and Reduce) commands to illustrate some point. But
currently it is still being used as if it were an 1-way only
medium. Recently I upgrade the wiki software to the newest
release of ZWiki that allows one to "preview" the result of
editing changes to a page before committing it to the website.

So for example you pick an exist page containing some Axiom
commands, click Edit and make some changes, correct a mistake,
etc. When you click Preview, you will see the output of Axiom
and other contents of the page nicely formatted as it would
appear to others *if* you decide to click Save. If you don't
want to save, you can just cancel.

When you click Save, any subscribers will be notified by
email of the change you made.

What Martin suggested this morning is that now that we have
this preview function most things that people actually save
will be things that will be of interest to others. Therefore
it makes sense that a notice be sent to all subscribers to
the axiom-developer mailing list, not just to the subscribers
to MathAction wiki. This way we hope that the number of

Dear Bill,

Thanks for your effort. However, there are some things I don't understand at

Is this really true? If yes, we should either change it or keep it in mind for
the next release! It is not very nice if you have a question and want to ask
and the mailman tells you "subscribe first!" Also, if we could change this, all
the problems you describe hereafter would vanish...

This paragraph I do not understand. The mathaction email adress is
MathAction, so subscribing this to mathaction would mean
that any change on mathaction will send a message to
MathAction. What for?

   On all Unix/Linux systems the most recent version of TeXmacs is pre-configured to automatically interface with Axiom provided that Axiom is "installed":AxiomDownload and AXIOMsys is accessible at the command line (must be in the path). The current interface for Axiom has some known limitations when formatting long mathematical expressions.

   This new interface program is also recommended for use in cygwin. To check that you are using the new program, in a cygwin shell enter the command::

      $ which tm_axiom

   If the response is::

      /cygdrive/c/Program Files/axiom/mnt/windows/bin/tm_axiom.exe

   (where the default location 'Program Files' might be different) then you are using the new version. Otherwise make sure you delete or rename the older version of tm_axiom and try the 'which' command again.

   A new version of the Axiom stylesheet 'axiom.ts' is available in Axiom for Windows which improves the formatting of Axiom output. The new stylesheet is included automatically if you install the updated version of TeXmacs for Windows from the Axiom website "here":http://page.axiom-developer.org/wintexmacs-1.0.4.4.exe

   Otherwise to obtain this stylesheet, use Windows file manager to replace the existing file in TeXmacs::

      c:\Program Files\wintexmacs\TeXmacs\plugins\axiom\packages\session\axiom.ts

   with the file of the same name found in Axiom for Windows::

      /cygdrive/c/Program Files/axiom/mnt/windows/axiom.ts

   On cygwin the file 'axiom.ts' is located in the directory::

      cd /usr/share/TeXmacs/plugins/axiom/packages/session

   Overwrite existing stylesheet with the new stylesheet file::

      cp /cygdrive/c/Program Files/axiom/mnt/windows/axiom.ts .

I am sorry I was not clear.

1) Yes, MathAction is the email address of
   the MathAction web site. If you receive an email from MathAction
   it will appear to have originated from this address. If you
   reply or send a message to this address *and* if you are subscribed
   to MathAction, then MathAction will add the contents of the
   email to as a comment to the page given by the name in [  ] in
   the subject of the email.

2) I have subscribed the axiom-developer mailing list to the
   MathAction web site. Now all change notices will also be sent
   to the mailing list.

3) I have subscribed MathAction to the
   axiom-developer mailing list. This is necessary if I expect
   MathAction to be able to post it's notices on the mailing list.

   But I do not want the axiom-developer mailing list to send it's
   messages to the mathaction email address because then MathAction
   would treat that as a new comment on one of it's web pages and
   that would trigger another notice to be sent, ad infinitum. So
   I must tell the axiom-developer mailing list not to send
   MathAction such notices even though MathAction is subscribed
   to the list. (I need to be a one-way only subscriber).

In fact, this is all set up now and appears to be working. I even
(with Tim Daly's help) managed to change the configuration of the
axiom-developer email list so that it will accept emails via the
Bcc list. So in the end I did not have to change this to a Cc list
and everything is working on MathAction the way it was before I
set this up.

Please try using MathAction with it setup like this and let me
know if it works the way you had in mind.

 Ok, I did the build with the two changes and it works well.

 I installed it with:

   sudo make INSTALL=/usr/axiom COMMAND=/usr/bin/xiom install

 as described in the README
 
 and typed

   xiom

 on the commandline, which gaves me back this one:

   /usr/bin/xiom: line 7: /usr/axiom/mnt//bin/clef: No such file or directory

 The  I looked into that place and found:

Meino,

Notice the error message

                                         ^^
                                       two slashes?


but clef exists as we can see from your message

>    -rwxr-xr-x   ....  34188 Dec 18 10:55 /usr/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/clef

it appears that your $AXIOM shell variable contained a trailing slash

When I look at your second message I see:

Here the contents of /usr/bin/xiom

>  AXIOM=/usr/axiom/mnt/

so if you remove the trailing slash from the AXIOM variable all
should work properly.

It is probably not obvious from the line folding of the
original email, but what you are quoting here is actually the
old version (leading minus '-' sign) of the instructions. The
new version appears immediately after this without any minus
signs. This type of notice is automatically generated by
MathAction when a page is updated. In most cases it is probably
best to refer to the web page itself referenced at the bottom

Could you be a little more specific about what you see in
TeXmacs with the new version? Do you see the red --> prompt
from Axiom when you click Insert/Session/Axiom?

tmwin_axiom.zip is the first version of the new tm_axiom program
that I uploaded last week. There is a new flavour available this
week along with an updated Axiom binary included in the most recent
axiom-windows-0.1.2.exe install file.

However, I would have expected that old version to work since
the changes did not have anything to do with the basic function.

As a test (although this is not normally how you would use it)
could you try running tm_axiom from the cygwin command window?
It should start and wait for input. If you type something like

  1+1

followed by Enter, then you should see LaTeX output from Axiom.

If this doesn't happen there is a basic problem starting tm_axiom.

I have seen this happen so far only on one system (Windows 2000)
where I tried to install TeXmacs and Axiom. On that system AXIOMsys
runs ok from the command line, but if I type tm_axiom from the
command line, it starts and immediately exits with no message.
I am not sure what is causing this since exactly the same program
when copied to another system with Axiom runs fine.

On the test system where it fails, I do not have local admin rights
and the directory Program Files is protected from change. So I am
forced to installed Axiom and TeXmacs in a non-default location.
Still both Axiom and TeXmacs separately seem to run properly.

Since the only difference between that system where it fails
and other systems where it works is that fact that my access
privileges are considerably restricted where it fails, I suspect
that perhaps there is some missing operating system privilege
that is required by the new tm_axiom program because it uses
threaded execution? Windows XP has similar, and perhaps even
more elaborate access controls, to Windows 2000.

If possible, could you try re-installing the latest Windows
version from

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload

as the Administrator user of your XP system?

Then simply delete the tm_axiom.exe program from the cygwin
directory. Cygwin will then automatically find the new tm_axiom
from the Axiom directory which has been automatically added to
the path.

Let me know if this works. And if it does, do you have any
clue about what the specific operating system privilege might
be that makes this work when run as Administrator?

That is the behaviour of the old tm_axiom interface program
on both cygwin and Linux. It does not include any special LaTeX
line breaking code. Unfortunately TeXmacs is not able to do
line-breaking in most of the cases of LaTeX generated by Axiom
output. The newest version of tm_axiom that is included with
axiom-windows-0.1.2.exe does include the Axiom specific
line-breaking code (the save as originally written by Robert
Sutor and used in the production of the Axiom book). If you
can get that to work, then the output should look identical to
the book.

Thank you for trying this. If you can let me know the results
of what I suggested above, I would be very happy to try to
continue to assist you to get this working.

What is the 'xiom' script? I do not remember a script by this
name in the current version of axiom.

Normally the graphics cabable version of axiom is started
with the command

  sman

that provided socket communication services and starts a
special X-windows processes that does the graphics.

Hi,

 after hacking the xiom script, I got axiom up and running.

 From the book I tried the command

	  draw((x**2), x=0..10)

 and got a lot of "loading...." message, which ends up in:

    Loading /usr/axiom/mnt/linux/algebra/COORDSYS.o for package 
      CoordinateSystems 
   Graph data being transmitted to the viewport manager...

                                                 Type: TwoDimensionalViewport

 That's it...

 No plot, no result, no error....nothing else. 

 Any help is very appreciated.... ;)

 Thanky you very much in advance!

 PS: I tried complexer function directly copied from the book with the
 same result....

xiom is installed by axiom under /usr/bin/. after giving finally the
command

		make INSTALL=/usr/axiom COMMAND=/usr/bin/xiom install

as described in the README.

A command "sman" does not exist (neither in the executable path nor
under /usr/axiom/. and below.

What is going wrong here ?

Ah OK ! Sorry for that. But then I think that, in its present state (at le=

received it in my mailer) the message generated is largely incomprehensibl=

is no leading minus sign, only minus signs embedded in the middle of long =

Ah ? Well.. I had actually looked at it, and  I didn't even realize that t=
he message 
originated from this page :-(

If parts that are deleted from the web page are sent to the axiom-develope=
r list, I 
wonder if this is useful for others than the author of the previous versio=
n of the page? 
Maybe it would be better (if it is possible?) to send to the list only the=
 new parts, and 
send the complete message only to those who are directly involved in the w=
riting of the 
page, and have asked for the complete report on the wiki ? If it was possi=
ble, I think 
this would make the automatic notifications on axiom-developer less bulky =
and more 
comprehensible, and thus more useful ?

Ah OK, I will download it and try with this one. As it is rather large and=
 
wintm_axiom.exe is very small, could it be possible in the future to uploa=

or to send the new wintm_axiom.zip as attached file on the list or in priv=

When I type tmwin_axiom, nothing happens and I am sent back to cmd.exe pro=
mpt. 
When I type tm_axiom.exe (the cygwin one) I get the correct behaviour 
"latex:$\displaystyle 2 \leqno(1)$" etc.

Under XP, I have full admin rights, but I installed in non-default locatio=

Ahhh, I see. I have never done this before. I usually do the final
installation manually since that is how we used to have to do it.
This install thing was recently added. I have to admit that I also
have never read the README :) ...

Perhaps the make INSTALL is not copying the sman program.
Check in your original build location in the directory

  .../mnt/linux/bin

You should be able to run it from there and/or copy sman
to your install directory.

Jinzhong,

The reason your console output ended with a running Axiom command 
prompt is that the Axiom build runs tests. The test you were running
is called "wiggle" (src/input/wiggle.input.pamphlet). It attempts
to draw a graph on the screen. It appears that the graph process
never started (perhaps you don't have xhost permission to open a
window?) or that the graph process hung somewhere. Normally the
axiom build completes and returns to a top level shell prompt.

It appears that there may be a race condition for handling graphics.

As for the issue of )quit vs quit...
'quit' is a perfectly valid variable name as are most other
symbols so there has to be a syntax for "escaping" the commands.
axiom uses a leading paren for all commands.

In any case, you should now have a working axiom, right?

btw, please copy list as there are several
people on this list who either have answers or have similar problems.

Tim

============== attached email =========================================

It seems that someone has actually updated the version in the arch
server, so I updated my local copy without doing anything on the
Makefile.pamphlet. The problem seemed gone, but the compilation never
brought the prompt back. The following is the ending part of the
output of the compilation.

When I checked with 'ps', it seemed that 'mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys' has
been started, which I guess was axiom just built. Is this what I am
supposed to see? I don't think it a good idea to launch axiom right
away at the end of 'make'. Instead it may be more straightforward to
give a message telling how to launch axiom after the compilation
succeeds. In addition, I missed the ')' before 'quit' in my first try
after '(1) ->'. I guess that's the style you guys have been practicing
since 30 years ago with axiom. But from the viewpoint of user
friendliness, the symbols like ')' (leading a command) and '='
(leading a file name) had better been removed. What do you think?

I looked at the code of tmwin_axiom.c. I may be wrong, but it would seem t=
hat the 
variable AXIOM_exe is given the default value c:/Program

I think that can only mean that you did not build the graphics
capable version of Axiom, or possibly that your build did not
run all the way to completion.  The right version for graphics
should be available in the CVS repository for about the last
month, right Tim? I haven't done this for a while because I
have been building lately from the development arch repository
axiom--main--1 and axiom--windows--1.

As I recall the version of AXIOM make in CVS did not build sman
and other graphics programs until after it completed all of the
AXIOM algebra tests. If your system hangs during those tests,
then the graphics would not have been built. If you do have the
correct version from CVS it might be worthwhile repeating the

  make

step to see if it completes properly or if it is hung somewhere.

I did a

the only thing find finds was:

  ./src/include/sman.H1

so I think, there is more missing than a updated README... ;)

Yes you are right! I was in such a rush I did not even check
the obvious. Thank you very much.

I think that it should not specify a full path, only the
executable name. But I will have to check that that is
possible with that particular system call. If not, then
the path can be constructed from the AXIOM environment
variable.

I will make corrections and upload a new version later today.

Please have patience with us. This is open source development
and you are helping us a great deal by trying to follow our
sketchy and imprecise instructions. With your help and persistence
we will be able to make this easier for other people.

Of course if you have some specific changes to the documentation

to receive them. :)

Shouldn't it by

export AXIOM=/usr/axiom/mnt/linux

There should be no double slashes, but there should be some architecture

Please try the new version of tm_axiom that I have just now

This version includes corrections to read the AXIOM environment

Meino,

A minor point for clarification. As pointed out earlier, the `xiom'
script which was installed sets the environment variable AXIOM for
you, before launching the system proper. However, during a make, you
must set the AXIOM variable yourself as instructed by running
`configure' at the top of your source tree. 

I mention this because the AXIOM variable has appeared in two
different contexts throughout this discussion:

   1) During a make, the AXIOM variable is used to guide the build
      process. It points to the place where axiom is being built
      inside the source tree. Again, at this stage, the AXIOM
      variable should be set by hand as instructed by `configure'.

   2) When you type `make INSTALL=/usr/axiom COMMAND=/usr/bin/xiom
      install' the resulting `xiom' script will set the AXIOM variable
      appropriate for axioms new home.


I would like to second Bills comment and thank you for your patience
and help.

Jinzhong,

There is no need to try the build again. If it failed during testing
of the graphics it is likely the case that it built correctly.

The next step is to try to recover the zlc work from Xaiowei.
I might have a copy here. I'll look around.

The "diff-format" output could definitely be improved.  The place to do
this is in ZWiki itself, Diff.py: DiffSupport:textDiff.

Also the zwiki folder property (or per-page property) "mailout_policy"
can be set to either "comments" or "edits".  Right now it is set to
"edits" so is sending out these diffs.  I find them useless, and for
most cases "comments" is appropriate.  Note that when in "comments"
mode, emails will also be sent when new pages are created, but not when
pages are edited.

Is there some way we could have a hybrid?  e.g. when a page is edited we
send out the entire page with a comment at the top "this page was
edited".  If one wants to see line-by-line changes it can always be
retreived through the zwiki interface.

Axiom in TeXmacs for Windows users:

Now, assuming that the new tm_axiom file below does work for
you, with either please try the original Axiom test command
from the Axiom Book

  integrate (1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)

What you will find is that this very first example actually
fails :( to display properly in TeXmacs but very simple variants
such as

  integrate (1/(x**2 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)

actually do display properly. Almost everything else I try
also seems to work.

When I look at the document tree in TeXmacs - something that
only people with a little experience with TeXmacs should do -
as far as I can tell the coding for both of these cases is
correct.

So it seems that this is a bug in TeXmacs that we need to
discuss with the TeXmacs developers.

I have also included a revised axiom.ts style file in the
zip below that should replace the existing axiom.ts file
in both native and cygwin versions of TeXmacs. If there are
any TeXmacs style file wizards out there, I would like to
ask why this change seems to be necessary to properly format
Axiom output. In previous versions of TeXmacs this did not
seem to be necessary.

If you haven't already please download the newest version
of Axiom for Windows here

i was under the impression that you had packaged texmacs with axiom

methinks we could package the tm_axiom with axiom (src/texmacs?)
so it is available to those who want it.

also we should include the installer control file so we can change it.

Hmmm... what do you mean by a linux/texmacs binary? A binary
of what? There is a small interface program called tm_axiom.
Do you mean a binary version of that for linux?

There is already a tm_axiom interface that works with Linux
included with the linux version of TeXmacs itself. That version,
however does not include the Sutor line-break code. I did a
version of tm_axiom for linux last year that included the
line-break code but the TeXmacs developers chose not to include
it in their distribution. But I think it is still on Savannah
somewhere. I am planning to prepare an updated version of the
linux tm_axiom now that I know a little something about threads
(at least how they work under Windows :) I still have to learn
how it works under linux).

Do you think that we should distribute tm_axiom separately or
just include it with the linux builds of Axiom?

Yes, I agree. It is particular difficult to understand with long
text lines. The - marker looks ok if each line is short. A strike-out
kind of notation would be nice, but that seems hard to achieve in an
ascii only email. At the very least the long text lines could be
wrapped at some reasonable limit for ascii email and each folded
line prefixed with - or other character. How about

Deleted:
    Pre-context lines (2 or 3 lines)
  < deletions ...                     line folded at 72 chars
  < more deletions
    Post-context lines (2 or 3 lines)

Inserted:
    Pre-context lines (2 or 3 lines)
  > additions ...                     lines folded at 72 chars
  > more additions
    Post-context lines (2 or 3 lines)

would that be more readable?

Sending HTML email with pretty strike-outs etc (like on the
diffs page of the wiki itself) would be nice but it seems that
HTML is still poorly supported by a majority of email clients
in use by people who frequent the email lists. Allowing HTML
email as a user option might be a good idea.

I had a lot of second thoughts about enabling the "edits" mode
especially before there was the preview option since then there
were a lot of unnecessarily detailed diffs being generated as
one got a page to look the way one wanted. The preview function
relieves a lot of that.

But I worry about missing important changes to a page since a lot
of times the main reason for subscribing is to track such changes.

I am tempted to say that all that is necessary is to send a
notice containing a url link to the diffs of a page if there
is some change on that page. That way the user could see the
diffs displayed in nicely formated HTML and easily navigate
to the page if they want to read the whole thing. But perhaps
we do want to include something more useful in the email
notice itself. However I think the whole page for each small
change might be a bit too much.

Great ! The new tm_axiom works perfectly, now. However, the Jenks
integration example does not appear correctly : the big left
parenthesis is not a \left( but an ordinary (, the same for the right
parenthesis. Moreover, the third line disappears. I have pasted the
input in tm-axiom.exe in a cmd.exe command window, and then the \left(
and \right) appear correctly, and the whole LaTeX formula is correct
(in particular the third line is also present). So it seems to be a
bug in the LaTeX import module of TeXmacs, as you already pointed a
few days ago to Andrey Grozin.

I tried also with the same input but with power -1/3 instead of 1/3,
and the result appears to have big left and right parentheses, but the
first two lines are incorrect. So the error seems not to be localized
to the treatment of \left( and \right).

On the other hand, the output of the cygwin tm_axiom is correct,
although on a single line. So I think that the only solution for
users, for the Windows version of Axiom, would be to include the
cygwin tm_axiom, until Andrey or Joris provide a corrected import
module of LaTeX arrays in TeXmacs ?

And congratulations for the great work !

Or is it too early?? (I guess we are all the same ... :)

When I display these formula on my system - both native
Windows and cygwin versions display the Axiom

                                  Type: Expression Integer

output immediately after the equation number, on the same
line, often wrapping to the start of the next line. Something
like this:

                     x+y+z            (2)Type: Expression
Integer

Normally it is formatted on the next full line below with
right hand justification. The change to the stylesheet
is to add an explicit new-line formatting command for
\axiomtype{...} to force it to a new line. In previous
versions of TeXmacs, this was not necessary since it was
automatically treated like a new paragraph.

Have a good night.

Yes, I agree completely, it seems it is not a bug in Sutor's break algorit=

TeXmacs module that imports LaTeX arrays.

Actually if you look closely, it is correct but just formatted
in a rather unexpected style. To see this try

  numer(I1)

You will notice that in the full expression, the first term of
the numerator has been folded locally at the \cdot into two lines
with a leading minus sign vertically centered on the right like
this

   b^2x^2\sqrt{3} \cdot
-                               + 2b^2x^2\sqrt{3}log(sqrt[3]{-a^2} ...
   \log(sqrt[3]{-a^2}^2 ...

This type of "nested folding" is actually built in to Robert
Sutor's algorithm. There may be an option that I am not explicitly
setting which controls this type of behaviour.

See also the web page at

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/VeryLongLaTeX

I am glad to see that all of these examples work on MathAction
since MathAction is actually using LaTeX internally to do the
formatting. So this represents a reasonable "benchmark" against
which to compare the TeXmacs output.

> So the error seems not to be localized to the treatment of

Yes, I agree. This is true in at least the current version of
TeXmacs. I seem to recall somewhat different behaviour in the
versions of TeXmacs that were current at this time last year.
The current problems might have something to do with how TeXmacs
converts \begin{array} structures into tables and an interaction
of the table entries (where each table entry is a folded line)
with complex math formatting.

So far I only know one example that fails to display properly.
Unfortunately it is the very first example in the book! Arghh.
One example of an apparently wrong result that is not easily
distinguished as a typesetting problem is enough to "stop the
show", of course. However I am optimistic that this can be
corrected quite easily since other apparently equally complex
examples actually do work.

I think that the more we (Axiom developers) depend on TeXmacs,
the more we must be prepared to try to help maintain TeXmacs -
just as we already have a great (sometimes two-way) relationship
with the GCL developers, on which the current version of Axiom
strongly depends ... :) That is just the nature of complex open
source development projects, I guess. So, as time permits, I hope
to be able to begin to work directly with the TeXmacs source code.
But so far it looks as foreign to me as Axiom's "bootsys" level
did to be two years ago ... <sigh>.

-Reported by Andrey G. Grozin:
Experiment 0

  The first example below was reported by Andrey G. Grozin as failing
when displayed in TeXmacs when using the Sutor line-break algorithm.
But typeset and folded correctly by TeXmacs without the line-break
algorithm. However it does appear correctly below and it is also
correct in the most recent versions of TeXmacs (1.0.4.5 on cygwin
and 1.0.4.4 on native windows) when using the newest version of
"tm_axiom":http://page.axiom-developer.org/tm_axiom.zip and
the version of Axiom at AxiomDownload.

++added:

  This expression is not folded at all by the current version of
TeXmacs but it displayed correctly both here and in TeXmacs when
using the line-break algorithm.

++added:
Experiment 2

  This is the first example in the Jenks and Sutor AXIOM book.
It is formatted properly below but in TeXmacs the output is
wrong - small instead of large brackets and one of the terms
of the numerator not display at all. Without the line-break
algorithm TeXmacs displays it correctly but as one long non-
folded line.

\begin{axiom}
integrate (1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(1/3)),x)
\end{axiom}

Experiment 3

  This simple variant of the above expression, (-1/3) instead
of (1/3), is formatted properly both here and in TeXmacs

\begin{axiom}
integrate (1/(x**3 * (a+b*x)**(-1/3)),x)
\end{axiom}

Notice that the first term in the paranthesis appears a little
odd at first site because the first term itself is "locally
folded" at the ${\mathbf \cdot}$ with a vertically centered leading minus sign.

Subject: Axiom I/O/conversion questions

Hello,

1) How can the user use the batch mode?

   (Say, to have a bat like  AXIOMsys < in.input > in.output
   where in in.input one can put some AXIOM inputs)

2) How the user can convert an Axiom output to a string?
                    x
   Say, instead of  -  it would be great to see x/2
                    2

3) How can the user (in a simple way, without much writing)
   enter a protocol mode (automated registering of the
   inputs AND outputs)?

   Things like )spool test.txt sends to a file only the output...

Much thanks in advance.

Subject: Nightly build

Hi,

 this night I did a complete fresh rebuild of axiom-2004-11-15.
 Nothing was patched or hacked beside of the options

		   --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd

 in lsp/Makefile.pamphlet.

 The compressed logfile of this build is ~ 758738 bytes long
 (bzip2-compressed). If one wants it, I will mail it.

 The logfile shows no Error-lines. I did a 

	 grep '\*\*\*' MAKELOG | grep -i error

 to find them. Nor did make stop on an error.

 Nonetheless, a second

	 make 

 afterwards shows that the build was not successful:

That your SYS variable is not set implies that the AXIOM variable is
not set (SYS is derived from AIXOM in the makefile). Perhaps on the
second invocation of make you were using a new shell? 


Tim: Perhaps we should add a basic sanity check to the

checkenvironment:
	-@ if [ "x$(AXIOM)" = "x" ] ; then echo "** no AXIOM variable **"

Is there a plan in place for geting the configure script to
automaticly set the AXIOM variable? A minimal goal might be to have
configure generate a Makefile.include and `include' this everywhere.

First, I do not understand your reason for doing a second make
if the log of the first one is very long and apparently completed
without any error message. Why did you not just run AXIOMsys to
see if it worked? You can do this without first doing a
make install. You can run Axiom from where it was built in
the

  .../mnt/linux/bin

directory. You could also try sman etc.

Perhaps you could send just the first 10 lines of your log file?

The second time you ran make, the AXIOM variable seems to have
been again set incorrectly. The reason I say this is that the first
line of the make output below shows SYS= which means that this
variable is empty. It should be 'linux'. Please compare that to
the first line of you log file.

If you look at the commands in Makefile you will see that it
contains

  SYS=$(notdir $AXIOM)

This command gets the last part of the path after the last /
contained the AXIOM variable. As the ./configure says

    You must set your AXIOM and PATH variables. Type:

    export AXIOM=/tmp/axiom/mnt/linux
    export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

This means that YOU must do this. You must type these commands
exactly as you see them before running make. The first line
MUST NOT end in /. If it does, then SYS will be empty and make
will fail.

What I prefer to do is to use cut-and-paste so that I do not
make a mistake.

Third, I think that it is not a good idea to use the /tmp
directory in this way. Linux can freely delete files from
/tmp that it thinks are no longer needed. It is better
to put the axiom source in a sub-directory in your home
directory.

You can see that SPAD SYS are not correct in the first
line of the log output above.

I think that you intend to compile the AXIOM system from
the source files. No?

Subject: Re: Nightly build

Meino,

The problem is your AXIOM variable again. 
Perhaps I should explain it in more detail.

The AXIOM variable is used at 2 different times, during make and
during execution.

===================================================================

First, lets look at the make case:

The build process needs to know 2 things. It needs to know where
the axiom sources are. It needs to know what kind of system to build.
Both of these pieces of information are in the AXIOM shell variable.

Suppose you download axiom into /tmp/axiom and 
you want to build a linux system. 
The AXIOM shell variable would be set to:

export AXIOM=/tmp/axiom/mnt/linux
             ^^^^^^^^^^
             where          ^^^^^
                            what

when the make starts it looks for where it will find the sources and
gets /tmp/axiom. It next looks for what kind of system to build and
gets linux.

Now if we look at the environment variables from your build we see:
SPAD=/tmp/axiom/mnt/ 
SYS= 
SPD=/tmp/axiom 
LSP=/tmp/axiom/lsp 
GCLDIR=/tmp/axiom/lsp/gcl-2.6.5 SRC=/tmp/axiom/src 
INT=/tmp/axiom/int 
OBJ=/tmp/axiom/obj 
MNT=/tmp/axiom/mnt 
ZIPS=/tmp/axiom/zips 
TMP=/tmp/axiom/obj/tmp 
SPADBIN=/tmp/axiom/mnt//bin 
INC=/tmp/axiom/src/include 
CCLBASE=/tmp/axiom/obj//ccl/ccllisp 
PART=cprogs 
SUBPART=everything 
NOISE=-o /tmp/axiom/obj/tmp/trace 
GCLVERSION=gcl-2.6.5 
TANGLE=/tmp/axiom/mnt//bin/lib/notangle

and, ignoring the irrelevant ones:

In the top level makefile we see:

SPD=$(shell pwd)

which means that SPD will be the current working directory. 
It got set to:

SPD=/tmp/axiom

which is correct.

Next in the Makefile we see:

SYS=$(notdir $(AXIOM))

which got set to:

SYS= 

which is NOT correct. It should have been 

SYS=linux

so from this information we can figure out that your AXIOM variable
was set to:

AXIOM=/tmp/axiom

which is wrong. It should have been:

AXIOM=/tmp/axiom/mnt/linux

===================================================================



Second, the AXIOM variable is used at runtime to tell axiom where
it lives. When you build an axiom system everything that is important
and worth keeping lives under the mnt subdirectory. So to "install"
an Axiom system into /usr/local/axiom, for example, you need only
copy the mnt subdirectory thus:

mkdir /usr/local/axiom
cd /tmp/axiom
cp -pr mnt /usr/local/axiom

Now that we've done that we can remove the whole axiom directory
from /tmp because it is no longer needed. 

However, in order to run Axiom we need 2 pieces of information.
First, we have to tell Axiom where it now lives and second, we
have to put the commands on our path so they can be found. So,
since we installed axiom into /usr/local/axiom we need:

export AXIOM=/usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

The AXIOM shell variable tells axiom where to find itself.
The PATH shell variable tells linux where to find executables.

Hope this helps.

Meino,

If you got your sources from savannah via CVS then those sources
will not properly build sman. The problem is the line in the
src/Makefile.pamphlet file. In your version it reads:

DIRS=bootdir interpdir sharedir algebradir inputdir etcdir clefdir docdir \
     graphdir smandir

It should read:

DIRS=bootdir interpdir sharedir algebradir etcdir clefdir docdir \
     graphdir smandir inputdir 

This will be fixed in the next savannah release which is scheduled 
for the first of January.

If you want you can correct this line and try rebuilding the system.

Hi Bill, Hi List ;)

 yes, while fireing up the second make AXIOM was not set....my fault,
 sorry... my head got confused a little while all this compiling.

 Normally I do not "make" a second time, but before searching through 
 a 15763936 bytes long MAKELOG for the reason why sman do not build
 (and possibly not finding it...) I restart make and (normally) it
 will fail exactly at that point.

 After setting AXIOM again, the second make runs "successfully" ( ==
 without complaining) but sman still is not built.

 I can start AXIOMsys. A "draw" command put nothing else than a lot of
 text on the terminal (sman is missing).

 Yes I downloaded axio.20041115.tgz (source) from savannah to build
 Axiom.

 I had setup my own Linux (no distribution used, Linux was build from
 source by hand from ground up). At least for my system I can say,
 that there is no cron job or anything else except myself, who
 deletetes anything from /tmp.

 Meino

where the dir name and file name are any legal name for the OS, then the f=

Introduce in Bill's tm_axiom.c the possibility to select the correct ini f=

Subject: RE: Minor bugs

Tim,

I have been plugging away trying to apply some of the
outstanding patches recorded on Savannah to my local
copy of axiom--main--1. After a few miss-steps I think
I now almost understand the procedure that you sketched
below. But I am still confused about how to do the
regression testing part. Is this described somewhere?

As I understand it the idea is to maintain a set of hand
verified result files (*.output) and to compare the output
of selected (*.input) files to their corresponding (*.output)
file. If the comparison fails then a error is raised. (How?
Where?) How does this relate to the "Daly bug" hack that
you have also described.

Anyway, I am looking for a quick recipe and an example.

So far this what I have done is:

1) Applied the negative float rounding/truncation patch from
Savannah to the floats.spad.pamphlet file.

2) Created a simple input file called
     negfloats.input.pamphlet
   in the src/input directory that executes some Axiom
   commands illustrating the bugs

3) Modified the file src/input/Makefile.pamphlet to
   include the following new subsection and stanzas

\subsection{negfloats}
<<negfloats>>=
${OUT}/negfloats.input: ${MID}/negfloats.input
        @ echo 426 making ${OUT}/negfloats.input from =
${MID}/negfloats.input
        @ cp ${MID}/negfloats.input ${OUT}/ngefloats.input

${MID}/negfloats.input: ${IN}/negfloats.input.pamphlet
        @ echo 427 making ${MID}/negfloats.input from
${IN}/negfloats.input.pamphlet
        @(cd ${MID} ; \
          ${TANGLE} ${IN}/negfloats.input.pamphlet >negfloats.input )

4) Made a new entry for negfloats in

FILES= ${OUT}/algaggr.input  ${OUT}/algbrbf.input    =
${OUT}/algfacob.input \
       ...
       ${OUT}/ndftip.input   ${OUT}/newlodo.input \
       ${OUT}/negfloats.input \
       ...

5) Added a reference to <<negfloats>> in <<*>>=

<<*>>=
...
<<NDFtip>>
<<negfloats>>
...

6) Did axiom 'make' to compile the revised floats domain and
   (hopefully) run the negfloats.input test file.

   ./configure
   (set AXIOM and PATH manually ... yuck :)
   make

-------

Now what about checking the results of negfloats.input?
Where do I look? Provided I like the output, how do I make
it part of the regression suite? How can I easily tell if the
new .input file "passes"?

If you could spend a bit of time completing and correcting this
recipe for me, I will put it on a web page somewhere for easy
reference.

<soapbox>
BTW, all of this stuff seems so excrutiatingly low-level to
me and SO EASY to break one way or another

 <b>like most of the Axiom build process --  !!</b>

<sigh />

I am becoming used to the idea of automated tools that make
this "messing around with picky details" less unnecessary.
Documentation is of course is still important but when it is
at such a low level and burdened with many details, just the
"on ramp" to the learning curve becomes very high even if the
process itself is quite simple.

I find I spend an enormous amount of time just correctly
stupid simple silly mistakes like the use of a space some
place in a Makefile rather than a tab. Using "stupid tools"
always makes me feel stupid...

Since a lot of the "pickiness" is just in the use of the
noweb/pamphlet low-level literature programming stuff, we
could for example (if we had infinite time and resources :),
invest in a more high-level literate programming tool such
as Leo.

  http://leo.sourceforge.net/
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/leo/
  http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html
  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=408847

  The highlights of Leo 4.2: 
  - @thin trees make Leo much more friendly to cvs. 
  - Leo's data structures have been reorganized to make outline
    operations significantly faster. All old scripts still work. 
  - @test and @script nodes convert scripts to unit tests
    automatically. You can convert scripts to unit tests in
    seconds! 
  - A faster and more robust spell checker plugin. (requires
    Python 2.3) 
  - Leo is now much more friendly to using spaces instead of
    tabs. 
  - The Execute Script command reports erroneous lines more
    clearly. 
  - Leo draws large outlines more quickly using less memory. 
  - Dozens of other improvements. 

Leo provides some very nice project outlining tools including
folding etc., that can considerably reduce the apparent
complexity. And it serves (more or less) like an integrated
development environment for literate programming.

At the very least I think we need to spend more time
structuring the whole build process in a simpler way (i.e.
make more use of the advanced features of gnu make). I think
the whole thing from start to finish could be MUCH simpler
and the Makefiles much smaller. But then, what we have now
works (at least for those who designed it ... :) so of course
the incentive is not so great to change it. Still it seems
to me to be a significant barrier to greater participation
by other developers.

The regression test process has not yet been recovered.
I'll document it when I do recover it. Like everything
else it "should" be working now but it all takes time.
You've followed the pattern so your input file will be
picked up in the regression process when it works.

The regression testing is done by hand for the moment.

Yes, but trivial to fix because it's just a missing character or two.
The reliability of a process is a ratio of the mean-time-to-failure
and the mean-time-to-repair. The build process is easily broken but
trivial to fix, thus higly reliable. Note that I've included explicit
debugging information (those pesky unique echo line numbers) so the
location of a mistake is painfully obvious and so is the fix.

If you have to work "thru a tool" and there is a bug in the tool you
can spend hours (a) deciding it's a tool bug and (b) fixing the tool.
Just look at the struggles of line-breaking and texmacs.

Axiom is a finely tuned, high performance, very large machine.
I'm working to include every bit of knowledge about the build
process into the makefiles so (a) it works, (b) it's automated
and (c) it's documented.

The makefiles are not hard as evidenced by the fact that i gave you 
NO instructions on how to make the changes and you did everything
correctly. The makefiles are tedious, I'll give you that.

I downloaded and used Leo when I started this process but
Leo does not really understand the pamphlet structure and
Leo isn't emacs. Editors are like wives; you only get one,
you learn its quirks, you learn to love its features and
flaws, it is very costly to switch, your new editor 
hates it when you use expressions from the previous editor,
and you can get in deep trouble asking the new editor to
do what the old editor used to do. I'm married to emacs.

Leo was not effective for me. If you can use it without
breaking the pamphlet structure it should be transparent
to everyone else.

In the fullness of time I'm hoping that your mathaction
site (and the doyen local version of it) understands the
pamphlet file structure and we can use it directly to 
maintain the sources.

Ummm, your definition of 'simpler' is different from mine.
Using "advanced" features in gmake is NOT making it 'simpler'.
Up until the introduction of $(shell..) the makefiles were
"vanilla" and did not depend on any version of make. The
size of the makefile is not a measure of complexity as you'll
discover that there is a simple, repetitive pattern used in every
makefile.

My other open source project (magnus) used a makefile scheme
that used every feature of gnu-make. In fact, it used the gcc
compiler with the -MM switch to automatically generate the
stanzas and dynamically load and evaluate the make dependencies.
It was 'simple' in some sense but it took several days to decode
how it worked because everything about the makefile was dynamic.
unless you understood the gcc -MM switch, dynamic stanza loading,
filename completion rules, and were a gnu-make wizard it was 
unreadable and unmaintainable. 

My makefiles are 'dumb' by design. Keep it dirt simple.  For every
file there is a stanza.  The makefile structure follows the directory
structure.  You don't even need to guess which makefile to modify as
the makefile is always in the current directory.

Each directory has a makefile which has 2 responsibilities:
(a) 'make' all subdirectories and (b) build its piece of
the final build. it's a tree rooted at the top level.

And within each makefile there is a stanza for each final file in the
build that gets made. No implicit rules are used.  Every stanza is
uniquely tagged by number and a comment of intention.  The makefiles
follow the "pull" model. that is,

  final file in mnt   DEPENDS-ON file in obj    (the sys dep files)

  file in obj         DEPENDS-ON file in int    (the sys indep files)

  file in int         DEPENDS-ON pamphlet file in src

  doc file in mnt/doc DEPENDS-ON pamphlet file in src

I've previously explained the reasoning behind the src/int/obj/mnt
structure. make (and gmake and configure) are based on the C 
programmers world-view. They are not really capable of cleanly
handling cross-directory dependencies although they can be
coerced into it. 

In the fullness of time I'd like the whole system to be in
common lisp. At that point i believe we should rewrite the
build machinery so it uses 'asdf' or 'mk:defsystem' which
follow the lisp worldview.

For me, mean-time-to-repair is VERY HIGH. It takes the system
on which I am running these builds about 1 hour to get around
to pointing out to me that I used a space instead of a comma.
I have repeated this process (as time permitted) about 10
times over the last two days, each time repairing just one
little thing that I had not idea I had broken.

After 2+ years of doing this stuff with Axiom I STRONGLY
disagree.

Yes, useful if it even gets to that stage.

Leo has a better approach than "pamphlets".

That is a bad state to be in. As far as I am concerned
editors are "a dime a dozen" I probably use half a dozen
different editors all in the same day. I am more particular
about my relations with other people, however ... :)

No, the pamphlet structure is too particular to Axiom.
But it is possible to do the same thing with Leo, only
better.

Perhaps, I like the idea of a collaboration project
environment mediated by something like MathAction, but
I think that is quite a long way off. In the mean time
Leo has a lot of useful features that one can get just
by downloading it to your desktop.

For the most part the "advanced" features of gmake are
quite trivial to learn - no more difficult than programming
in lisp. And if by learning one or two things it is possible
to reduce 3000 lines of makefile stanzas to just three lines
that it seems to me that the gain is enormous. Yes it takes
be a little longer to understand exactly what those 3 lines
are doing, but when I do it is equivalent to having read
and understood 3000 lines of other approach.

A simple repetitive pattern is a sure sign that you
are coding at too low a level.

I would VERY MUCH prefer that this approach be used with
AXIOM. Compared to the time it might take to become a "wizard"
working repeatedly with the low-level "keep it simple" approach
eats up far more of my time.

Really I can only say that this just looks like a big mess

Yes, we do certainly have different "world views"!!

Tim, please excuse the tone of this reply. I know that
it sounds rather adversarial. But keep in mind that I am
writing this while waiting for the 11th repeat of make
to come back and tell me I left out one more comma or

No problem. I understand the frustrations of making Axiom.
Remember, Axiom used to take 3 weeks to build so life is now sweet.
You DO printout, desk-check, and hand-execute your changes
before you run it, right? (and where is your flowchart?)

Actually, that's only the input to the regression mechanism
which is yet to be recovered.

Clearly this is a question of taste. It appears that you view
'make' as a programming language and I view 'make' as a list
of commands. I fear the "slippery slope" of using gmake features.

It's been my experience that any project that starts down that
path eventually heads toward ever-more-clever makefiles. Witness
the patch that we do to GCL. Neither you nor I know what the
sed script does that mangles lists of filenames. Programmers
simply cannot resist features.

Makefiles that use "advanced features" (like if blocks, gcl -MM,
includes, sed-built file lists, dynamic stanza loading, etc) quickly
change 'make' into yet-another-programming-language.

I can read (and program) complex makefiles. I just don't want to write
a program in a language consisting mostly of line-noise. The
rule-based programming feature of make (a DEPENDS-ON b) is useful for
minimizing work redone but the rest of the features are truly bad
language design. This might as well be APL code.

I find these examples (taken from real makefiles at random) hard to read:

Makefiles, for me, are just a record of the correct sequence of
lists of commands needed to build a system. Isn't this simple?

I agree that implicit stanzas shorten the makefiles and would reduce
the clutter and size of the makefile. Provided the implicit stanza
was generic enough to work in both make and gmake it might be ok.
They "break" two design points: stanza-per-file and unique echo numbering.
However, I'm more willing now to reconsider implicit stanzas if only
to concede to a meet-in-the-middle compromise.

Tim,

Shortly after my last message I did (finally) manage to
get a clean build. But I can't help but feel like there
must still be some "loose wires" in the
src/input/Makefile.pamphlet because I kept having to
repair things that I never changed. For example make
suddenly started complaining about a file named
XPOLY.output (no rule for target), it occurs in the list
named OUTS but sure enough I can't find any stanza and I
certainly didn't add anything with that name. There are
other stanzas for xpoly.input etc., but nothing with
uppercase names. I just commented it out and the build
worked. Weird.

Actually, I started programming in 1970 so I do have
some grey hair and a few stories to tell myself. The
trouble is, machines are enormously faster - that's
nice, but people are just as slow as ever.

No, I do not think 'make' is either of these. When used
properly a Makefile is just an abstract specification of
the dependency relationships between objects mapped to
associated concrete actions that implement those dependencies.
There should be no procedural programming in a make file at
all. The goal of 'make' is to allow the programmer to work
at a higher level of abstraction, knowing that for each
change to the objects she makes, 'make' will convert her
specification into a minimum set of actions to take on all
the related objects that are necessary in order to satisfy
the dependencies.

Actually this very likely has a nice tidy formal description
as an adjoint functor on some category or other, I am sure.
But that is another story.

This has nothing to do with 'make' as such. But yes, on first
examination I do find the GCL makefiles largely unintelligible.
Certainly in part this is because of the use of "clever hacks"
such as the one you mention. But in most cases I think you
will probably discover that such obscure coding is forced
on the programmer by a number of other circumstances some
of which are beyond their direct control. Usually this has
a lot to do with the lack of standards. I think this problem
is gradually, with the rise of the Internet and open source
development we are at last we are learning to appreciate the
value of standards.

Again, when used properly these things should be just short-
cuts for specifying a large number of complex dependencies
in a simple manner. Often this takes for form of a kind of
"2nd order" program whose output is the specification of some
dependencies. I agree that sometimes the methods for specifying
these dependencies that is chosen by the designer of a makefile
can be as obscure and poorly documented as any other programming
language.

I agree with you (except for the slur against APL :). But I
think that it is possible to write efficient makefiles, i.e.
short and relatively simple, makefiles without such "line noise".
Such obscure notation for make specifications is usually just
expedient, poorly thought out design that turns to stone when
it cannot be maintained. It is possible to write obscure
programs in almost any language. And unix shell script is
one of the easiest in which to do this.

This one appears complex precisely because of the shell script.
This is not make's fault, it is the fault of the programmer
who choose to use these commands. But this is actually
not so hard to understand if you understand the unix tools
and filters that are being used.

I think most of your other examples are similar

No. If that is all that make was, then why not simply write
out that sequence of commands and stop messing around with
dependencies.

Implicit stanzas are another way of providing a large number
of specifications in an economical manner but they can only
be used to specify very simple relationships. Still, I agree
that a few carefully chosen implicit stanzas would go a
long way to reducing the sheer bulk of the current Axiom
makefiles.

Yes, I like meet-in-the-middle compromises. Isn't that
one way to help make a marriage last a little longer. :)

Bill,

If you say ')set message test on' then every failure will generate
the message "Daly bug". The simple hack is to grep the .output files
and find these messages.

Some input files have examples in them that are intended to fail.
These intentional failures are wrapped in order to turn off the
"Daly bug" message when the failure occurs. 

This provides a way to distinguish the failure cases.

Ah OK ! you are right, everything is there, although the formula is nonsense when read 
normally. So, on this example, it is Sutor's algorithm that is broken, and TeXmacs 
renders Sutor's output correctly, except that it imports incorrectly the "l" parameter of 
arrays into a "c" parameter.

In Sutor's output, the three lines you mention are constructed as an array embedded in 
the main array, and it seems there is an end of line \\ which is inserted incorrectly 
inside this embedded array, while it ought to be after the \end{array}. Otherwise, there 
ought to be a \left( just before the embedded array, and a \right) after its end, for the 
LaTeX output to be correct mathematically ; and this is apparently not what was 
intended, as these are absent, and as the rest of formula is on the right instead of 
being below.

Well, I don't really agree on this point ? For me, the last formula on

While Axiom depends on gcl, it does not depend on TeXmacs. I think we
ought to privilege rigor, not ease of use. For education or training
with Axiom, TeXmacs is very nice. But for research, in my opinion, the
default editor for Axiom ought to be Emacs, not TeXmacs. Some
adaptation to Axiom of imaxima.el, by Jesper Harder, would be vey
nice, as it relies on TeX itself, and the new version of Emacs allows
to include images, on Linux and Windows. So, beautiful output and
rigor can coexist.

Well, in my case there could be, but unless someone other than me

Subject: Re: GCL results on Solaris

Greetings!  And thanks for your feedback!

The problem appears to be, from the make log you sent, that the local
bfd library is not being built at all.  Either this, or it has been
built in a previous run and not cleaned before this one.  The latter
is actually the more probable, as configure did setup the BUILD_BFD
make direction correctly.  What you should see immediately after
configure ends and make begins is:

add-defs1 386-linux
using 386-linux.defs
cd binutils/bfd && make
make[1]: Entering directory `/fix/t1/camm/debian/gcl/gcl-2.6.5/binutils/bfd'

So lets assume you already have the h/bfd.h and binuntils/bfd/libbfd.a
(et.al.).

Even if you don't have boolean defined in your gcc (quite doubtful),
you should get it in h/bfd.h generated by the local bfd build:

#if defined (__GNUG__) && (__GNUC__ > 2 || (__GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 6))
#define TRUE_FALSE_ALREADY_DEFINED
#else
#if defined (__bool_true_false_are_defined)
/* We have <stdbool.h>.  */
#define TRUE_FALSE_ALREADY_DEFINED
#endif
#endif
#ifdef MPW
/* Pre-emptive strike - get the file with the enum.  */
#include <Types.h>
#define TRUE_FALSE_ALREADY_DEFINED
#endif /* MPW */
#ifndef TRUE_FALSE_ALREADY_DEFINED
typedef enum bfd_boolean {false, true} boolean;
#define BFD_TRUE_FALSE
#else
/* Use enum names that will appear nowhere else.  */
typedef enum bfd_boolean {bfd_fffalse, bfd_tttrue} boolean;
#endif

Once you have this file, you might try the simple test program:

#include "h/bfd.h"
int main() {
boolean x;
return 0;
}

If this compiles, then we're left with the following -- I notice
you've placed /opt/csw/include in the -I flags as opposed to the
C_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable.  The latter is more flexible, and
also differs from what you've done insofar as your method preempts the
standard -I gcc command line flags (-I../h -I../gcl-tk) as well as the
system include path.  If you have a bfd.h in /opt/csw/include, it will
preempt h/bfd.h, and may lead to this problem, but will certainly lead
to other problems later if not.  bfd.h and libbfd.a/libiberty.a must
be synchronous.

So my first suggestion is to make sure the gcl directory is cleaned to
start (make clean in this directory), remove the -I/opt.... flag, do
'export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/csw/include' (or setenv C_INCLUDE_PATH
/opt... if using csh) as well as the analogous settings for
LIBRARY_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and possibly PATH as posted previously,
retry, and send me the results again exactly as you did so helpfully
this time.  

Please feel free to write back if any of this needs clarification --
I'm writing rather quickly.  Also, will be leaving town for about 1
week on Tue. evening.

Take care,

Savannah wouldn't care as it's actually hosted on a machine I pay for,

Likely, however, is that the users will download both because they

Yes, I agree with you, this would be interesting, but IMHO, probably
better to wait until the tm_axiom problem be solved
satisfactorily. Otherwise, downloading a large file, running it and
finding it does not work with the very first example of the Axiom book
might provide a disastrous feeling.

I like the idea of the axiom.ini file. I think as someone
else mentioned earlier, this might be a good way to get
around some of the awkwardness of the setting of the
AXIOM environment variable.

BTW, have you confirmed that it is possible to execute these
programs directly from CD? What about setting the AXIOM
environment variable and the PATH which is done now during
installation? I think TeXmacs might require a place to write
temporary files. I don't think Axiom requires this.

Specifying an alternate axiom.ini file on the command line
as you suggest above would require some serious surgery to
the way Axiom starts up. Axiom already has the ability to
read a file containing Axiom commands on startup called

  axiom.input

I know this works under Linux when the file is placed in
the user's home directory. Under Windows exactly where to
put this file is not too clear. I just tried with a file
of this name in the current directory when starting AXIOMsys
from the command line, but the commands in axiom.input
where not read by AXIOMsys :( So this needs more testing.

Typically this file contains commands like

  )set message autoload off

etc. But perhaps this could be extended to include user
interface options without disturbing Axiom itself. E.g.

  --Option: TeXmacs line-break off

would be treated as a comment by Axiom but could be
read and interpreted by the tm_axiom program on startup.

Yes, this would be quite easy. But since tm_axiom is a separate
program form AXIOMsys and in fact is invoked by TeXmacs, not
by Axiom, the Axiom command line option would not be of much
use here. Perhaps there a similar option already available in
TeXmacs? In that case some change would have to be made to
the scheme coding that actually starts tm_axiom in order to
pass the file name and/or options to tm_axiom. I suppose this
would not be hard for someone who knows scheme and also
something about TeXmacs internals. Is anyone willing to help
me to implement this?

Yes, either alternative would be easy to implement in tm_axiom.
Would you consider manually setting or changing an environment
variable "too difficult" for the average Windows user? If not
then I think that is the best way to go. I can arrange to set
this variable to some default during installation on Windows.
How would you control this when running Axiom directly from
CD?

I agree that it is undesirable to put all of Axiom in a
sub-directory of the TeXmacs tree.

If the new tm_axiom consults the TM_AXIOM environment variable
and finds

  TM_AXIOM=texbreaker:n

then it can be made to behave exactly the way the cygwin
tm_axiom does now.

I think Sutor's logic for splitting long products is slightly
different than for splitting sums and that might explain some
of the difference (e.g. absence of parenthesis). Would you be
willing to send me some hand modified LaTeX coding for this
example so that we are both completely clear on what you are
proposing. In that case I will attempt to analyze the
linebreak program and make the necessary changes.

Actually in principle Axiom has been built with many different
lisp environments in the past and Tim has plans to support
several of these again, so technically Axiom does not depend
on gcl either. My point was only that open source development
presumes an active co-operative relationship between related
projects.

What do you find more attractive about Emacs for research?

I am not familiar with running Axiom in Emacs but I would
like to learn and also to document it for other users.
I have set up a new [User Interface] page on MathAction
where I hope to describe the different user interface options
available for Axiom. Would you be willing to take a look at

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/UserInterface

and perhaps edit it to include some basic instructions for
Emacs users?

Can you tell me or point me to instructions on how to
install and set up Emacs on windows to access Maxima and
use imaxima.el? I experimented with this about 6 months
ago but I did not get very far. As I recall I had some
difficulty especially installing the imaxima component.
But I would like to try again. I am hoping also to learn
enough about the interface to Maxima in order to also
provide a Maxima interface on MathAction.

Since ZWiki appears to generate the email directly from the
original source format, on the last edits to the website that
I did, I deliberately keep the editing line length of the
text contents short, anticipating how these edits would look
when sent out as email. I think the fact that you found the
result more readable confirms my proposal that ZWiki should
do such line folding automatically during the preparation
of the email.

I can make this change on the MathAction site and then
propose a patch to the ZWiki developers.

We will try to find a solution to that problem as soon as

Yes, absolutely. What we have now is only a very preliminary
version of Axiom on Windows and Tim Daly has only just recently
got the graphics working on Linux. In principle porting the
graphics to Windows should not be too difficult however we
have two problems:

  1) the socket communication protocol with GCL (the lisp
     system on which Axiom depends) on Windows has not yet
     been fully tested. sockets are needed for Axiom graphics.

  2) right now Axiom graphics also requires the X-windows
     environment. X windows in not available under native
     Windows so either we have to port the graphics code to
     another windowing library that is available under native
     Windows or we might be forced (for the first release of
     graphics at least) to resort to the cygwin environment
     under windows for the graphics.

I think we can probably achieve Axiom graphics functionality
under cygwin quit easily (say within 1 or 2 months) but for
users who do not already have cygwin installed, setting up
the X-windows environment can be a little complex. On the
other hand, the cygwin version of TeXmacs is already depends
on X-windows and sets up this environment more or less
automatically.

Yes, I think there is likely to be a BIG demand for it.
Already the preliminary versions of Axiom for windows have
been downloaded more that 550 times in just 20 days. See

http://page.axiom-developer.org/usage/usage_200412.html#TOPURLS

and the daily rate of downloads continues to be quite high.
I would fully expect that considerably more than half of
these windows users would prefer the TeXmacs interface to
Axiom over the limitations of the native Axiom interface.

The NSIS installed that Dan Martens uses with WinTexmacs
and which he helped me setup for Axiom does a remarkably
good job of compressing binary files (typically as much
as 1/10 the original size). So I expect a combined TeXmacs+
Axiom for Windows would be less than 40 Mb. in size - not
too bad for those with high speed connections.

I would be very interested if you could prepare such a
combined installer.

There used to be such functionality in zwiki...that I removed.
It was mangling emails when a zwiki page was used as a mailing list.

line wrapping is fine as long as it is done by the diff piece or
web-form submit piece.  Just don't mangle incoming emails.  ;)

The code is at the end of Mail.py, formatMailout() and in my codebase,
and there are some relevant things in tests/testMail.py.  If you have
any trouble locating the old code, shoot me an email and I'll send it to
you.

I honestly don't remember now how to trigger the email mangling...

It is only in the cycle mailin->mailout that the format must be
preserved (e.g. it was sent by a mailer it must be formatted correctly
as an email so let's not mess with it).  Do with you will with
wiki-generated content.

The problem is that the code does not have a way (currently) of
differentiating the source of the content to be mailed out, and was
line-wrapping whatever it saw, whether email/diff/new page etc.

I agree. What I had in mind would apply only to the emails
generated as diffs. After I thought about this a little
more, I realize that you may be right to imply that doing
this folding in a naive manner on text with a complex
format might well mangle some things badly. On the other

format (by design) so in most cases folding this (or diffs
of this) should not make things too unreable - especially
if I try to maintain the indent level if it is structured

Subject: RE: windows/linux coherency

Michel,

I have uploaded a new version of tm_axiom to

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/tm_axiom.zip

This version reads several default options from the TM_AXIOM
environment variable in the manner that you suggested.

Default options can be specified by the environment variable:

  export TM_AXIOM='break 1, over 1, cdot 1, space 0, big( 1, width 4.500'

The above values are the defaults if TM_AXIOM does not exist.
If TM_AXIOM already exist but does not contain parameters of
this exactly this format, then these other parameters are
silently ignored.

The default options can be overridden by on the command line:

  tm_axiom 'break 1, over 1, cdot 1, space 0, big( 1, width 4.500'

This would require modification of the scheme code in TeXmacs
that starts tm_axiom.

And these options can also be modified dynamically via a
simulated Axiom command:

  )set output texmacs break on, over on, cdot on, space off,
                      big( on, width 4.500

I said 'simulated' since although the syntax of this command
looks very much like an Axiom command, it is actually processed
only by the tm_axiom interface program.

  )set output texmacs

with no options display the current values of the options.

The available options and their defaults are as follows:

  break <on>|<off>  line-break algorithm                on
  over <on>|<off>   do not convert 2-d \over to 1-d /   on
  cdot <on>|<off>   do not convert \cdot to \ (space)   on
  space <on>|<off>  convert \ (space) to \,             off
  big( <on>|<off>   do not convert \left( \right to ( ) on
  width <9.99>      line width in inches                4.5

You may use 1 yes or on and 0 no or off.

---------

I also found and corrected a bug in the previous version
that prevented non-TeX output from being displayed. Now
it is possible to write:

  )set output tex off
  )set output algebra on
  )set output length 70

then the output of Axiom will be displayed in the same
"ascii format" used in the native Axiom text only interface.

You might like to note that by increasing the line width,
e.g.

  )set output texmacs width 5.0

the oddly folded format of your integrate( ... -1/3 ...)
variant of the first example in the AXIOM book now looks
normal. Perhaps we should make the default width a little
larger? However I am still unable to find any combination
of options that compensates for the TeXmacs problem with
the actual first example itself.

I will also shortly upload a complete new version of Axiom for
Windows

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/tm_axiom.zip

which includes this new version of tm_axiom.

I look forward to your comments on whether this new version
of tm_axiom will meet your needs for the Rosetta CD.

Bill Page.

No. This command is actually implemented as part of the
tm_axiom TeXmacs-Axiom interface program. I have not yet
added this program to axiom--windows--1 but I think that
it is time to do that real soon now. I propose to create
a texmacs directory under src and wrap the .c files into
.c.pamphlet format. And then the compile step to the
<<windows>> section of the Makefile.pamphlet.

I think we should place the executable tm_axiom.exe in
mnt/windows/bin. Is that ok?

Also, we need to put the axiom.nsi script for the NSIS
installer somewhere in the axiom--windows--1 tree. Of
course it also can become axiom.nsi.pamphlet but I am a
little uncertain where it should go especially if we
consider the possibility that we may also want to
 provide a linux installer for Axiom. Unfortunately NSIS
is not available for Linux and the only good one I know
for Linux (InstallAnywhere) is not open source, but I
have been looking at a couple of java-based open source
installers that might work well. I am not sure though
that we want to assume that the user has java has installed?
Do you have any installer programs for Linux that you would
recommend.

We should have an rpm package. Best of all if it would install on many 
distributions - RedHat, SUSE, Mandrake. A deb package for Debian and an 
.ebuild for Gentoo would be also useful.

As a Linux sysadmin, I'd at no circumstances install something using some 
funny "installer" on my rpm-based system, or on Debian, or Gentoo.

Do you know how to create an rpm that works on all three
"rpm-style" distributions? Or do you know a good "how-to"
document? Would you be willing to help me prepare such an
rpm for Axiom on Linux?

Oh ya, 3 different installer systems for 5 different
"linux" systems - that's progress. ;)

Debian we already have - Thanks to Camm Maguire.

Fedora has some variant of apt-get doesn't it? I don't
suppose a Debian/Fedora package is possible though, eh?

Maybe that's why there are so few linux systems running
Maple and such programs ... :?) I understand your
reluctance but as long as the installer is open source
and widely used, I don't see any real problem - except
of course that as far as I have been able to determine
there are no such installer programs yet.

I used RedHat for years, and made my own rpms for it. Not difficult. At 
the moment, it would be easy to produce an rpm which would work on RHEL3 
and similar systems, and on Fedora - they are quite similar. "Native" 
Mandrake rpms typically use a lot of Mandrake-specific macros, and won't 
build on RedHat. In the other direction, things must be much easier, and 
most probably a RedHat rpm will be OK for Mandrake and its derivatives 
(ALTLinux etc.). Haven't much experience with SUSE other as a 
non-priviledged user (I'm writing this at a SUSE box), cannot say about 
constructing rpms for it.

> Debian we already have - Thanks to Camm Maguire.
Yes, this is very good. So, Debian, Ubuntu etc. people can rest assured 
:-)

No. Fedora uses apt-get to install rpms, not debs.

If you focus on a binary only install then for the most
part you don't have to worry about the build. All you have
to do is get the contents of the mnt/linux directory stuffed
into the right corners of that particular system.

Still sounds overly cautious to me. That is exactly the

I can take a stab at an ebuild, but it might be a bit of a long process

installing Axiom anyway, and (knock on wood) my system updates are

Ok, great. I think that making such an rpm would indeed be
good progress. Would it be possible for you to do a "first
draft" of such an rpm? Then you could send it to me and
I could see if I understand the process and try to install
it on one of my RedHat systems.

Ok, that can be a secondary goal.

No problem. I know several people are using Axiom successfully
built from source on Suse. I think there was a significant
issue regarding clib or some such.

RPM for suse could be goal #3.

Yes, that would be the "wimp out" way ;-).  It cuts against the grain
though - part of Gentoo is being able to build everything you possibly
can from source.  (Some people argue this improves performance - I like
it because it ensures everything you'll ever need for developing
anything is present, and the system is entirely self contained in the
sense it can recreate itself from source code.)

I'm not up to doing proper autoconf/automake stuff, but I may try to
hack up something to be able to use the more normal install commands. 
Fortunately the ebuild system allows local gentoo specific patches, so
any hackish stuff I do stays contained.

Very little, given a proper setup, but part of a distribution specific
package is that you can be pretty sure things are well integrated with
your "working environment", so to speak.  For example, the Maxima
ebuild integrates emacs support for Maxima into its logic, so if you
have told the system to install emacs specific components everything is
handled for you.  No "generic" installer would likely handle this,
since gentoo's emacs system is (AFAIK at least) unique.  So I would
have to figure out what the installer did by hand, and tweak it to
work.  At that point, I might as well build and install it myself, sans
installer.  Also, what about package upgrades in the future?  Will a
generic installer handle that cleanly?  What about removal? 
Dependancies?  All these things are handled by the various
distributions.  Frankly, I think Redhat, Mandrake, Debian, and Gentoo
users have much better reasons than Windows folk to prefer local
packages - the benefits are considerable.  Pretty much any mess in
Linux due to non-standard stuff can be cleaned up, but the process can
be rather painful.

However, there is no harm in creating such a package - if people using
more obscure systems prefer an installer to building it themselves, it
doesn't hurt to have that option available.

Typically, once a package is created for a distribution and the rough
spots ironed out, it's fairly straightforward to maintain that package
in the future barring major changes.

That's good news. I am also hoping to build a Solaris

I might be necessary for you to set the the 'LISP' variable
differently in root Makefile.pamphlet in the section
<<Makefile.sol9gcc>> (Is this a new section that you have
defined for Solaris 9?)

The variable LISP is supposed to be set to the part of
the lisp file name after the last .

See for example the section <<Makefile.axposf1v3>> where
LISP=lisp in contrast in <<Makefile.linux>> where
LISP=lsp

You can try editing the Makefile.pamphlet and repeating
the make.

I hope that helps.

libintl. internationalization. got it.

there was an effort to internationalize axiom.
i collected most of the message strings into a file
and they are now looked up by hash-table.

the idea was to look at the locale variable and try to use a
different language for the messages. this was in the very early
days of internationalization.

the main sticking point is that i only speak one language 
so there wasn't much chance of any other translations given

C Y,

Congratulations on the Axiom ebuild. Good work!

The 11-15 tarball is already getting a little dated and
I think that it probably does not have graphics. The
best definition of what constitues Axiom 3.0 beta is the
contents of the CVS on Savannah. Perhaps you should point
your ebild to the nightly CVS tarball on Savannah instead:

  http://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs-backup/axiom-sources.tar.gz

The command /usr/bin/axiom will not start Axiom in graphics
mode. This script has not yet been updated. To use graphics
the script must run sman instead of AXIOMsys.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Eeek.  I don't think that will work - there are special provisions for
CVS ebuilds, and IIRC it's a bit of a headache in some cases.  Then,
too, gentoo will mirror the file on many servers, and in such a case
the updates probably won't be mirrored.  Also, the digest would have to
be continually rebuilt each night.  Yuck.  It would be better to have
one tarball which constitutes the 3.0beta, or I suppose it could wait
for 3.0 final.  I'll leave it where it is for now, since on my machine
at least it builds :-).  I suspect the ebuild will likely need a little
polishing before it goes "live" (certainly in the DEPENDS section), and
that way people will have a nice incentive to upgrade to 3.0 final so
we don't get outdated bug reports.

I take it the intent is to update the script at some point?  End users
are going to expect /usr/bin/axiom to do the job, at least by 3.0
final. (If not I can always patch it, I suppose.)

The plan is to update savannah on the first of every month.
We could put a tarball together of that build and keep it on mathaction.

The answer it gives is correct (unless there is a new bug introduced
that is not on my axiom 0.20040831-1).  The gamma function has sqrt(pi)
for half-integer values.

\begin{axiom}
integrate(x^2*(exp(-x^2)), x=0..%plusInfinity)
Gamma(3/2)/2::Float
sqrt(%pi)/4::Float
\end{axiom}

What I don't understand is why the integration result is so hard to
convert to a Float.  Appending '::Float' to the 'integrate()' command
fails.  Why?  If I type 'Gamma(3/2)/2' by hand it has no problem.

Subject: Re: Ebuild / Versioning

Dear CY, dear Tim, *

the original plan concerning the recent release was to call it 3.0
BETA. However it seems that there were different versions available at
different places: MathAction Linux, MathAction Windows, Savannah.

At least one person (Meino) got a CVS ("axiom-2004-11-15") were graphics are
missing. Obviously, I should have checked myself that all versions were the
same, except *documented* differences. I'll learn.

So I think that -- according to Tims plan -- the update on savannah first
January will be still a 3.0BETA (or 3.0GAMMA, if you like). I'd argue that 3.0
should be a version were

* builds on all architectures were it should without depending on the knowledge
  of axiom-developer.

* all patches are reviewed and applied if appropriate, implying that the
  algebra on windows and linux are the same. As far as I know, Bill Page is
  already working on this.

* contains a clear label in the banner (i.e: AXIOM Computer Algebra System 3.0)

and I'd hope that this version would be out just before February.

A nice add on would be a future release plan, as done for maxima, that tells
users what changes / features they can expect from the next version.

It is possible to convert this peculiar monogram to \Gamma for
display but I think the problem is more fundamental. Clearly AXIOM
does not have a consistent and complete representation of the Gamma
function. I think integrate should at least return a Gamma that can
be converted to Float or something of type Expression Integer like
sqrt(%pi)/4. But it seems that the current Gamma function always
agressively returns a DoubleFloat value. This doesn't seem very
useful to me for symbolic computations.

Bill, What is the type that is returned there?  How can I get axiom to
print the entire type rather than '...'?

I think therein lies the problem.  Note that
\begin{axiom}
integrate(x^2*(exp(-x^2)), x=0..%plusInfinity)::InputForm
\end{axiom}
seems correct.

P.S. IssueTracker + axiom rules.  Having axiom right here is so
powerful...  I will have to pay more attention to IssueTracker.  I was
half thinking to strip it when (if) I fork zwiki.  Right now
IssueTracker is a big hack that can't be uninstalled...

Too difficult? No, I think (at least from 10 years experience with
AsTeX) that it's sufficient to indicate the procedure in the user's
manual and recall it eventually in a FAQ. The discussion list can
solve last problems for those who don't read manuals and don't know
all options of Windows. The only potential problem I would see is to
know whether user's modifications can be harmful or not : for env
vars, I think they can't because there is a well-defined procedure in
Windows to modify them that avoids regedit, and because TM_AXIOM is a
variable specific to AXIOM (e.g.  modifying the PATH env var could be
considered as more "dangerous", as it is shared by many other
programs).

At installation time. It is possible to enter this as a new key in the
registry, or in autoexec.bat. And if there will be an axiom.ini, it
would be possible to read it from the installed axiom.ini.

Great! I downloaded the latest version and it reads OK the parameter
value. Maybe it would be useful to add in the doc that it is necessary
to got out of TeXmacs and rerun it, to take into account a
modification?

Unfortunately, it seems that it is still necessary that axiomsys.exe
be either in the PATH or in the texmacs/plugins/axiom/bin directory. I
succeeded in making nevertheless Axiom run inside TeXmacs and keeping
axiomsys.exe in the Axiom tree, by adding an axiomsys.bat in the
TeXmacs\plugins\axiom\bin directory, then changing the bat extension
into exe extension, but it's a rather dirty and temporary hack. I
think it would be better if tm_axiom could find the true binary
axiomsys.exe from $AXIOM\bin.

I am sorry to insist on having (if possible) axiomsys.exe NOT run from
the PATH.  I know it's rather orthogonal to the usual practice on
Unixes, but on these systems there is a superuser that is supposed to
"know" and install everything cleanly. On Windows, users often install
themeselves, and they can install different versions or different
distributions of a given program, so that, if several binaries with
the same name are in the PATH, it can produce very strange
results. This is a classical problem e.g. for TeX distributions (and I
solved the pb in AsTeX in this way, so that it is compatible with all
other TeX installations, even if they use the PATH).

- For the "l" and "c" parameters in Sutor's output, these are the
"left" and "center" parameters of the array environment. In Sutor's
output, the "l" is used, but it is rendered centered inside TeXmacs,
as if the "c" parameter was used instead, so I suspect it is a bug in
TeXmacs import filter.

- For the output with nested arrays (in the example with -1/3 power), the structure is 
the following:

begin array
- 
   begin array 
     text
    \\
    \\
    text
  end array
text
end array

I think it ought to be either

begin array
- 
   \left( begin array 
     text
    \\
    \\
    text
  end array\righ)
text
end array

to be correct, and I supposed that, if the original form was intended
(i.e. with no \left( and \right)) then probably it ought to be

begin array
- 
   begin array 
     text
    \\
    text
  end array
    \\
ext
end array

i.e. the second \\ in the first array would seem to be incorrectly
placed.

Another reason I would suppose the original form is not what was
intended : the motivation for using a LaTeX array seems to be to break
a long line into several small ones. So :

- if one breaks a long part into 3,
- and then adds the sequel after the block of 3 lines on the same line,

it seems rather contradictory ?  But of course, it is just a supposition.

Your last question, about the possibility to run TeXmacs + Axiom
directly from the CD : yes, it works with apparently no problem
(although I did not test it very much).

And a last point about axiom.ts : I think there might be a problem on
Windows : the type is still written just after the number of the
formula, not on the next line. Is your modified axiom.ts supposed to
write it on the next line, or did I understand you incorrectly?
(sorry, I don't write from my PC, I answer just from memory - it might
be deficient :-))

Well, there wasn't a whole lot of expertise involved - it was basically
trial and error until I found the set of ebuild incantations that
worked.  Think of it as writing a configure or make script, only
simpler.  The only tricky part was figuring out how and where to set
the AXIOM and PATH variables - with that attended to, everything else
is pretty much in the Axiom build scripts' ballpark.  I was afraid it
would be hard, but on the whole it's quite simple thanks to Axiom's
self-contained build nature.

>From here on, it will basically be tweaking the ebuild to adapt to any
changes in the Axiom build process, providing patches if needed, and
figuring out the proper dependancies to list.  Typically this is done
on the bugs.gentoo.org site, with some help from upstream if they are
interested and the bug is non-ebuild specific.  Gentoo users often have
newer libraries than average, so they sometimes hit unusual problems.

> In fact, eventually a 'make ebuild' is probably in order.

Uh...  I'm not really sure if a "make ebuild" command would make any
sense.  An ebuild is, in some sense, a gentoo-specific set of building
instructions, unlike deb and rpm files which are actual bundles of the
software.  It's (probably) not something Axiom will need to distribute
- once the set of instructions is put in the gentoo ebuild tree, if
someone wants to install axiom the ebuild essentially tells the
computer what to do.  If patch files are needed to the base tarball,
those are provided as well. Essentially, an ebuild has the following
information:

a)  where to download the software (providing a gentoo mirror doesn't
have it, if it does it is downloaded from there first.)

b)  Any support software needed (X, tetex, etc)

b)  how to unpack and configure the software for building, including
any patches needed for gentoo specifically

c)  how to build it, and install it

So in essence, Axiom doesn't have to worry about the ebuild except to
have someone check that everything is working.  Gentoo takes the
vanilla release tarball, and works with that to make things happen.  If
you're familiar with the BSD ports tree, gentoo uses the same basic
idea.  For example, with the current ebuild in bugzilla I have one
patch which changes the ./configure options for gcl.  Normally this is
not needed, but on gentoo system the more conservative settings are
needed, so I provide a patch making this change.  With
axiom--main--1--patch--18 the gcl settings have moved, so I created a
new patch for that.  (I've yet to complete a successful ebuild with
axiom--main--1--patch--18, so I'm not sure if something else will be
needed.  At one point the Axiom terminal interface popped up and CPU
and disk activity went to zero, which doesn't seem right.)  Other than
that, if all that needs to be done is change the location of the
tarball in the ebuild, point it to the new patches, and away it goes.

That said (pant pant), did you have something specific in mind for
"make ebuild" Tim?  Just because I don't see it doesn't mean I'm not
missing something.

Now, in some cases there are binary ebuilds that are maintained as
alternatives to the source ebuilds, in the case of VERY large software
like OpenOffice.  I don't know whether one is needed for Axiom - I
suspect the users will let us know. :-).

CY

P.S.  Oh, one other neat feature - as Axiom becomes known to compile on
other platforms than x86 (maybe it already does?) there are flags in
the ebuild which can be set to indicate it works on, say PPC.

The axiom mechanism for this is to modify the Makefile.pamphlet to
introduce a new <<makefile.gentoo>> chunk. Then gentoo users would
set the AXIOM variable to:

AXIOM=`pwd`/axiom/mnt/gentoo
                      ^^^^^^
                       this selects the makefile.gentoo chunk
which is where you would put the new .configure



Also, the 'pop up a terminal and hang' issue seems to have something
to do with a race condition. Graphics works and it is running some
graphics input test file (likely wiggle.input). If the graphics window
does not start, say because you do not have xhost permission to open
a window, then the build hangs.

Hmm.  OK, this should work - I guess the thing to do is check that the
latest monthly release builds using this section on an up to date
gentoo install before bumping the ebuild version number.

That's probably it.  This will most likely be a problem, because AFAIK
there isn't any way to insist that emerge has access to an X server. 
(In fact, in many situations it definitely won't.)  Is there a toggle
that could be set to build the graphics, but not run the live test?

For the moment I did a xhost +localhost to (hopefully) allow things to
proceed - I'll let you know if it makes it the rest of the way. 
Impressive stuff Tim - I'm really looking forward to trying out
graphics :-).  Thanks for all your hard worK!

Note of course that the syntax has changed a little to
conform to the Axiom )set output command. So the above

TM_AXIOM='breaker no'

tm_axiom already finds axiomsys.exe from $AXIOM\bin. tm_axiom
does not use the PATH.

The problem that you are having is that TeXmacs itself is looking
for AXIOMsys as a sign that it should include Axiom in the
Insert/Session menu. It serves no other purpose so your hack is
not so bad. TeXmacs also looks for tm_axiom in the PATH but
TeXmacs adds
 texmacs/plugins/axiom/bin
to the PATH variable locally before doing the search so if
you move tm_axiom here (as is usual in TeXmacs installations)
then you will not have a problem.

In the windows Axiom installer puts tm_axiom in the
  $AXIOM/mnt/windows/bin
directory since it can not be sure whether TeXmacs is present or
not. The current native Windows version of TeXmacs does not
include any tm_axiom binary, but as long as the PATH includes
  $AXIOM/mnt/windows/bin
then everything works.

I understand. That is not a problem I said above. To correct
this behaviour requires a change to the axiom_init script in
TeXmacs so that it not longer looks for AXIOMsys. Maybe it
should look for the AXIOM environment variable instead. But
right now I do not know enough about scheme scripts in TeXmacs
to make even this simple change.

If
  $AXIOM/mnt/windows/bin
is not in the PATH, then right now I can only think of one
minor problem that would affect the way AXIOM works. The current
version of AXIOM for Windows expects to be able to run a program
called 'cat' (after the unix command of the same name), it order
to display some help files. In the current version there is a
simple 'cat.exe' program in 
  $AXIOM/mnt/windows/bin
that does the job. I think you will have to move this to
  texmacs/plugins/axiom/bin
so that the )summary command will work in your CD configuration.

Yes, that is what the modified axiom.ts does. It forces the
Type: information to a new line. In order to use it, you
*must* replace the existing axiom.ts in TeXmacs with the
new one manually copied from
  $AXIOM\mnt\windows\src\texmacs
To just install AXIOM for windows alone is not enough. I do not
know how to make this automatic.

Crud.  For the record, it also failed in a straight build, same

Well, I did that and ran the sman command from the temp build directory

Copy the makefile.linux and change the config line.

If you send me the config line I'll patch axiom--main--1 to handle gentoo.

The wiggle problem is one I'm chasing but have no resolution yet.
Likely I'll just skip graphics testing during build because it
raises a lot of issues (such as automated builds that don't have

I very much second this request. In many cases (e.g., Debian with all its

Hmm, in fact I usually send it to Tim Daly. I thought you were just too

If there are no comments within the next few hours, I'll send out

adresses.

Furthermore, there will be a proposal for a new FrontPage on

shortly. I thought a little about a sensible structure, unfortunately I left
the notes at home, so I can only tell you that I arrived something more or less
OK... I found that it's not that easy, since there are several different "User"
profiles:

* the sponsor who wants to check that his name is mentioned often enough, and
  maybe is interested in some superficial facts

* the guy passing by, who is mainly interested in some superficial facts, but
  might want to try it out.

* the newbie looking for help solving his homework

* the advanced user, who is looking for something very specific

* the developer...

If you like it, I'll make it the "real" FrontPage and you can then make
MathAction the new homepage. In any case, I will have transferred everything
until tomorrow morning.

Great. I suspect this will make most of the build troubles go away. However,
(just as a reminder) please call it BETA (or nothing at all) until the proposed

Is it possible to "export" the list of bugs from savannah somehow?

And since I still didn't get an answer: what about bug #5977 ? Do you have a
patch lying around somewhere. If not, we really should "reopen" it!

Another bug issue: The possibility of using axiom to demonstrate failures in

Umm, I don't propose to call it anything. I leave that up to the director
of marketing. I'm going to download, build, and test axiom--main--1 on
all the platforms I have available and, if it passes, promote it to 
savannah. Then I need to grab the savannah copy and redo the testing to
ensure I didn't make a mistake. Following that we have to chase down all
of the binaries and upgrade them. 

I don't yet have the ability to do this for the windows versions. We
need to get the scripts in place so I can automate the task but
probably not for this version as it is bad practice to change anything
at the last minute.

>Is it possible to "export" the list of bugs from savannah somehow?

By hand, I'd assume. Bug tracking has traditionally been done in the
input subdirectory. Several files there have bug fixes with listed
dates as well as some known bugs that are pre-NAG. Besides, these
bugs need to be better documented. I've been so busy making new bugs
and killing them before they get off my desk to concentrate on the
outstanding bugs.

>And since I still didn't get an answer: what about bug #5977 ? Do you have a

It appears that the problem is a semantic one. The listed "bug" is
requesting that (x^2) be added to 1::DMP([x],INT) rather than
(x^2+1)::DMP([x],INT), which works.

YES, but it's clearly marked as "closed". I didn't know that
(x^2+1)::DMP([x],INT) didn't work once upon a time, but #5977 says that
x^2+1::DMP([x],INT) doesn't work. PLEASE reopen it! (I don't have permission on
savannah.)

It seems so: Bill installed IssueTracker on MathAction, which might serve as a
replacement for the savannah bug list. You can look at it by pressing "issues"
at the top left in MathAction.

all worked!


This bug also exists in the NAG version, where the first (2) would give "Memory
access violation detected".  Two observations: (a) the coercion in (2), shows
the interpreter does not follow the two steps in (3); and (b) the problem is
specific to POLY INT. It may also have to do with the second (2), and my
suspicion is that it has to do with a combination of the interpreter, POLY, DMP,
INT, no variables, and may be POLYLIFT or MLIFT.

Tim: can you do a boot trace of (4) and compare that with any of the others that
work?

Subject: Re: code release: Bug#5977

I looked at this a little bit further:

it might be that there is an error in mainVariable$SMP, but more likely, the
bug is earlier in the history. mainVariable$SMP is called from coerce$POLY,
interestingly without checking that the result of mainVariable might be
"failed". I added some debugging infos:

      mainVariable p ==
	 output("mainVariable1$SMP")$OutputPackage
         p case R => 
           output("mainVariable2$SMP")$OutputPackage
           output(p::R::OutputForm)$OutputPackage
           "failed"
	 output("mainVariable3$SMP")$OutputPackage
         res := p.v
	 output("mainVariable4$SMP")$OutputPackage
	 print(res)$Lisp
         p.v

Then we get

(65) -> 1::DMP([x],INT)::POLY INT

   coerce$POLY
   mainVariable1$SMP
   mainVariable3$SMP
   mainVariable4$SMP
 
   >> System error:

Oh, that reminds me.  Is there a way to have Axiom display a "version"
as well as a build date?  Remember in the case of Gentoo a user (or for
that matter anybody building their own cvs checkout) reporting a bug +
build date could be totally useless - their build date won't have
anything to do with the pre-compiled binaries or possibly even the cvs
checkout date.

Tim,

Please let me know when you are planning to finalize the
Jan 1, 2005 Savannah CVS. It would be good, I think it we could
include as many of these Savannah patches as possible in this
release. I have almost completed testing of the first four
patches below and I plan to update the axiom--main--1 archive
later today.

Martin,

I have been looking at the patches that you submitted some time
ago on Savannah. Thank you very much for taking the time to make
these corrections. Some of these are straight forward such as:

#2074:  Bug #4733 (rounding of negative numbers) [AS]
#3089:  bug #6357 sqrt(-1/abs(x))-1/sqrt(-abs(x))=>0 [A]
#3121:  [bugs #9057] product over product or sum fail [A]
#3349:  bug #10312 Problems raising a UTS to a negative integer power  [A]

I do have some questions about the status of some others. From
the comments it is not clear to me that the proposed patches are
complete:

#3127:  bug #9297 -- output misses parenthesis in COMBF [A]
#3148:  bug #9216 differentiating sums with respect to a bound is wrong [A]
#3161:  any? and every? should exit when the result is clear [A]

Also, you submitted these as direct patches to the .spad files.
Really you should be patching the .spad.pamphlet files. And it
would be **very desirable** if in the future you could also include
some new documentation in the .spad.pamphlet file describing the
problem and the nature of the change. Most of the documentation
is still missing for the algebra files, so if you learn something
new while analysing a problem, it would be great to capture this
and add and/or revise the documentation for future generations.

This one seems to have been anonymously submitted, but it looks
ok to me.

#3311:  bug #10069 overview: cot(0.0), csc(0.0), asec(0.0),
acsc(0.0),asech(0.0),acsch(0.0),cot(0.0),coth(0.0),acoth(0.0) [A]

the patch does the straightforward thing: it always adds parentheses around a
sum and a product. In certain cases, the parentheses might not be strictly
necessary, but with the patch the output is always mathematically correct. I'd
say that it could be a *future* project to improve output.

 > #3148:  bug #9216 differentiating sums with respect to a bound is wrong [A]

in my opinion correct beyond doubt.

 > #3161:  any? and every? should exit when the result is clear [A]

I don't have the time to look it up right now, whether the "mixed" behaviou
TREE would vanish with this patch or not. In any case, this "bug" will never
produce mathematically incorrect results. It will only waste cpu cycles. In
fact, I included the comment regarding TREE only to document that if there
would be code that depends on the "evaluate all" code, it wouldn't work with
TREE anyway, so it would be broken already. Bottom line: no danger.

Yes. 100% correct.

Absolutely right. I promise to deliver documentation before 3.0 i.e., before
February. (In fact, the reason was that I was waiting for pamphlet support on
mathaction... I had the feeling it would be easier to document then.)

Shouldn't that mean coerce$POLY should be fixed to check the "failed" case?
Which coerce$POLY is that?

Very interesting.
Of course, this is another (perhaps related, but perhaps not) bug that seems to
point to coerce$POLY. Another surprise (in the sense of tracing the bug):

1::DMP([x], FRAC INT)::POLY INT

returns 1 (correctly).

By (66), FRAC is involved in the bug as well.

Now p is declared in multpoly.spad as Union(R, VPoly).
So the code mainVariable p seems to be correct, but your debug info

suggests that when 1$DMP([x], INT) is passed on to coerce$(POLY INT) and then to
mainVariable$SMP as p, it is recognized as "case VPoly". So that must be where
the bug is, in coerce$(POLY INT).
I think p is correctly passed, based on:

>    1
>

>    (67)  1

where mainVariable2$SMP is printed, and that coerce$(POLY FRAC INT) then handles
the case correctly.

The puzzle is that coerce$POLY is defined independent of R, but yet R affects
the correctness of the output. I would be surprised if 1$DMP([x],INT) is passed
correctly in one case but not the other because of the target POLY has different
parametric domains. It that were the case, the culpit would be the interpreter.
Unfortunately, I think trying testing this same bug in the compiler would not
work because these coercion statements are not specific enough for the compiler,
but it may be worth trying because of (66).

Martin, can you also post the debug code inserts for coerce$POLY?

Tim,

When I did a new windows build today, I noticed that it no
longer runs the input test files at all. Is this intentional?
The tla cat-log patch-8 only says: "The input directory needs
to occur after all of the other directories." Did you mean
by this to delay running the tests or is something broken?

BTW, I think the best way to run the tests in input might be
a separate 'make' step like this

  make test

Several open source packages that I have built recently have
had such an optional make step between the 'make' and the
'make install'. This would solve the problem with building
Axiom on systems without X-windows, since there could also
be an optional step like

  make test-graphics

there is a partially implemented feature

i haven't yet finished the propagation of this feature. once it exists
you can build any subdir, such as 

make PART=graph

Tim,

I guess what happens is the build fails (as it always
has) at trying to build clef.

clef can not be easily made to run on windows and in any
case it is superfluous just as on linux because windows
effectively has it's own equivalent of readline.

I will try it again without clefdir, graphdir, and smandir
since at this point I don't think any of these will compile
under windows.

[A] means assigned to me, [S] means submitted by me. This was
copied from my summary page on Savannah. Each developer can
maintain such a list if this wish.

I am still not clear about this one. Are you saying that
the output is ambiguous in some cases because of missing
parenthesis but that internally the result is correct?
If so, then I think I would prefer to wait for someone to
come up with a general solution rather than to do now
what seems like a "quick-and-dirty fix". In my experience
quick-and-dirty has a habbit of becoming almost permanent.
I think one can see evidence of this having happened to
Axiom in the past.

In the patch report you wrote:

"Mathematically axiom produces correct output now, however
I'm not sure whether my patch is best possible.

Maybe there should be a function D in OutputForm that displays
unevaluated differentiation. Also, I find it ugly to use the
raw %diff operator in COMBF. Furthermore, is it necessary to
substitute a dummy variable for the variable of differentiation?"

I am concerned that this is another case of a "quick fix" for
which we should consider a more general solution of the kind
that you suggest above.

My philosphy is something like this: While I agree that
mathematical correctness should have a very high priority
in Axiom, that correctness should always be achieved in the
most generally applicable manner as possible. Otherwise one
runs the risk of becoming trapped by many "little decisions"
that never let the "grand ideas" achieve their full potential.
I think this has already happened to most other computer
algebra systems.

Can we be sure that functions applied during evaluating 'any?'
and 'every?' are not being executed for their side-effects?
I worry that changing the semantics here could have unexpected
effects in other places in Axiom where 'any?' and 'every?' are
used.

I am not convinced. I think this needs more analysis, i.e. look
at each case were 'any?' and 'every?' are actually used or else
we have to be prepared to do a lot of testing.

Of course I agree that it is wrong. But what would you expect
the answer to be?

  conjugate(a)

could return unevaluated as just

  conjugate(a)

but then what should the Type: be? Is such an expression
still necessarily a Complex Polynomial Integer?

This is dangerously close to the discussion that we had some
months ago about the meaning of "indeterminants", objects
which have a type but no specific value. For example, I can
say

  A:Integer

but if I write

  A+1

If you answered "yes" to the idea that conjugate(a) is still
of type Complex Polynomial Integer, then surely A+1 is still
of type Integer is the same sense, but Axiom complains that
"A has not been given a value".

Perhaps evaluating the expression

  conjugate(a)

should also complain about the lack of a value?

seems to be a categorical error of some sort.

A: Complex Polynomial Integer

tells the system that 'A' is expected to have a value which is
Complex Polynomial Integer.

'conjugate' works on values, not potential values.

Thus, conjugate(A) has no meaning as 'A' has no value.
This should probably be an error.

If axiom could work with so that conjugate worked on the type
then axiom could work at some sort of an 'axiomatic' level
rather than a symbolic computation level. Perhaps when we join
forces with the ACL2 crowd we could state certain theorems and
have them applied in the absence of a value.

I know that this is opening up the whole big subject again,
but I do think that Axiom is already "two-faced" about this.

Consider for example that we can write:

(7) -> A: Complex Polynomial Integer
                                         Type: Void
(8) -> B: Complex Polynomial Integer
                                         Type: Void
(9) -> A+B

   (9)  B + A
                               Type: Complex Polynomial Integer

Neither A or B "has a value" but Axiom has no trouble agreeing
that A+B is still of type Complex Polynomial Integer.

I do not see any essential difference between this and

(10) -> A:Integer
                                         Type: Void
(11) -> B:Integer
                                         Type: Void
(12) -> A+B

   A is declared as being in Integer but has not been given a value.

Clearly you're right and I agree with you.

The problem, as I see it, is that there are subtle degrees of meaning
that are easily stepped around when you work on paper but must be
clarified in computational mathematics.

A: Integer

might mean that 1) 'A' will hold a value which is an integer
under interpretation (1)

A+1 

is an error since 'A' has no value. But what does the type of
an unbound thing mean? Lisp assigns types to the values, not
the boxes. This is like labeling a box 'television'.

or perhaps that 2) 'A' is an indefinite object of type integer
under interpretation (2)

A+1

is another indeterminant integer, where '+' comes from Integer.

or perhaps that 3) 'A' obeys the laws applied to integers
under interpretation (3)

A+1

is a polynomial with 2 integers, representing a constant, where
'+' comes from Polynomial.

or perhaps that 4) 'A' is a symbol which hold integers
under interpretation (4)

A+1

is a polynomial in A with integer coefficients ignoring 'A's type
where '+' comes from Polynomial.

or perhaps that 5) 'A' is an element of a Ring and theorems can be applied
under interpretation (5)

A+1

is 'B', a new member of the Ring since '+' is a ring operator and both
'A' and '1' are ring elements. Ideally Axiom's types would be decorated
with axioms, like the ring axioms making reasoning about unbound but
typed objects possible. The '+' comes from the Category axioms of Integer.


The exact interpretation chosen appears to be dictated by the 
underlying code and is not the same everywhere.

Axiom is the product of many people, some of whom have chosen
different interpretations. Indeed, some of the interpretations
didn't exist before the computational aspects of mathematics
came into play.

There are quite a few areas of research that could be followed.
Indeed, working out the implications of the several meanings of 
'A' is a PhD topic, and a rather hard one at that. The issue 
heads off into questions of provisos, questions of reasoning with
theorems and axioms, etc.

Axiom's main strength has always been as a research platform where
it is possible to work out these ideas and reduce them to practice.

Unfortunately, research funding seems nowhere to be found.

There are several patch-versions of axiom--main which are not
completely build-ready. The axiom--main branch is semi-stable.
I use it to build pre-savannah versions and there are a lot of
changes that go into it near the end of the month. In order to
guarantee that I've got a good build on axiom-main I repeat the
cycle:

do
 fix something
 build it
 tla commit to axiom-developer
 rm -rf axiom--main--1*
 tla get axiom--main--1
 build it
 test it
until done
if (end-of-month) and (stable)
 then promote to savannah CVS

This ensures that I'm not depending on local features but means
that axiom--main--1 might be unstable in various ways. 

By the way, please copy list as there are
other people on this list who know more than I do and can help.

Why cannot we allow *all*?  I expect I should be able to coerce 'A+1' to
an Integer, Polynomial Integer, Expression Integer, etc.  The default
seems to be Integer, which seems fine.

The error seems to be in the Polynomial domain:
    (16) -> c:Complex Integer           
                                                                       Type: Void
    (17) -> conjugate(c)     
     
       c is declared as being in Complex Integer but has not been given a 
          value.
    (17) -> c:Complex Polynomial Integer
                                                                       Type: Void
    (18) -> conjugate(c)

       (18)  c
                                                 Type: Complex Polynomial Integer

Adding the Polynomial to its domain causes this to go wrong...

    (19) -> c:Polynomial Complex Integer
                                                                       Type: Void
    (20) -> conjugate(c)
       There are 4 exposed and 1 unexposed library operations named 
          conjugate having 1 argument(s) but none was determined to be 
        ...

I'm surprised this doesn't work.  A Polynomial on a Ring is still a
member of that ring and should inherit its functions.  (in this case,
conjugate)  It also strikes me that Polynomial Complex Integer is the
proper type here, not Complex Polynomial Integer...clearly they are
inequivalent.

I cannot seem to construct an example of type (3).  Given: c:Integer and
I want to construct a Polynomial Integer containing 'c', how would I do
it?

The type of 'A' cannot be ignored since 'A+1' must Polynomial must have
a Field such as Integer in its constructor.

I think this *must* be clarified, and a unifying set of assumptions be
applied across all domains.

This does not seem so hard, but maybe I am being naive.

I cannot seem to construct an example of type (3).  Given: c:Integer and
I want to construct a Polynomial Integer containing 'c', how would I do
it?

The type of 'A' cannot be ignored since 'A+1' must Polynomial must have
a Field such as Integer in its constructor.

This does not seem so hard, but maybe I am being naive.

Well, I have successfully done 5 of the patches and tested
them in both Linux and Windows. I did an update and commit
to axiom--windows--1 with no problem. But I am having a lot of
trouble with arch on my linux system. Right now I am doing
a complete rebuild of the modified axiom--main--1 sources. On
this system it will take about 18 hours to finish. I am quite
sure it will build ok, but I just want to be sure. Then I can
(finally) do the commit. If this is outside your time frame
for the Jan 1 Savannah release, then I guess you should just
proceed anyway and we can catch up in February.

The problems with axiom--main--1 started because perhaps I did
things in the wrong order and was nervous about doing the Axiom
build in the arch directory.

On Windows I did make the changes in the arch directory and
re-compiled Axiom and tested right there. The tla update and
tla commit worked fine and did not do anything crazy like
committing any of the non-source files. I worked like a charm.
Good.

But on the linux system I first copied of the arch directory
and made all of my changes and built Axiom in that copy over
the last couple of weeks. Then I was faced with the problem of
merging these changes with the repository on axiom-developer.

I had originally downloaded the axiom--windows--1 using the http
protocol. This would not have allowed me to do a commit, so I
had to find out how to change the protocol to sftp (easy but not
well documented) without downloading everything again. Then I
did a tla update of the original arch directory with no problem.

But the diff with my modified source tree showed a couple of
possible conflicts with changes you have made. So my first attempt
was to try to apply the 'tla update' to my copy of the original
arch directory containing the changes. tla is supposed to be able
to resolve simple conflicts, right? But for some reason the 'tla
update' on the copy seems to take *forever* and downloads several
large patch files more than once. It has timed out twice on some 
etwork problem or other.

So now what I have done is to re-apply all of my changes form
my modified copy of the original arch directory back on the
updated original directory itself. And since I never built
Axiom in that directory before, I decided that I had better
"bite the bullet" and do the re-build again here just to make
sure that I didn't miss anything.

>From now one I think I am going to keep in simple and trust
this commit stuff to work properly with just one arch directory!

Subject: Re: Savannah patches

Bill,

I do all of my work in a separate copy. I generally do this to make
sure that I know what changes I've made and that I don't commit
non-working copies.

tla get axiom--something--1
   which gets the latest patch, lets call it patch-10. This is pristine

cp -pr axiom--something--1--patch-10 axiom
   which gives me a place to work
   NOTE THAT I DON'T WORK IN --patch-10 but in a copy

loop

  cd axiom
     do all my work in the copy, not the original

  diff -r --brief axiom--something--1--patch-10 axiom
     HAND PATCH the files that differ back into axiom--something--1--patch-10

     I hand patch so that I have to review each and every change.
     Sometimes I've made changes I dont' want to commit either because
     they are debugging (e.g. printf) or unrelated.

  rm -rf axiom
     remove the working copy

  cp -pr axiom--something--1--patch-10 axiom
     get a working copy with all my new patches

  cd axiom ; make
     rebuild the copy to make sure it works

until done

at this point axiom--something--1--patch-10 is the same as axiom 
and it has been tested. Now I can commit and move on:

cd axiom--something--1--patch-10
tla make-log
tla commit

rm -rf axiom--something--1--patch-10 
   remove --patch-10 because I've finished with it

tla get axiom--something--1 
   this is --patch-11 so I have the latest version

make
   and test to make sure I didn't commit garbage
   

assuming the tests work I can now use --patch-11 and fix the next problem

I've learned from past experience that 
  (a) I make mistakes and need to check myself a lot
  (b) I don't trust automated merge tools
  (c) I need to minimize commits that are broken

It is a tedious process but it works for me.

Your procedure is effectively what I have ended up doing by
default because once I made a copy of the arch directory,
the normal procedures no longer works efficently. But this
seems to me to be far less than optimal, painful and error
prone in it's own right. I think it is better to use the
tools the way they were designed to be used and if they
don't work, then I guess it's time to report a bug and/or
choose a new tool.

If doing development in Axiom is done it this painful sort
of way, then I fear that there may never be more than 1 & 1/2
developers ... :(

In contrast the changes I made to the Windows arch directory
where completely painless and the whole thing was done and
comitted in only a few hours.

BTW, I have never had this sort of problem using darcs. The
complexity of tla on top of everything else is daunting.

ah, we differ in philosophy and will never agree.

it is possible to work directly in an arch directory
and there are a lot of commands, like tla changes, etc
to figure out what's new, old, different, to merge branches,
to version, etc. you found it to be pleasant and useful
in the axiom-windows branch. the more you play with it
the less you'll think it's hard to use or broken.

the problem with my method of working isn't a flaw in arch
but a fundamental distrust of software. i've spent my life
fixing broken software and i'm always pleasantly surprised

Internally, the result is correct, however, the output is not only ambiguous, but wrong in some cases.

The fix is not dirty. It is quick and simple. It is not that easy to come up with a really good version, but I'd say that wrong output is unacceptable.

In this case the situation is a tiny little bit different, since here also Axioms internal representation is wrong. Worse: the design of Axioms Algebra currently doesn't provide "unevaluated differentiation". Obviously, it was thought that anything can be differentiated. In fact, I'm almost sure that attempting to differentiate a sum by one of its bound should signal an error, because it is impossible to assign a mathematically correct meaning to it. In this sense, I'd suggest that we aim to reach consensus until end of January.

I did some analysis and I'm quite sure that no code will be broken. However, this is a patch I won't push, since it won't produce incorrect results.

I'm pretty sure that the coercion to from DMP to POLY fails, without signalling an error, just like you could always do a "pretend". This would also explain (66)

Note that it is not possible to coerce a DMP or a UP or anything the like to a POLY in compiled code! Unfortunately I don't know where these interpreter coercions are coded. In any case, I'm convinced that they *should* be coded in the Algebra, not in the interpreter.

Note that coerce$POLY only coerces to OutputForm... No internal stuff done there. That's why I'm sure that it is an interpreter bug.

The binaries are not yet up to date with the savannah sources.
I'll finish as many as the cpu cycles allow but I'll be away from

Bug fixes discussed recently are not in the release due to discussion
of the proper fixes. Graphics is there but not integrated. Hypertex is

Many centuries ago, there used to be a problem in GCL about the number
of arguments that a compiled function could accept.


Error:  Lisps arglist maximum surpassed


In order to get around this problem there is a file called
src/interp/nocompil.lisp.pamphlet. I can't imagine how this
could ever be compiled as the makefile does not do it. The
file obj/sol9gcc/interp/nocompil.lsp should not have a
corresponding nocompil.o file. 

There is a function called |Join| which exceeds the GCL maximum.
I'm not sure why this shows up for you.

I'm a little lost here :-) I checked that indeed there is no
obj/sol9gcc/interp/nocompil.o.  Other than that, I could send the
whole output of make, if it would be helpful.
