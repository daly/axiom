I don't know if you're using the msys compiler under Windows.
I found a bug in the compiler (which cost me a week of debugging)
so I gave up on Windows. I can dig up the details of the bug from
my backups if you really want to get low-level.

The easiest way would be to compile Axiom on a linux box and copy the
lisp files. There is a file called src/interp/debugsys.lisp.pamphlet
which contains the files that get loaded into an image. I don't know if
it is up to date but it is close. Note that this loads the raw lisp.
You could edit it to do a compile-file for each file first.

The src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet will be put into src/interp/Makefile
and that contains the steps necessary to make "interpsys" which gets
renamed to "AXIOMsys".

Feel free to ask questions.

Tim

Subject: Vim syntax file


Some time ago I asked on the list if there was a syntax file to have vim 
input files highlighted in vim: the answer was no.
After some time, I built one myself.

Unlikely, I forgot to submit it so to share it with other interested 
people (if any...!)

I did it today: interested people can find it at

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4765

I also added highlighting for pamphlet files so you can have both 
latex and axiom code properly highlighted.

I think there is. People would have to waste time to test two options.
And it would certainly be easier for all if you could merge your vim
highlighting file with that on the axiom wiki. Would be a good idea to
upload all of that to your github account and do further development in
the public.

Just my 2 cents.

No problem.
I followed your suggestion and I had a look at the file on fricas page. It 
seems to me more sophisticated than mine. It also includes syntax for 
something else than axiom (C++, maybe?) so I don't think I can improve it.

I have only one remark: I used axiom to generate
categories/domains/packages/operators names. Are them exactly the same in 
fricas? I don't know this. From this point of view, maybe they can't be 
completely interchangeable.

Regards

Fabio

PS: I saw that you put a link to the vim page at the axiom-wiki page: I 
made the same at the vim page, where also I uploaded a cleaned up version 
of the file.

If I were you, I would simply write a little script that a user could
run on his/her machine and generated the respective lists of
categories/domains/... in a form appropriate for the vim-mode.

That's a good idea. Done by hand, the procedure is quite simple:

1)	In axiom:
 	)set output length  20
 	)spool cat.vim
 	)what cat
 	)spool
 	)spool dom.vim
 	)what dom
 	)spool
 	)spool op.vim
 	)what op
 	)spool
 	)spool pack.vim
 	)what pack
 	)spool

2) 	clean up top and bottom of every file

3)	Insert vim syntax:

 	sed  "s/\(^[a-zA-Z].*$\)/syn keyword axCategories \1/" cat.vim > categories.vim
 	sed  "s/\(^[a-zA-Z].*$\)/syn keyword axDomain \1/" dom.vim > domains.vim
 	sed  "s/\(^[a-zA-Z].*$\)/syn keyword axPackages \1/" pack.vim > packages.vim
   	sed  "s/\(^[a-zA-Z].*$\)/syn keyword axOperation \1/" op.vim | sed "s/\(^[^s].*$\)/syn match axOperation \"\\\\M\1\\\\m\"/"  > operations.vim

Step 3 is  already shell script.
Step 2 can be done if one assumes that the "garbage" in the spool 
is always the same: but is this true for all forks of axiom? I don't know.
Maybe in this step you still need to edit files by hand, at least to check
them.
And what about step 1? How can I start axiom with a input file in a shell
script?

What about the attached script?
It's developed with FriCAS, but would that work with AXIOM?

For simplicity, instead of axDomain, my script outputs axdomains.
That's easily fixable by introducing a third parameter to the keywords
shell function.

The operations.vim doesn't quite match. There are some places where in
your original file you have something like \M~=\m. Since I don't use
vim, I don't understand the differences.

Hopefully, this script also works for AXIOM and OpenAxiom.

Subject: Re: Vim syntax file

Fabio,

If you want the names of all of the categories, domains, and packages
(assuming you have axiom in a directory called axiom):

cd ~/axiom/books
fgrep abbrev bookvol10.2.pamphlet
fgrep abbrev bookvol10.3.pamphlet
fgrep abbrev bookvol10.4.pamphlet
fgrep abbrev bookvol10.5.pamphlet

10.2 is all the categories, 10.3 is all the domains,
10.4 is almost all the packages, 10.5 is the new numeric packages.

In addition, when these pamphlets (which are just standard latex
files) are run through latex they generate a .idx file (latex
index file) which can contain information you might find useful.
It is trivial for me to add index entries you might want.

The chunk environment is used in the above files not only to
delimit the algebra but also to delimit test cases for each
domain and the documentation for all of the files. These are
extracted, put into their appropriate place (int/input for
tests, mnt/system/doc/spadhelp for documentation) at build time.

Chunk mode is also used in all of the src/input examples,
unit test, and regression test source file pamphlets. These
contain both the Axiom input and expected output (prefixed
by --R comment markers).

You might want to look at the above files in vim to see
if you're handling the many uses of the chunk environment.

I'm surprised that you need a vim mode for FriCAS chunks.
It was my understanding that almost all of the source files
(except the algebra for some reason) were stripped of their
literate programming. I looked at the latest repository and
it appears that only the algebra has pamphlets.

Many centuries ago there was support for "tag files" which
would allow direct indexing into the sources. It is on my
list to recover that but everything has taken a back seat
to getting Albert Rich's test cases into the computer algebra
test suite.

When you are happy with your vim file send me a copy and 
I will add it to the zips directory in the distribution.

Ralph, thanks for the script.
If I got it right, I should call it as

./keywords.sh axiom

If it is like so, then unluckly it doesn't work with axiom: it produces 
four empty files.

In any case, I updated the files: I added syntax for system commands too 
and I added instructions to create owns  command syntax files.
Required user intervention is very limited and straightforward and I think 
that trying to eliminate it completely can be not worth of and, also, not 
completely deterministic, given the "garbage" in output spool files.

The \M stuff (which today I slightly modified) is somewhat necessary due 
to vim handling of regexps, to have a precise control of them regardless 
of users' settings.

Is there any difference between list of categories (for example) obtained 
with this method and the list obtained with
)what categories
?

Because if there is not, then it is more simple to handle the second file: 
less work is required.

I tried to edit the pamphlet and it seems to me that syntax is correctly 
hilighted.
For example, --R comments are treated just as -- comments.

Is this remark directed to me?

The version that I uploaded today seems to me complete enough.
If in the next days there is  no new remark on the list
which gives me some reason/hint to modify it, I don't think I will touch 
it any more: if you don't see any change for some weeks, you can download 
it and add it, if you want.

Just replace the keywords function by:

keywords () {
    echo ")what $1" | $EXE > $1.vim
}

And send my the 4 files.

Can you first check, whether

  echo ")what domains" | axiom -nosman

produces anything on your computer. The "-nosman" actually means to
directly call AXIOMsys. So if you do

export AXIOM=...
./keywords.sh $AXIOM/bin/AXIOMsys

(or whereever your AXIOMsys is), it might work.
But perhaps AXIOM has problems with redirects. (I would be surprised.)

Come on, for FriCAS, my keywords.sh script gets already rid of that
garbage automatically. One just has to play a bit with sed.
Semiautomatic stuff is pretty useless.

Could that be added to keywords.sh? Since I don't know vim, I wouldn't
know whether the result is right if I corrected keywords.sh myself.

They are all the same and they read

Unknown option: -nosman
To use a specific workspace use, e.g.: spad -ws -nosman
Goodbye.

It produces the same three lines as above

Sure they can: assuming that you have the files
cat.txt com.txt dom.txt pack.txt op.txt,
you just need


cat cat.txt  | sed  "s/\(^.*$\)/syn keyword axCategories \1/"  > categories.vim
cat com.txt  | sed "s/\s//g" | sed "s/\(^.*$\)/syn match axCommand \"\\\\V)\1\\\\m\"/" > commands.vim
cat dom.txt  | sed  "s/\(^.*$\)/syn keyword axDomain \1/" > domains.vim
cat pack.txt | sed  "s/\(^.*$\)/syn keyword axPackages \1/"  > packages.vim
cat op.txt   | sed "s/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/" | sed  "s/\(^[a-zA-Z].*$\)/syn keyword axOperation \1/" | sed  "s/\(^[^s].*$\)/syn match axOperation \"\\\\V\1\\\\m\"/" > operations.vim

(in fact, this is the content of the little script I added today)

Please note that I also added com.txt which is the output of
)what command

The \V tells the vim regexp engine to take any character literally, 
except for the backslash. The \m reset to vim standard meaning.
The \m is  necessary only in case there is a trailing \
This doesn't happen in com.txt but it does in op.txt
The other three files contain only keywords character, so we don't need 
regexp (ie, syn match), which is better.

That's a funny and useless error message. ;-) But why does it say "spad"?

Well. Try the direct call to AXIOMsys as I've showed you in my last
mail. You probably must set the AXIOM variable right.

Tim,

I extracted  input files from the pamphlet you indicated as examples: I 
must say that the syntax seems to look fine.

I only have to add two common abbreviations for commands which, clearly, 
can't be extracted:
)sys
)abbrev

I just have two questions:

1) Are curly brackets ever used in axiom syntax? 
It seems to me they are not and they have no meaning in axiom: if it is 
so, I can remove them from sanity check, simplifying things.

2) If I give the command (for example)
)tangle bookvol10.2
then the result is an empty input file. If I change all chunk arguments to * via
cat bookvol10.3.pamphlet | sed "s/\\\\begin{chunk}.*$/\\\\begin{chunk}{\*}/" > book.pamphlet
then
)tangle book
returns the whole input file.
What am I missing?

Wooow! It works:

export AXIOM="/usr/lib/axiom-20120301/"
./keywords.sh $AXIOM/bin/AXIOMsys

produces everything.

I have to combine this with the sed lines I posted before and then I think 
it will work.

Thanks a lot.

Fabio,

I don't believe they have any meaning.

>then the result is an empty input file. 

The tangle command is optimized for files in src/input by default.
It defaults to a chunk name of "*", meaning the default chunk name.
To use a file such as algaggr.input.pamphlet in src/input, do

axiom -nox
)tangle algaggr
  (creates algaggr.input from algaggr.input.pamphlet)

)read algaggr
  (runs the algaggr.input file and exits because of the )lisp (bye) )

axiom -nox
)regress algaggr
  (reads algaggr.output and looks for failing test cases)


The ')tangle' command line is implemented by the tangle function
(see books/tangle.lisp)




For more complex files such as books/bookvol10.3.pamphlet you can 
extract particular named chunks. For instance, if you want to extract

the test cases for domain "Any":
)lisp (tangle "bookvol10.3.pamphlet" "Any.input" "Any.output")

the help file for domain "Any":
)lisp (tangle "bookvol10.3.pamphlet" "Any.help" "Any.help")

the spad source for domain "Any":
)lisp (tangle "bookvol10.3.pamphlet" "domain ANY Any" "Any.spad")

In general, the arguments are 
)lisp (tangle "the filename" "the chunk name" "the output file")

There is no reason why the )tangle command isn't more complex 
except that I haven't had a use case for it yet.




Also, the tangle function in books/tangle.lisp is not specific to
Axiom. It can be used in any literate programming context.

I'd encourage you to consider writing your vim file as a literate
program since you're the one who understands it best. Other people
will have to reverse engineer it to understand it.

Ralf, I got it work.

Please check if it works also for you.

I had to separate axiom commands and axiom operations because the output, 
in these cases, has a different layout. Moreover, with the while+for cycle 
there was some little trouble, so I changed it to "pure sed" (and one per 
line: a little bit more verbose but more clear)

Ok, I will remove them from the "sanity check"

I see. My doubt was originated from the fact that last week I wrote a 
small pamphlet for a package (eea.input.pamphlet) and

)tangle eea

didn't produced any output. This was because I gave a name to every chunck, 
always the same but not "*": I thought that )tangle would have extracted 
the chunks regardless of the name.
I realized that this was the problem and I corrected it, so I got the

I must say that I like it very much the new format where pamphlet are pure 
latex: this is very natural when writing math.
The previous format was somewhat more clumsy.

Well, I think that a vim syntax file is something which is not going to be 
developed: once it works, it is very unlikely that it will be modified, if 
ever.
In any case, I exensively commented both the vim file and the script that 
I just submitted: producing it in a literate way I don't think I could add 
more.

Fabio,

Note that if you search for category, domain, and package names
using the Axiom interpreter it will not show all of the names.
For instance, AlgebraicFunction is "hidden" (see the variable
$globalExposureGroupAlist on line 24164 of books/bookvol5.pamphlet).

Directly grepping the books will show all of them.

The previous format used noweb which has many features, none of which
are used in Axiom. I've been slowly eliminating noweb as I rewrite Axiom.

One of the steps was to create a latex chunk environment (the latex code
for the chunk environment is commented in the file books/tangle.lisp)
Once that exists, which is the only really useful feature, everything
else is pure latex. That eliminates the "weave" (noweave) step completely.

Tim,

I checked differencies. Results are:

- categories are exactly the same
- for packages, the Axiom interpeter misses exactly
   EFULS
   EFUPXS
- for domains, the file extracted from the book is strictly contained in
   the file obtained by the interpeter: the extra packages are _exactly_
   those ending in "-" or in "&"

You can check yourself: copy in an empty directory
bookvol10.2.pamphlet  bookvol10.3.pamphlet  bookvol10.4.pamphlet 
bookvol10.5.pamphlet
and the two attached scripts, then
./keywords.sh axiom
for i in *.pamphlet ; do ./extract-keywords.sh $i ; done

By the way, I point out that I found what seems to me a typo in
bookvol10.3.pamphlet:  line 45520 looks
)abbrev domain FORTRAN FortranProgra\\

and my guess is that it should be
)abbrev domain FORTRAN FortranProgram

Regards

Fabio

OK, that's probably fine, I'll check later.

Meanwhile, I've only removed redundant spaces and remove "-nosman" after
AXIOMsys. That is ignored in this place anyway.

Please let's further develop via github. I don't like so much sending
files around.

It would also be nice, if you can incorporate the code from Johannes
Grabmeier (http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AxiomInVim).

Becuase I changed syntax rules of matching: for elements which are made up 
only of keywords (that is, character in 48-57,_,a-z,A-Z,&,!,?   ) then I 
declare something like

syn keyword axCategory Domain

Before it was

syn match axCategory "\<Domain\>"

keywords select only whole words: the markers \< \> are required in 
matches if you want the same behaviour.

With the above definitions, both rules hilights Domain but not 
EuclideanDomain.
If the match were

syn match axCategory "Domain" then in EuclideanDomain you would get Domain 
highlighted.

Another difference is that keywords have the highest priority.

Given the above, whenever possible I switched to "syn keyword"

The match syntax is still necessary just for a bunch of operations which 
are made up of simbols.

ok, I subscribed to github, even if I don't think there is a lot to 
develop: on my side it works just fine and I don't have more to say on it.

I don't think it is a good idea:
- keywords are defined as a different set (I tried to keep it minimal): 
this reuires some care in merging syntax definitions.
- using the two differente files, axiom highlights result just in a 
different color scheme: every vim user will change the color scheme to its 
own taste.
- there are a lot of other syntax that are not relative to axiom (C++, 
maybe?) It doesn't seem to me a good idea to mix up syntax for different 
languages in the same file. Moreover, they are far too complex for me.

I've now added that file as fricas.vim to the repository.

Right. I don't understand the vim-syntax, but it seems that all the
things that start like cSomething (c-prefix) are not relevant for Axiom.

Johannes, do you think you can help in merging Fabio's and your
vim-mode. Maybe your vim-mode could at least take advantage of the
generated identifiers
(https://github.com/hemmecke/vim-panaxiom/blob/master/axiom/keywords.sh).

Ralf,

I added the last changes I made.
In particular, I changed colors definition so that it is modular and it 
can be very easy for the user to customize them, or even use an already 
existing color scheme (see the readme).

About merging the two files, I am not able to see a way of doing it.
If someone does, it is surely better to have just one package for axiom 
support in vim: I will modify mine if there are suggestions.

Otherwise, I am satisfied with the version I have and I will post it on 
vim.org as the definitive (up to the next one... ) version.

Fabio

These were originally listed as packages but are actually domains.
This was correced in Axiom.

I was going to make

When trying to tangle it to get back .el, use tangle.lisp with sbcl, get
the bug:

first char in line 128 should be ; instead of :

sbcl also complains about si::getenv. Then I find out that tangle.lisp

tangle is GCL only? I suppose so since si::getenv is GCL.
I will fix that to be portable.

Maybe you should also take a look into

https://github.com/hemmecke/fricas-svn/tree/master/contrib/emacs

I believe that http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AxiomEmacsMode is
quite old and perhaps out of date.

Yes, after I commented those blocks, sbcl still gives no output, no error.

Thank you, fricas.el is very nice. Save a lot trouble.

I am combining https://bitbucket.org/pdo/axiom-environment/
and AxiomEmacsMode/fricas.el, because both have very good features:
- AxiomEmacsMode/fricas.el provide "axiom-yank/fricas-yank", can save
  a pile to a temp file and ')read' it back automatically.
- axiom-environment offers a very nice help system, and a spad-mode
  which I can write programs in one buffer while execute part of it in the
  other buffer -- I think it's a work flow even better that REPL.

axiom-environment doesn't support pile at all(which is very very
inconvenient),
that's why I'm trying to combine them together.

Hi,

Oh, fine... I'd really appreciate an improvement of fricas.el.

Where is your github repo?

Anyway, you have probably seen keywords.sh.
https://github.com/hemmecke/vim-panaxiom/tree/master/axiom

I'm sure that could be used in the build-process of any of the panaxioms
in order to generated the identifiers for tab-completion/highlighting
and whatever.

Since I'm much more interested in emacs-mode, I'd be very happy if
someone having time and expertise to take a look at it and improve it.

Ralf

axiom-environment keeps a list of axiom symbols,
https://bitbucket.org/pdo/axiom-environment/src/3d58f5ff7412cb519bbfb70f3cc0711931e216e9/data/?at=default
and the author updates it a few times, but there is no documentation
about how to do it.

In ${FRICASROOT}/algebra/*.daase, these files seem like database.
Only in fricas these files contain lots of ascii instead of lots of numbers.

https://github.com/ustcscgy/axiom-environment/tree/fricas.el

I implement  fricas.el's "fricas-yank" functionality into

Subject: Re: bug in books/tangle.lisp

books/tangle.lisp has some support code for automating axiom-specific
tasks. This support code is GCL specific as Axiom lives on GCL.

This has been fixed with read-time conditionals.
The books/tangle code is now useful in any common lisp.

If you're interested I also have tangle written in C which is
useful for doing literate programs in a non-lisp environment.
One version is available at

http://daly.axiom-developer.org/tangle.c

First I need to mention the fact that Axiom refers to the Axiom
project, not to the FriCAS project. Please don't confuse these 
two as they are distinct projects.

The daase files are databases. "daase" is a contraction of "database"
due to length restrictions of filenames in one of the many intermediate
porting platforms.

They are random access files, indexed by byte address. There is a C 
program in src/etc/asq.c.pamphlet which is a literate program that 
explains the details of the daase file format. It can be used to
"ask" (asq) for information from daase files.

The original KAF (keyed access file) format is from LispVM.

Actually I do this all the time. All you need to do is C-x 2 to split
the screen, M-x shell to open a shell buffer, start Axiom, and write a
trivial macro to "clip the expression, yank it into the shell, and press
enter". I have developed hundreds of files this way (see src/input or
src/axiom-website/CATS for examples).

Note that Axiom does not support "pile mode" in the input. You would
need to have trailing underscores on the input or write the expression
to a .input file and )read it.

Exactly for that a (slightly) rewritten keyword.sh could be used for. It
should be run at build-time of one of the pan-axiom systems to generate
the respective *-standar-*-info.el files.

Note that the result would usually differ slightly for
Axiom/OpenAxiom/FriCAS.

I've never used that. In fact, I mostly use fricas.el for running
efricas. I'm not much in favour of pile mode. Although imperfect, I
currently use my aldor.el
(https://portal.risc.jku.at/Members/hemmecke/aldor/emacs) for editing
SPAD file, but I'd rather like that SPAD syntax would be simply replaced
by Aldor syntax.

As you can certainly see, aldor.el is just a hack to make myself happy.
I'm not an elisp programmer after all.

Look in file axiom-build-utils.el, where you'll find emacs-lisp  
functions to extract package, domain, category and operation names  
from a running Axiom/FriCAS/OpenAxiom session.  The function axiom- 
make-standard-info-files at the bottom of the file can be used to  
update all the symbol files.

I'm happy to consider patches for improved functionality.  I haven't  
really touched the code for a few months, so maybe it's time I got  
back into it again!

So is this your main motivation, to evaluate fragments of files  
interactively?  If so, looks useful!

Tim,

Yes it does look interesting. Looking at the webpage it seems to go 
beyond static latex to html5 translation, to something interactive, a 
bit hyperdoc like.

If only it could link to spad code instead of (or in addition to) 
javascript that would be really powerful.

Ralf, could you please just check if the script works for you as expected?

Since I didn't make any other correction to the syntax files, I am 
thinking to submit this version at vim.org as "final" (whatever this could

Tim,
I uploaded the latest version and I don't think I will modify it again, 
unless some error is pointed out or some nice improvement is made or 
suggested.
Inside there are two script:
one (created by Ralf and modified by myself) which extracts keywords from 
axiom output (categories, domains, packages, operations and axiom commands)
and one (by me) which extracts keywords from pamphlet files (but just for 
categories, domains and packages).

If you think in can be of any interest, you can include it wherever you 
want.

Regards

The file is in the zips subdirectory. To use it type:
cp zips/axiom.vim.tgz ~/.vim/syntax

cd ~
   (edit .vimrc) and add the lines

Hi All,

I've just pushed an update to axiom-environment that adds a function

process.  As such it works with piled code.  By default it is bound to
