Subject: New procedure to download Axiom source code anonymously

Hello,

After Savannah compromise, you should now use CVS through SSH to
download Axiom source code anonymously. Here is the new procedure:


    * export CVS_RSH="ssh"

    * cvs -z3 -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/axiom co axiom 


The SSHv2 public key fingerprints for the machine hosting the cvs trees are:

RSA: 1024 80:5a:b0:0c:ec:93:66:29:49:7e:04:2b:fd:ba:2c:d5
DSA: 1024 4d:c8:dc:9a:99:96:ae:cc:ce:d3:2b:b0:a3:a4:95:a5


After first download, you can type usual 'cvs -z6 update' to update your
local source tree.


If you are a Savannah developer, please be sure that you have Protocol 2
for all savannah related hosts in your .ssh/config file.


Let us know of any issues,

PS: I have updated the web page accordingly but I don't know when
changes will take effect.

Greetings!  OK, I've got something now that works like this for GCL.

sym        completes to       external syms current package + used packages
pk:sym     completes to       external syms of pk + used packages

pk::sym    completes to       internal symbols of pk + used packages

I'll probably commit shortly.  But it would be great if we could
extend a bit to get useful behavior under maxima et.al.  The maxima
functions appear to correspond to internal symbols in the maxima
package with a $ prepended.  Perhaps we could have a user definable
function to translate back and forth from user input text to text to
be matched against lisp symbols.  We also need to figure out what to
do regarding character case.

Suggestions for maxima/acl2/axiom appreciated.

Subject: organization

Thanks for the pointers on matriods.

My current thinking runs as follows:

For each domain contruct an "index card" that contains various fields
(the index card is the structural equivalent of a "concept"). Given a
set of these index cards each field has at least one default ordering
and a default search mechanism. 

The data for the fields in the index card can be constructed by 
automated programs, for example, the compiler.

An example of an index card might contain the fields of "the general
domain structure". A general domain structure looks something like:

Foo(Join(args with sigs)): Cat with sigs == Join(dom(args with sigs))
  with sigs
  add functions

and the compiler can create an "index card" with the following fields:

 domainName: Foo
 arglist   : Join(args with sigs)
 category  : Cat with sigs
 extends   : Join(dom(args with sigs))
 with      : sigs
 add       : functions

Of course each of the parts contains subparts (the individual list of
functions) and references to other index cards (Cat with sigs), etc.
So in general there is a lot of implied structure given on each index
card.

Having created this pile of index cards we can look at the implied
structures and other interesting organizations.

Now if we look at a given FIELD in the set of index cards we can create
a program which connects the cards together. So we could classify
the cards into many networks, at least one per field. For instance, 
we could create the inheritance lattice based on the way that one 
domain uses another. 

There can be many kinds of index cards created by many kinds of parsers
(e.g. an index card that parses a pamphlet file into component parts
like title, list of chunk names, list of section names, etc). 

The general picture emerges of a very rich set of objects (the various
index cards) that are classified into dozens of different relationships. 
You can construct predicates that walk many different paths to answer a
question. For example, find the function that will be called to
multiply a matrix of complex numbers by a vector of polynomials over
the integers and tell me what file contains it. We could compute the
coercion from one domain to another per Nicolas's thesis.

This approach breaks the problem into three parts, 
writing parsers to automatically construct the index cards, 
constructing the relations, 
constructing the queries.

(The generalization which I'm exploring but not explaining is that the
index card itself is just another network. The whole thing eventually
dissolves into a very large, structured network but it's too complex
to explain that way).

I'm essentially constructing the index cards for the algebra (by hand
at the moment) to experiement with this idea. I'll post the reduced
form of these once I've completed the first pass.

Dear David!

	the idea with the matroid was a far reaching one, not assumed to
be practical at the very moment. I can however explain what in my mind is
behind this idea.

* In the 30ies (if I am right) Hassler Whithney started to think about
dependency of mathematical terms. Think of:
-  Linear dependence. This needs a module and a ring the module is build
  over.  A dependency is a *linear* relation between elements of the the
  module. This is the dependency attached to linear algebra. Its too
  weak to describe more sublte dependencies.
- Algebraic dependence. Think of a cyclic group (or modulo arithmetik)
  where relations like x^n=1 emerge. No scalars involved here. Similar
  problems occurer in Hilberts syzygie theory, where one has an
  *algebra of dependencies*.
Whitney set out to distill from these type of problems the core of the
term *dependent* and coined for that the matriod definition.

* A most perplexing feature of matroids is that they are *cryptomorphic*.
That is, matriods can be defined in quite different terms and there are
proofs that these definitions are equivalent. Eg. matroids can be defined
on graphs or on linear spaces. It shows up, that theorems easyly proved
inthe graph picture might be quite hard theorems in the linear space
picture and vice versa. This is nicely explained in a book by Peter
Laeuchli, ETH Zurich (can`t remember the title, something like
introduction to matroids for computer scientists)
	Hence there is only the abstract notion of matroid and various
*presentations* which might be more or less useful.` in a given context.

* If you are familira with incidence geometries, you may address a matriod
as a generalization of such a geometry. This is the point where I think
matroids could help to handle the algebra depencency problem.

Let us think of the following setting. We have atributes, totally ordered
by complexity (say most complex is the code itself, and least complex is a
user help page describing usage or even just examples). We may consider
this complexity as a sort of dimension or *grading* and attach to each
such concept a sort of hypervolume. Code is one dimesnional, examples are
high dimesnional.
	A dependency of two objects may then be described via an inclusion
operation (incidence relation). If a piece of code belongs to a domain,
category or user example, then there is a dependency. One might even think
of computing the dimension of the common part to give a measure how
dependent two concepts are.
	This type of dependency is nonlinear in general.



I am not yet sure how, but expect the following to be possible: Matriod
techniques should help to formalize and handle dependency relations in
such a high dimensional object. (its not only a graph, since you have not
only edges and vertices, but also volumes, hypervolumes etc.)
	Helpful in this quest is the exchange property of matroids. Every
matroid has a set of bases, say B={b_1,b_2,...} where b_i are bases. You
might select two bases, say b_1 and b_2 and wish to delete one basis
element from b_1, say x, then there is always one element z in b_2 such
that b_1\x \/ {z}  (\/ means union here) is again a basis. Such algorithms
can be used to modify dependencies into a wishful way.

What would be needed to implement such a matroid based nonsense. The hard
thing is that one would have to describe somehow all possible dependencies
(alternatively all independent sets) of the whole set under consideration
(might be derivable from Tims index charts). Then it should be possible to
ask questions like
  what ring has attribute X do not use "has commutative"
to retrieve information about the category ring having attribute X but
eliminate (if possible) the depencency on the attribut "has commutative"

To be frank, I cannot implement such a thing in software!

WARNING:
* There are matroids which cannot be described as vectorsapce matroid
* Matroids which can be described by vectors, might need a quite peculiar
  ring of scalars, say Z_2 or even more awkward

hope this explains my thinking a little bit,

Effectively, the call-back gets a char * pointer to the word of text
being entered, and a 'state' integer indicating whether the call-back
has been called with this pointer before (and if so how many times).
The user supplied 'generator' routine is supposed to return the next
partially matching word of acceptable input, and NULL in the case of
no remaining matches.  We may be able to alternately configure things
to give the call-back the whole line of text, together with start and

You should use following syntax:

(1) -> fac n == if n = 0 then 1 else n * fac(n-1)
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> fac 1
   Compiling function fac with type Integer -> Integer 
   Compiling function fac as a recurrence relation.

   (2)  1
                                                        Type: PositiveInteger
(3) -> fac 10

   (3)  3628800

In your above definition (fac:= x+-> if x=0 then 1 else fac(x-1)), I
think you define a _variable_ that _contains an _anonymous_
function. Apparently this function is unknown to Axiom when it looks for
the recursive call.

How would you define the structure of each card? Using Common Lisp data
type? Specifically defined data types? With a Card Definition Language?
Using standardized tools as W3C RDF or OWL? Using ACL2 common lisp
subset?

Building new structures _dynamically_ is important there. I would like
to build a structure, examining it and find it misses something, build a
new one and finally save it as a card because I find it interesting.

How would you store the cards? On disk? As Common Lisp data structure?
On a web server?

I would add:

 define a common repository for card structures (with attached semantics
 for each field, or reference to other card structures)

I would be interested to write index cards starting from the source
file.

For example, considering the simplest card:

Source file : file-name-type
Subsystem   : choice-in(boot database spad-compiler spad-interpreter ???)
Explanation : english-text

source file	              subsystem	explanation
-----------	              --------- -----------
src/boot/Makefile.pamphlet	boot	building of the boot parser sub-system
src/boot/boothdr.lisp.pamphlet	boot	header for boottran lisp package
src/boot/bootload.lisp.pamphlet	boot	loading of various lisp files constituing the boot subsystem
src/boot/btincl2.boot.pamphlet	boot	parsing of included lines in boot sources
src/boot/btpile2.boot.pamphlet	boot	handling of piles (source indentation) in boot
src/boot/btscan2.boot.pamphlet	boot	parsing of boot syntax
src/boot/ccl-bootsys.lsp.pamphlet	boot	loading of several lisp files constituing the boot subsystem
src/boot/ccl-depsys.lsp.pamphlet	boot	lisp file used to build depsys on top of CCL
src/boot/exports.lisp.pamphlet	boot	set of lisp symbols exported by the boottran package
src/boot/npextras.lisp.pamphlet	boot	definition in lisp of various boot variables and elementary functions
src/boot/ptyout.boot.pamphlet	boot	set of lisp functions to translate boot into common lisp
src/boot/tyextra.boot.pamphlet	boot	?? Handling of boot data structures ??
src/boot/typars.boot.pamphlet	boot	?? Handling of boot syntax ??
src/boot/typrops.boot.pamphlet	boot	Parsing of boot keywords (tokens?)
src/boot/tytree1.boot.pamphlet	boot	transformation of boot into common lisp
src/doc/msgs/co-eng.msgs	database	list of error messages
src/doc/msgs/s2-us.msgs	database	list of Axiom error messages

After that, I would like to dig into each file and build new cards, for
example describing the internal structure of s2-us.msgs. I would like to
build cards indexing each boot or lisp function, using internal
information from the compiler.

Now, two last but probably most traitorous questions:

 - do you thing we could be quickly a tool to navigate in cards? I think
   a computerized tool is of most importance to attack Axiom
   complexity. I can imaging throwing some common lisp data structure
   and functions, however it might become rapidly unusable. Have you any
   idea of a (free software) tool that we might reused?

 - don't you think attacking this issue now could delay too much the
   release of a _stable_ Axiom (with a documentation, which is probably
   the most lacking currently)? What about people that have submited bug
   reports?


In short, I like your approach and I'm eager to apply it (however not on
the algebra ;-). However, I fear it would delay more important tasks.

The symbol naming convention is more complicated than that.
You can see the function names in the .lsp files

The name is a combination of several things including some
type-related mangling and a unique number within the datatype.

We do have functions that can return information about the type

I haven't found any reference on the web to a book by
Peter Laeuchli about matroids. But I do know of some
lecture notes entitled:

  Combinatorics for Computer Scientists
  by Dany Breslauer and Devdatt P. Dubhashi. 

see

  http://www.brics.dk/LS/95/4/BRICS-LS-95-4.ps.gz

in

  http://www.brics.dk/LS/95/Abs/BRICS-LS-95-Abs/

also containing some other interesting lectures on
polymorphic type inference and category theory.

---------

Combinatorics for Computer Scientists contains useful
self-contained chapters on both graph theory and on
algorithms involving matroids. For matroids refer to
chapter 23, page 185.

>From this discuss it is quite clear, I think, how the
concept of matroid (Example 178), matroid bases and
the problem of finding a "maximal independent set of
minimum weight" (Theorem 195) relates to the issue
that Tim and I discussed much early of optimizing the
algebra "bootstrap" for building Axiom.

I think, maybe, what Bertfried is saying is that the
graph matroid that we can construct from the usual
dependency (call) graph is not the most general matroid
possible and therefore the dependency graph does not
represent all of the types of dependencies in which
we may be interested - even though it is apparently
sufficient for the bootstrap problem.

-------------

However, about all of this I remain rather sceptical.
It is not clear to me that this notion of dependency
is what is really important - at least in the context
of the algebra.

I think I would prefer a much more "structural" approach,
where perhaps more complex things (objects) are described
functorially in terms of other objects (or categories) and
operations on those objects that are simplier - often the
way things are actually defined in Axiom. Or by embedding
them into something more, or equally, complex but more well
understood by the reader - i.e. an example.

I think there needs to be some way for the user to
"navigate" over such functorial maps, maintaining on the
computer screen (or at least quickly retrievable) a summary
of the immediately relavant mappings as an aid to memory.

To the extent that Axiom is built in an "object oriented"
manner, this functorial approach should be extendable to
other parts of the system system - perhaps down to the
lisp level.

A better name for this function might be 'constant'.  'c +-> x +-> c'
should be a function that takes an argument, 'c', and returns a function
that takes an argument 'x', ignores x, and returns c.  That is, (cons 3)
is a constant function that always returns 3.

Alternatively, you can think of 'cons' as a function that takes two
arguments, one after the other, and returns the first.

Another way to see the bug is by looking at, say,

  c +-> x +-> c+x

otherwise known as addition.  You'll see the same behaviour.

I'm quite worried by this bug, since it shows some really elementary
failure of lexical scoping, which I understood Axiom to have.  I'll
investigate as soon as I have a chance.

Ok, that's what I guessed but I wasn't sure.

You can try:
(1) -> cons c == x +-> c

However, I'm not sure if it is really a bug or a bad bahavior of Axiom
type inference system. For example, is 'c' or 'x' interpreted as a
function variable or as a polynomial variable?

You might want to try first to precise the type of arguments and
returned type when defining cons function.

If you have access to Axiom book, chapter 6 would be a must read.

Subject: Variable scope (was Questions)

I did some further investigation in my intended type of variable binding 
and found out, that it does work in Maple and Haskell, but not in Axiom 
and Lisp. My function 'cons' was ment to produce a
constant function. Here is the example produced with Maple:

MAPLE
-----

> cons:= c -> (x-> c);
>

                          cons := c -> x -> c

[ This is the constant function 6, where Axiom produced x -> G1234
> cons (6);

                                 x -> 6

[ A linear function could be created in the same way
> lin:= m -> (x-> m*x);
>

                          lin := m -> x -> m x

[ And with slope two
> lin(2);

                                x -> 2 x

[ This one is tricky, but Maple can add functions. Support for this
feature is primitive, since the result is not simplified to x-> 2x + 3
> f:=cons(3)+lin(2);

                       f := (x -> 3) + (x -> 2 x)

[ And, to prove it is a function:
> f(2);
>

                                   7

This plain example might seem useless, but refers to one of the
fundamential programing techniques in functional languages.


HASKELL
-------

Here is the same example in Haskell:
cons :: a -> (a -> a)
cons c = \x -> c

cons 3 2 does evaluate to 3.


LISP
----

Emacs-Lisp deals differently with this situation:
(defun constant (c) (lambda (x) (c)))

(constant 3)
;; (lambda (x) (c))

(apply (constant 3) '(2))
;; Symbol's function definition is void: c


AXIOM
-----

The Lisp evaluation is just equivalent to what Axiom does. It transforms 
a->b->a into a->b->#1. I do wonder where comes the unbound variable 
from, where there is initially none?


In my eyes the Maple binding does make more sense, but there is 
certainly no bug in either algebra system. I am still curious if there 
is a workaround in Axiom.

Sam,

Axiom should build and install on SuSE. A GUI is not necessary
at the moment because Axiom only does text output. You can use
TeXmacs as a front end if you want a GUI interface as it will
format the equations better.

The windows port is in process. Windows is a particularly hard

Subject: [crystal] A proposed framework and associated tool: LIS (Logical Information Systems)

Hello Axiom developers and users,

Tim has expressed the desire to have an Information System that allows
to explore and modify Axiom internals. He called that the Crystal. This
has raised some discussions on the Axiom developer list recently
(http://mail.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-12/msg00075.html).

I think I have found a *possible* approach to solve issues raised by
Tim. It is called LIS (Logical Information Systems,
http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/). This is a research made at IRISA, Rennes,
France, by Olivier RIDOUX et al. They propose a formal framework,
algorithms and tools (i.e. running code) to classify a system, *explore*
it and *modify* this classification, always in a coherent manner.

Roughly speaking, they propose to attach (valuated) attributes to files
and explore a file hierarchy according to those attributes, by following
attribute paths like one would follow file paths. It is even possible to
lively modify the explored hierarchy (in a coherent manner!). Moreover,
the files itself can be seen has having attributes (per file line for
example). For example, a C or Lisp file could been seen as a directory
containing the set of defined functions in that file.

One of the most interesting feature of their approach is that they
proposed a regular file system interface (called LISFS) to use it. In
other words, from the beginning, the system is usable with a wide range
of existing tools (bash shell, emacs & vi, Gnome and KDE graphical file
browsers, find & grep, ...).

Another interesting approach is that one can have different taxonomy
(i.e. set of classification attributes), that can be used
simultaneously. For example, language specific attributes on C files and
system attributes (file type, file size, etc.). Through a plugin system,
one can add others attributes, to enrich the file system and exibit more
information.

Here is an example that might make the LIS more clear.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a shell session done in an emacs buffer. My comments are added
between shell commands.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  We want to explore the file through their extensions, so we go into
  the ext: directory.

/sfl/sfl1 $ cd ext:/

  We then want to explore only the C files, so we go into the ext:c directory.

 We concentrated on the foo C file (i.e. foo.c), so we go in its
 directory named foo/.

-rw-r--r--   1 pad      root          118 Jan 16 18:45 foo.c

  We can edit it if we want. foo.c appears as a regular file.

/sfl/sfl1/ext:/ext:c/name:foo $ emacs foo.c 
#<buffer foo.c>

  More interestingly, we can explore the foo.c file itself, using some
  information of the C language. So we code in the parts/ directory of
  the foo.c file (pathname /ext:c/name:foo/).

/sfl/sfl1/ext:/ext:c/name:foo $ cd parts

  Doing a ls, we see the functions defined in foo.c. We have f and f2,

One could imagine to define attributes set for Pamhplet, SPAD, BOOT,
Lisp, etc.

As I said previously, LIS researchers have running code (under GNU GPL
license, written in Obbective Caml), although not yet released to the
public. 

If you want to know more on LIS, they have a full range of papers on
there web site (http://www.irisa.fr/LIS/). The USENIX 2003 paper is
probably the most closed to what I have shown.


So, now, what about LIS and Axiom? I am personnaly convinced that LIS is
a viable approach to solve Tim issues. I'll try in the mid term to make
a first demonstrator, focused on the algebra and the exploration of the
type hierarchy. From that demonstrator, I hope to convince Axiom
developer that the LIS approach is indeed interesting.

If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask me.

Ok, you want (1) to show the type hierarchy using type/subtypes
relationship.

Can you elaborate more on that. Do you want to search all operators
having the type Ring as argument? Would you like to search for a
specific operator? According to which criteria? a type of function? An
input or ouput type? Operator name?

Could you give me a concrete example, i.e. with real Axiom types and
operators, of what you would like to do in a perfect world. 

It might even be possible to realize a system that proposes the most
general type doing a computation. But I need a more concrete example to

A commented example of Axiom computation with usage example of the

Subject: [axiom journal] Mizar Project and Journal of Formalized Mathematics

Hello,

Regarding the Axiom Journal, a friend told me about the Mizar project
(http://mizar.org/):

  The Mizar project started about 1973 with an attempt to reconstruct
  mathematical vernacular.

  Since 1989, the most important activity in the Mizar project, apart
  from continual improvement of the Mizar System, is the development of
  a data base for mathematics. International cooperation (the main
  partners: Shinshu University in Nagano and University of Alberta in
  Edmonton) resulted in creating a data base which includes more than 2
  thousands of definitions of mathematical concepts and more than 30
  thousands of theorems.


One interesting point about the project is that they have a journal
(http://mizar.org/JFM/) which seems similar to what Tim wanted for his
Axiom Journal, i.e. with machine readable description of paper content
(http://mizar.org/language/pages/mizar-article.html).

It might be of some interest to look at it before crafting the specs of
the Axiom Journal.

David,

Mizar looks like an interesting idea. Carlo Traverso is working
on a literate programming journal. I'll pass the reference on to
him. 

This also fits a second goal, the CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite).

Good work. Thanks.

My name is Tim Daly. I'm the lead developer on the Axiom project.

Axiom is a free, open source, general purpose computer algebra system
similar to Mathematica and Maple. It was originally developed at IBM
Research starting in 1973. It was later sold to NAG (Numerical Algorithms
Group). Axiom was a commercial product until 2001 when it was withdrawn
from the market and released as free software under the Modified BSD license.
The current home page is:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom

Axiom consists of many hundreds of algorithms, many of which are 
implementations of research level mathematics. Many of these algorithms
cannot be understood without reading the associated research papers.
Currently the research papers are in libraries, journals, or proceedings.

We have been discussing ways of combining the research with the executable
code. Knuth has recommended a style called "literate programming" which
combines TeX files with special tags that embed the source code. This
would allow us to keep the research paper with the implementation code.
Dr Carlo Traverso is looking at developing a specialized journal in
computational mathematics that would accept articles written as literate
programs.

As computers begin to have a larger impact on mathemtatics there will
be a subset of mathematics, which I call computational mathematics,
which can only be performed by computer. We need to develop formal
ways of handling the mathematics and its associated computational
aspects. In particular, we need to develop machinery (similar to
your Mizar syntax) that allows the computer to access and manipulate
the mathematics as well as the algorithms.

I've been looking at your Journal of Formalized Mathematics. It appears
that we have areas where our goals overlap. For instance, in the paper
"Introduction to Turing Machines" there is a description of turing machines
which can easily be reduced to executable code. I notice, however, that
it does not include the code. Traverso's Journal would extend the article
with such code.

If you have any interest in considering cooperative efforts (such as
extending the Mizar syntax to allow executable code) please let me know.

Dacian,

I know that Axiom has OpenMath support. NAG, especially Mike Dewar,
was deeply involved in this effort. I'm unfamiliar with the details
of OpenMath so I don't how much help I can be.

The best place to get help is to send email to list
This is the Axiom mailing list. Some of the developers know more about it
than I do.

Do you have CVS? You can get the code from the website by typing:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/projects/axiom login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/projects/axiom co axiom

The first command will log you in as an anonymous user. It will 
prompt you for a password. Just hit enter.

The second command will create a new directory called axiom in
your current directory. If you current directory is

/home/dacian

you would type:

cd axiom
export AXIOM=/home/dacian/axiom/mnt/linux
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
make

Let me know if you have any problems.

==================================================================

Dear Sir,

I am doing some project research that is involving AXIOM and I am writing to
ask for your help in this matter. 

One of the goals of the project is to make use of AXIOM and provide an
interface to it based on OpenMath. I'd like to know if there is built in
support for OpenMath in AXIOM 2.3 and if you could help me getting AXIOM
application. I noticed that the internet download section is still down for
several weeks and I have no possibility to get the code from somewhere else.

It is very important for me that AXIOM should have OpenMath support. It
would be nice if AXIOM could accept OpenMath input and return OpenMath
output as well. Please let me know if there is such release and if not what
other solutions there are for this problem.

I am looking forward to receiving your answer.

The procedure to download the Axiom sources from CVS has changed after
savannah crack. Dacian, you should do:

export CVS_RSH="ssh"         ## depending on your shell, in this case for bash
cvs -z3 -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/axiom co axiom

The SSHv2 public key fingerprints for the machine hosting the cvs trees are:

RSA: 1024 80:5a:b0:0c:ec:93:66:29:49:7e:04:2b:fd:ba:2c:d5
DSA: 1024 4d:c8:dc:9a:99:96:ae:cc:ce:d3:2b:b0:a3:a4:95:a5


Of course, you should have ssh available on your machine.

The remaining procedure of Tim to compile Axiom is correct.

Let us know of any issues.



Regarding OpenMath, I'm afraid but I think all NAG work to support
OpenMath is no longer available in current free Axiom. However, Bill
Page, Camm Maguire (lead developer of Gnu Common Lisp) and of course
Mike Dewar where also interested by OpenMath and they might help
you. They are on this list.

Greetings!  This looks very interesting!  Just thought I'd also
mention another related though less sophisticated approach from the C
world -- cxref.  Basically, it is a hook into the compiler which
captures the variable, function, call tree, and comment structure of
the source and outputs to latex/html/.... Whether the output is in
this form or in a browseable filesystem (very neat), it might be
logical for the lisp compiler to parse and cross reference this
information from the input source, rather like GCL already does to
some extent with the .fn files.  Time permitting, I'd be interested in
extending GCL to process source files in this manner.

Actually this would not be the focus of the project and I believe that you
will do a better job than me. From what you are telling, you will implement
OpenMath support for AXIOM (the same version available from cvs I hope).
When do you thing it will be ready ?

Will there be a built in support for OpenMath ? '(e.g input - a file
containing OpenMath and output the result also in OpenMah).

Dacian

I'd like your permission (and assistance if you can) in converting
your paper to working code within Axiom. In particular this would
involve modifying the TeX document into a "pamphlet" file which is
Axiom's literate programming format (It is basically TeX with two
additional tags that allow program source to be extracted).

Is it possible to get a TeX version of your paper and permission
to modify it to include it as part of Axiom?

While I've not used Doxygen extensively, I know at least its
capabilities. Doxygen is good to document C++ code, draw class diagram
and add documentation to pieces of code, however it is very very far
from Tim's ideas of multiple exploration axes for the Crystal. That's
why tim's ideas are so interesting. :)

I've been looking at the classification scheme of finitely presented

the axioms which define each group. Any help would be appreciated.
I'd like to state the axioms that are added at each point in the

The "finitely presented simple group (+WP)" is hanging out unclassified.

Where do nilpotent groups of order 2 fit?

There are a list of groups that need classification. From a discussion

Sam,

"Building Axiom" requires no skill (that's why I could do it :-) ).
Essentially you download the sources, type make, and wait for a
really long time. At the end of the make you should have a running Axiom.
I don't have a SuSE binary available as I don't have a running SuSE.
My compile farm is currently hosed and awaiting my time and attention.

I'll look at your review website as soon as I get a chance.

Tope looks interesting. I'll see if I can find a windows box to

that hang on the end of an expression such as:

Perhaps Tope would be useful here.

What's a free nilpotent group?  It sounds more special than a nilpotent
group, so I'm confused by your hierarchy.

This seems like a list of properties of groups, rather than
constructions of groups, so 'free' doesn't seem to quite belong.  But
maybe it does, since subgroups of free groups are automatically free.
But then why don't you have free abelian on this list?

Amalgamated and HNN groups are both best understood as special cases of
graphs of groups.  It would be nice to do the general case and unify
these two.

Aren't small cancellation groups necessarily automatic?

By the way, I object to putting finitely presented groups at the base of
the hierarchy (if I understand the diagram correctly).  There
interesting groups which are not finitely presented, which you can still
work with in practice.  Maybe it has a countable set of relations, or
maybe it's a subgroup of a finitely presented group, or maybe it's
infinitely generated.

Two infinitely generated groups that I know well is the infinite
derangement group (with only a finite number of objects displaced) and
the infinite braid group (likewise).  Both have solvable word problem
and (I think) conjugacy problem.  (The word problem, at least, is
quadratic time for the braid group.)

Several of the properties you list (like automatic) do specifically
refer to finitely presented groups, but others (like nilpotent) do not.

I think I must be misunderstanding something.  Please help clear up my
confusion!

What is GWP?  The others must relate to solvability of

free nilpotent groups of order 2 are special groups that we study 
locally. I expect that you'll find the hierarchy confusing as I'm
confused by it myself. I'm trying to sort out the various infinite
group classifications into some sort of a category hierarchy so I
can properly encode them in Axiom. It appears that this hasn't been
done before.

Ideally I'd like some sort of a Venn diagram showing the containment
and overlap of the groups, their axioms and their properties.

(In fact, I once saw such a detailed Venn diagram for groups, rings, 
fields, etc in a book but have not been able to lay hands on
it again. If you happen to see it please give me the reference.)

I've been struggling with the properties vs axioms of the groups.
I'm trolling the literature to construct the tree of axioms associated
with the various groups.

Do you have a reference I could look at? I'm unfamiliar with the
more general case but I'm willing to learn.

I don't know yet. I haven't seen a theorem to that effect.

Magnus (my other computer algebra project) specializes in finitely
presented groups. Thus finitely presented groups represent a base
assumption for the kinds of groups I want to classify. I want to
enable Axiom to perform the computations currently done by Magnus.
To do that properly I need to figure out a category hierarchy.

I don't have any machinery to handle infinitely generated groups.
Once I get the category classification straight I need to organize
the algorithms in Magnus (and Sim's book "Computation with Finitely
Presented Groups" Cambridge Univ. Press 1994) into the hierarchy.
I don't have any algorithms on infinitely generated groups.

Ah, braid groups. I missed that one. In fact, there is another 
hierarchy on my list of semi-random lattice diagrams namely one in 
topology (where braid groups are used in knots).

No, the misunderstanding is mine. As I said, this apparently hasn't
been done before so I'm trying to derive the category hierarchy.
What appears to be confusion on your part is a lack of understanding
on my part.

Indeed the two diagrams are describing two different kinds of 
classification. The second diagram looks at what kinds of problems
are known to be solvable (+), unsolvable (-), or unknown (?).

Dylan,

If you can find a copy of 
Steen, Lynn Arthur and Seebach, J. Arthur "Counterexamples in Topology"
Springer-Verlag (1978) or Dover (1995) see page 16. The diagram given
there for topology is essentially what I'm trying to achieve for the
group theory work. (It is an astonishing diagram and I don't hope to
achieve nearly so complete an understanding.) I'd also like a similar
diagram describing rings, unique factorization domains, etc for algebra.
This kind of exposition would put our understanding of the fundamentals
of Axiom on a solid footing.

I need to achieve this kind of understanding (or some shadow of it) in
order to properly add categories to Axiom and to construct the crystal.

Subject: group theory ordering
Cc: Gilbert Baumslag

Chuck,

Thanks for the notes. I realize that there are several different ways
to order the lattice of group based on different metrics. I have an
example from topology (which I hope to keyboard later today). It comes
from an excellent book called "Counterexamples in Topology" by Steen
and Seebach (Springer-Verlag, 1978; Dover 1995) on page 16. They
order the groups based on axioms. They also have order diagrams 
based on properties such as connectedness and compactness which are
entirely different. I'm trying to derive similar information for our
area and it appears nobody has done so yet. As Dylan Thurston pointed
out I still have several points of confusion.

One point of confusion appears to be that some terms are defined as
as axioms and some are defined as properties. Sometimes I see writers
use abelian as an axiom and sometimes I see it used as a property.
I'm beginning to see that Axiom has this confusion also.

I'm looking to attack the problem of ordering these things for 3 reasons:

1) I need to understand (and classify) these groups in some systematic ways
   so I can get a better handle on the pile of results and algorithms.
2) I need to understand (and classify) these groups so I can figure out
   a category structure that Axiom can use to construct these groups and
   order the algorithms.
3) It seems like a good domain to build this beast I'm calling a "crystal".
   Picture a huge ball of string in space with many knots (the
   ball being a graph of the many relationships and the knots being
   clusters of axioms and properties related to a concept. Now "wrap" the
   knotted string with a "crystal" with many facets. Each facet extracts
   a different structural relationship of the concepts in the ball. This
   whole thing (viewer and network; aka facets and string) I call crystal.
   Some facets show the math, some the lattice, some the underlying code.

Virtually every area Axiom has touched has the same problem (though less
intense) as Infinite Group Theory. Everything is ordered by everything
else. How you want to order it depends on how you want to think about it.
I want to look at Infinite Groups ordered in many different ways.

So crystal is an attempt to let you string things together in all of the
ways you want to think about them (the ball) and view them in all of the
ways you want to see them (the facets). Hard problems within crystal are
things like automatically classifying concepts (by using a metric like
subsumption) so (a) they fit in the "appropriate" place and (b) you can
find them again. You want it to be automatic because you want the machine
to do the work. Axiom already automatically extracts a great deal of
information when it compiles things and even more when you contruct
type towers of domains. At the moment this information is exported as
"databases". The idea of a "database" is too limiting to order the kind
of math we need to play with. Semantic networks are closer but, like the
ball itself, they aren't the only way to build the structure.

Of course, none of this is magic which means that I have to understand,
extract, categorize, code, compile, classify, and view the concepts.
I've done a complete reduction of Axiom's categories and domains and
I'm looking at the compiler output to see what I can automatically
extract.

I'll look at the information on your website.

Since you have this 30 year horizon for Axiom, would it make sense to

This may be combined with the test-suite, but is much more general. I am not

self-repair is hot news these days. IBM calls it "autonomic computing"
because they make an analogy to the human autonomic nervous system which

system tries to return to a known state when disturbed. For example,
your windows box will tend to a blue screen (the normal state) :-)

I'll have to look at what texhash does. I know there is another lurking

The case sensitive issue was addressed by Juergen Weiss a few months ago.
I've been remiss in adding it for no obvious reason. Anyway it's been
applied, tested, and added to the CVS (thanks, Juergen). . So now Axiom's 
pathnames should not be case sensitive.

     If you are you need to turn off exec-shield first.

2) Did you just update from last night?

Must confess I've never used it, but understand that although it has
some nice features, there can be nasty strings attached.  I've seen
reports of the bitkeeper folk revoking certain individuals' 'license'
to use their software, and also understand that it is forbidden, for
example, to use bitkeeper to develop an alternate source revision
control system.  My impression is that it is quite restricted, and can
lead to trouble down the road.

I've heard of a number of other truly open alternatives, though have
not tried any (e.g. aegis?, subversion?).  Would be interested in
reading a knowledgeable comparison.

re: yanking licenses. they are quite sensitive to people trying to 
develop clones of bitkeeper since they actually sell it. however the
only requirement for using the free version is that you host your
meta-information on their site (not your code). they use the meta

As Camm, I would be quite reluctant at using bitkeeper, as it is not
free software.

Tim, have you considered GNU Arch
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/)?  It is very similar to
bitkeeper in spirit. It has a big developer community (well maintained?)
and, more importantly, it keeps modifications as change sets. It is also
free software.

Regarding your particular request, it works without central
repository. It allows developers to pull source tree from other
developers' source trees[1].

I've heard of very positive feedback from one of TeXmacs developer
(David Allouche) who uses it for daily work (no pun intented).

well, piffle. the CVS version is broken as I failed to upload a 
change to one Makefile.pamphlet. I'll do that once I get home.

That isn't Peter's problem, however.

I don't see any reason for the build to fail at that point.

lisp appears to have been built successfully.

bootsys appears to have been built successfully. (bootsys is an 
interpreted image that is used to compile the src/boot files).

now the system is building depsys. this involves compiling the
files in src/boot. the first file you try to compile fails.
this means that bootsys is broken somehow. try the following
and let me know the result:

Each developer has a copy of the repository with his own additions. He
can make parts of it public (probably through a web server).

But do not take this for granted. I've not read yet the Arch doc. :)

Subject: gnu-arch

If it works anything like bitkeeper (and it appears to do just that)
then it works as follows:

I create a tree (or several trees) locally. You can ask to "pull" a
copy of my tree. Now my tree is the parent and yours is the child.
You can make changes locally and send me "changesets". A changeset
is just a collection of patches, hopefully with a common goal. This
solves the problem of changing multiple files in sync (so you don't
make the mistake I just made last night and forget a file change).

You can pull the latest parent tree and it gets automatically merged
with your local changes.

The main advantage is that I can create several trees and share them.
Right now the only shared resource is the savannah CVS and I have to
be very careful what I put up there because I can (and do) break the
build.

Local trees mean that we can create sub-projects to explore ideas (which
is how I work locally, albeit by hand) without breaking the build for
the world. For instance, I want to work on the automatic coercion 
code from Nicolas's PhD thesis which will deeply break the world for
a while. So all you would normally see is silence from me while I 
get it working. It would be better if you could see and change the
latest broken code without waiting for CVS.

So hopefully gnu-arch will give us the ability to share experimental
trees.

3. This is for Camm Maguire. Can you please give me some hints on

The failure of the build is due to the fact that latex is not installed.

yes, it is possible to connect to Axiom but it requires a bit of 
low level knowledge to do it. Axiom adds a socket package to GCL
and you can access the Lisp code directly.

For details see src/lib/sockio.c.pamphlet line 1264
and you can see that Axiom adds code to GCL to do things like
redirect standard I/O

This code is used by src/interp/sockio.lisp.pamphlet (around line 93).
So it is possible to use sockets from lisp.

It is even possible to use sockets directly from the spad algebra
language. Function calls to lisp functions (e.g. car) can be reached by
CAR(x)$LISP
that is, the function name must be uppercased and $LISP appended.

I'm afraid I don't know what a 'phrasebook' is in this context.  Once
I write the common lisp bindings in GCL to the (C) openmath library,
doesn't axiom already know about that api?

Greetings!  Just a quick note here -- all should work below as Tim
says, but if anyone would like to use GCL's native socket support
instead/in addition and could provide a quick example of a socket
session to be so converted, I could take a look at it (at some point
in the moderately near future :-)).

Take care,

Subject: Possible switch from CVS to GNU Arch

Hello,

For demexp development, I'm seriously considering switching from CVS to
GNU Arch (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/).

Pros:
 - excellent support for renaming, handling of patchset, etc.
 - excellent support for branches
 - support of non-centralized trees
 - apparently well maintained

Cons:
 - not available as debian package in woody (isa impacted, however it
   can be compiled from sources)
 - no windows port (windows port of demexp)
 - not tested yet (I've just read the docs ;)


In any case, if I switch to Arch, I won't force other demexp developers
to also switch to Arch. I'll update the CVS tree on a regular basis. We
should also do regular snaposhots of the development tree. 

Any opinion ? Any news ?

Subject: Re: Possible switch from CVS to GNU Arch

Well, the big news seems to be that you switched email addresses.
Or somebody is posing as you.

No news yet. Gnu-arch compiled cleanly. I put it on several machines
and it installed without a problem. I'm slowly reading the docs and
trying each of the commands. I have an archive up on one machine
which I'm populating at the moment. 

Opinion? Well, CVS works to keep things archived, it is standard on
savannah so I'm stuck with it there. However it forces a single
point-of-development model and requires me to do detailed bookkeeping.
I've already hosed the master site twice by failing to upload a changed
file. Hopefully Gnu-arch will cure two of the three problems. I'll still
have to export to CVS for savannah but Camm should be able to make
changes in the gnu-arch tree for GCL-native socket support and send it
in as one "changeset" (fixing single-point-of-development). And it
should cure the missing file issue since everything gets bundled as a
changeset (fixing the missing file upload issue).

Further, I have a few "parallel" projects with various people (for
example I want to explore the coerce code with Nicolas) so I want
separate trees with experimental code without breaking the master tree.
Gnu-arch appears to have a better merge model.

So I'm on the learning curve at the moment. Linus uses bitkeeper for
Linux because he faced the same issues so if it works for him it should
work for me. But, as you point out, bitkeeper has a non-free license
and, if free works, why bother?

Subject: gnu-arch

I have several efforts on Axiom in process at the same time.
None of these efforts can show up in the savannah tree because
they break the build for our normal "customers".

We need a development tool so we can work on new ideas and allow
them to proceed in parallel. To that end I've been investigating 
Gnu-arch. Gnu-arch allows you to "pull" a copy of a particular
subproject, work on it locally, and submit a "changeset" which
is a series of patches collected into one.

I've succeeded in setting up the main project. I'm still working
on the details of how to create subversions of this project. You
can get Gnu-arch and play with it if you like. The latest build 
I have is tla-1.1.tar.gz from the gnu-arch website. You can get
up to speed by the following steps:

(download tla-1.1.tar.gz)
tar -zcf tla-1.1.tar.gz
cd tla-1.1/src
mkdir =build
cd =build
../configure --prefix /usr/local
make
make install

tla my-id "Your Name <you@place>"
tla register-archive axiom@tenkan.org--axiom-SOURCE http://axiom.tenkan.org/current
tla make-archive --mirror-from axiom@tenkan.org--axiom-SOURCE you@place--axiom
tla archive-mirror axiom@tenkan.org--axiom
tla my-default-archive axiom@tenkan.org--axiom
tla get axiom--release--1 axiom
cd axiom

Notes:

tla is the only executable. All commands are parameters to tla.

tla my-id has a standard format "Your Name <you@place>"

tla register-archive says that the name "axiom@tenkan.org--axiom-SOURCE"
    should resolve to "http://axiom.tenkan.org/current" which is where
    the current version of Axiom resides (for developers). The current
    stable customer version will be on savannah.

tla make-archive says that when you ask for "axiom@tenkan.org--axiom"
    you want it copy the Gnu-arch project tree to "you@place--axiom"

tla archive-mirror does a network copy from "axiom@tenkan.org--axiom" to 
    "you@place--axiom"

tla my-default-archive "axiom@tenkan.org--axiom" says that all commands
    are assumed to refer to this archive by default.

tla get reaches into "axiom--release--1" (which is hiding in 
    "you@place--axiom" in gnu-arch form) and expands it into the
    directory "axiom".

cd axiom will get you to where the source resides.

As for further details, well, I'm still reading the docs.
If you're interested in tracking one of the various subprojects
you might want to try this example.

Let me know if you succeed or fail.

done. By the way, "you@place--axiom" is the name of the local directory
where the archive is stored so I prefer to use a directory name like
"~/pub/axiom-libre/Tim-axiom-archive".

> tla archive-mirror axiom@tenkan.org--axiom

Be aware, it takes some time without any indication from tla. The base
file is about 27 Mbytes.

Not done. I don't want to do that (I'm working with my own default
archive) so...

... I have done:

tla get -A axiom@tenkan.org--axiom axiom--release--1 axiom

And I have the sources. Great! :)



I also need to reread the Arch tutorial:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/tutorial/arch.html


By the way, there is a tool called cscvs to transform CVS history into a
proper Arch history. It takes a long time but it works. I've used it on
another project. 
  http://wiki.sourcecontrol.net/moin.cgi/cscvs


BTW, a question, is your axiom--release--1 tree the latest CVS tree?
Looking at the CHANGELOG, it seems so, but just to be sure. I also
noticed that most of files have executable rights (like
src/Makefile.pamphlet). I think it is not needed.

Do not forget to use the -S option when doing the totla
command. Otherwise the Summary lines of tla logs are not very
meaningful (you would have patchset-84, patchset-85, ...).

Hi David!  Will I be able to reproduce this with latest cvs?  I'm

mail address.  Another BTW, just released a new axiom Debian package,
0.20040128-1, which built without a hitch for me and should eventually
make its way across all the other Debian platforms when the
autobuilders take hold.   This build used Debian's externally
installed gcl, 2.6.1-23, but I can't think of any changes since axiom
took a snapshot of the 2.6.1 tree which would explain this.
