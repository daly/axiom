Any progress? The wiki is still shown in google search results, but unfortunately its pages are not cashed. I just wanted to know if there is really no parametric polymorphism in Spad.

Hi Grigory,

I am also looking forward to these pages being up again, or just have
the text content somewhere.

The another good reference you can probably find is in Martin Baker's site:

Hi Alfredo,

> the text content somewhere.

Well, I was trying to put them up, but the computer that I have 
available for this virtual machine does not allow me to run 64bit VMs, 
because the processor is not powerful enough. In other words, I 
currently have no machine.

Anyway, I (of course) also want to see the information back online. 
However, the axiom wiki runs on a very old ubuntu and the Plone 
installation is also very old. I'm not very eager to leave it that way, 
But upgrading might not even work.

In fact, I'm currently thinking about two things.

1) Put the static stuff to github and manage the pages via sphinx 
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ .

2) Make the IPython notebook understand %%fricas as a cell magic and 
provide a server that enables people to run some code.

-----

1) would probably be a task to go though all the pages and move them 
into restructured text. Not the easiest task, but certainly doable.
We would be using "git push" to update the website on github. We 
wouldn't have any need to provide a server ourselves and the pages would 
be versioned. Of course, that wouldn't be a wiki, but I don't see much 
of an advantage in a wiki.

2) Involves understanding the IPython magic. I'm not at all very 
knowledgable in Python, but to me it looks as if it shouldn't be too 
hard to get something like Bill Page did for the sage notebook and 
Martin Rubey did with efricas inside the IPython notebook.

Would you be able to help with (2)?

Anybody else any ideas?

Ralf

Greetings, and thanks for your work here as always!

Is the tar file posted yet?

There is a really nice blas/lapack/atlas shared library FFI in gcl I can
discuss with you if interested.

Take care,

Parametric types available in Spad are more powerful than
parametric polymorphism in core ML, in particular you can
almost mechanically translate such code to Spad.

What Spad lacks is type reconstruction and general recursive
types (single recursion is doable by using %).

	pages?

Ralf,

Axiom wiki does not depend on Plone although it can be used from
Plone.  Axiom wiki was in fact built on another Zope product called
ZWiki.

When you say "static stuff" I wonder if you do not fully appreciate
how a wiki operates.  The "static stuff" is normally not what gets
presented to a user unless they are actually editing the content of a
page. The content is represented in one of several markup formats and
in the case of Axiom-Wiki it also includes embedded LaTeX and Axiom
commands.  When a user clicks Save after editing the content a
"rendered" version of the content is generated and usually also
involves running Axiom (Axiom, FriCAS or OpenAxiom) to convert Axiom
commands and output to embedded LaTeX before converting the embedded
LaTeX to jpeg images.  In a sense the rendered version of the wiki
page is also "static" - so long as it is never edited again.  An awful
lot of the rendered content is in the form of these images.

Anyway it is possible in principle to "harvest" the rendered form
using something like wget.  The result is a css stylesheet for
formating and a bunch of HTML code for each wiki page that includes a
lot of <img> tags plus whole lot (maybe as many as 10,000 or so) of
image files.  I did this once several years ago to produce a CDrom
version of the site.  Everything was OK provided you never clicked on
a function like "edit".  But I think maintaining and updating a static
site like this would be close to impossible.

---

Personally I don't see the point of

> 2) Make the IPython notebook understand %%fricas as a cell magic and provide
> a server that enables people to run some code.

since the Sage notebook interface to FriCAS already exists.  And in
any case it would not be in any sense a replacement for the wiki.

Bill Page.

Camm,

The actual implementation details, the fortran code, the lisp code,
and the spad code are all contained in book volume 10.5 (numerics).
You can find the PDF on the documentation section of the website
or on the Wikipedia Axiom page.

Greetings, and thanks!

BTW, the Debian axiom package automatically polls

http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

for new releases (in case I miss an email list post), as

http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads/  

is not searchable.  So if you remember to update the former when making
a release, I'll be sure to see it and package updates can proceed more
smoothly.

You're probably already familiar with the legacy FFI using defentry, as
I think axiom uses this already.  This is a bit slow, but functional.

I've designed a new one with the goal of accessing shared libraries from
within GCL given its unique (it appears) ability to unexec a running
image, and reexec later, possibly on a different machine.  A shared
library link therefore needs to be remembered in the image, together
with all code pointer locations which must be reset on image startup.
The following is implemented in the 2.7.0 tree, but can be backported
rather easily if you need it.

There is a :lib package:

(do-external-symbols (s :lib) (print s))

LIB:|libm| 
LIB:|libc| 

each external symbol of which tracks a live shared library binding, and
which also names another package with the dynamically linked symbols in
use:

COMPILER>(do-external-symbols (s 'lib:|libm|) (print s))

|libm|:|atan| 
|libm|:|ctan| 
|libm|:|csqrt| 
|libm|:|clogf|

|libm|:|cexp| 
|libm|:|acos| 
|libm|:|sqrt| 
|libm|:|ccos| 

Each of these symbols name genuine lisp functions which wrap calls to
the external routine in question:

(function-lambda-expression #'|libm|:|atan| )

(LAMBDA (#:G550) (DECLARE (OPTIMIZE (SAFETY 2)))
        (CHECK-TYPE #:G550 (LONG-FLOAT * *))

               (LIT :DOUBLE "(" "(double(*)(double))" "(" "dlatan"
                    "))(" (:DOUBLE #:G550) "" ")")))
NIL
|libm|:|atan|


These functions check argument types, but when inlined at (default)
safety 0, simply compile to calls to the routine through a C pointer.

New bindings are made via the defdlfun macro:

(defdlfun (:double "cblas_ddot" "libcblas.so") :int :double* :int :double* :int)

|libcblas|:|cblas_ddot|

(do-external-symbols (s :lib) (print s))

LIB:|libcblas| 
LIB:|libm| 
LIB:|libc| 
NIL

(do-external-symbols (s :|libcblas|) (print s))

|libcblas|:|cblas_ddot| 
NIL


The usage exactly follows C prototype rules.   

One limitation at present is that the function cannot be run when
interpreted, i.e. must be compiled.  I'll try to find time to fix this:

(compile '|libcblas|:|cblas_ddot| )

;; Compiling /tmp/gazonk_21018_0.lsp.
;; End of Pass 1.  
;; End of Pass 2.  
;; OPTIMIZE levels: Safety=0 (No runtime error checking), Space=0, Speed=3, (Debug quality ignored)

start address -T 0xb66b50 ;; Finished loading /tmp/gazonk_21018_0.o
#<function 01cf2090>
NIL
NIL

The function can now be used as any other function:

(setq a (make-array 10 :element-type 'long-float :static t
:initial-contents '(1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0)))

#(1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0)

(|libcblas|:|cblas_ddot| 10 a 1 a 1)

385.0

When the image is saved and restarted, the linking pointer is
automatically updated.

On Debian based systems, such blas calls automatically proceed to
optimized atlas calls (when installed) making use of specialized vector
instruction extensions.

One thing that should be kept in mind when using blas/lapack/atlas is
that the latter can call malloc under certain circumstances.  I wish
these libraries had some means to toggle allocation on the stack, but
they don't, or at least didn't last time I looked.  This means that if
you pass arrays allocated in relocatable memory, the result could be
corrupted if a gc is triggered.  We wrote gmp wrappers to handle a
similar situation.  But for a generic interface, this is impossible, so
arrays should be allocated in contiguous block memory to be safe,
i.e. using the :static t keywords in make-array.  It is somewhat of a
pity, as such memory is slower to GC.


If you have any questions, please feel free.


Take care,

Camm,

I just updated the download.html file.
I was waiting until I had compiled the binaries for the different distros.
I did not realize you were monitoring that file.
I'll update it immediately next release.

Tim
