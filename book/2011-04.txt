Just picking a nit here:

"operator over" replaced by "operate over" in the only instance it occurs.

Sigh. I will have to build a fedora14 box and do a
clean build there. Apparently there is an imcompatible
change to the ELF format (a very surprising thing).

Looks like a 64-bit system trying to exec a 32-bit binary?  If so, perhaps
check for the glibc.i686 package and install if needed?

Subject: Need install help

On my Fedora 14 platform, I have successfully:
yum install xterm emacs git-core patch texlive texlive-latex m4
yum install libXt-devel libXpm-devel gcc xorg-x11-proto-devel
--all installed, some already up to date

downloaded axiom-fedora-jan2011-bin.tgz and unzipped the tarball into 
/home/donald/axiom.
cd axiom
export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/fedora10
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
[donald@localhost ~]$ axiom
bash: axiom: command not found...

The file structure under /axiom appears to my untutored eye to be 
complete. I can walk down the file structure in Firefox 
(file:///axiom/mnt/fedora/axbook and DISPLAY but not execute the 
javascript text. I can *visualize* the text using Chrome. I've obviously 
missed (or mangled) an important step.  Can someone nudge me in the 
right direction?  TIA,

I have built a fedora 14 box, compiled axiom, and
uploaded the binary. Try:

wget
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads/axiom-fedora-mar2011-bin.tgz
tar -zxf axiom-fedora-mar2011-bin.tgz
cd axiom
export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/fedora
