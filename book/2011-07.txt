Axiom does not use OpenMath.
You can remove the library.

Subject: Axiom July 2011 release

July 2011 Release

The prior release had a bug that caused it to remember the build location.
This was a change introduced by the underlying lisp. This was fixed.

This release continues treeshaking the compiler. 
The modemap.lisp file has been merged and no longer exists.

This release continues to treeshake the interpreter. 
The axext_l.lisp file has been removed.

Makefile.pamphlet
  add BUILD=full / BUILD=fast switch

Book Volume 5 (Interpreter)
  treeshake interpreter

Book Volume 9 (Compiler)
  treeshake compiler

Book Volume 10.3 (Domains)
  help and unit tests for RewriteRule

axiom.sty
  add /refsdollar and /defsdollar for better cross references

src/interp/Makefile
  add (si::reset-sys-paths) per Camm
  remove axext_l aldor support file
  remove modemap.lisp

Subject: odd looping behavior

Camm,

I am seeing some odd behavior in loops.

If I write

(let (result)
  (setq a 
    (do ((x somelist (cdr x)) (result nil))
        ((atom x) (reverse result))
      (setq result (cons (fn x) result)))))

or, in a simple form as
(let (result)
  (setq a
   (dolist (x somelist (nreverse result))
     (setq result (cons (fn x) result)))))

I do not get the same behavior as
(setq a 
 (prog ()
  (return
   (do ((x somelist (cdr x)) (result nil))
       ((atom x) (reverse result))
    (setq result (cons (fn x) result))))))

That is, if the result is scoped outside of the
setq and used in a loop then I appear to get 
different results than if it has prog scope locally.

The failure is stable no matter what I do to the
inner loop. I have tried it using the loop macro.
Nothing seems to change the result.

Unfortunately the failure is deep within the build
process of Axiom and hard to isolate. I am trying to
get a test case.

The version I am using is at:
http://github.com/daly/axiom/blob/master/zips/gcl-2.6.8pre4.tgz

Tim
