Hello,

For your information, I have updated the screenshot page on Axiom web
site (modification will be effective in 6 hours from the date of this
email). 

http://www.nongnu.org/axiom/screenshots.html

The global page size should be reduced and it shows more capabilities of
both Axiom and TeXmacs.

BTW, I'm not a mathematician. If you have short examples of mathematical
computations made with Axiom that show Axiom capabilities, especially
compared to the other Ms (Mathematica, Maple, ...), I would be pleased
to add them to the screenshot page. A textual output is prefered for
bandwidth issues.

Yours,
d.

Greetings!  On the problem architectures only, I tried simply doing a

( mkdir -p /build/buildd/axiom-0.0.0cvs/mnt/linux/algebra && cp debian/*aase mnt/linux/algebra/ )

before the main make, and the system still tried to rebuild the
databases, failing due to too many open files.  Is there some step
inside the 'make' which will erase the contents of the
mnt/linux/algebra directory before proceeding?

Take care,

Hi,

just to thank you for your help.

-- AXIOM didn't compile on my work computer, as David Mentre suggested due
to a wrong translation of UPPERCASE filenames /net/CliDisk/... ->
/net/clidisk/...

-- AXIOM compiled sucessfully on my home computer (SuSE 8.0, AMD XP1800
(however the compiler did not notice the CPU)) and seems to be fully
functional. (At least it did what I tried in a correct way)

./configure is helpfull, but why not actually setting these variables

make works

make install didn't work (as root) for the following reasons

localhost:/home/fauser/axiom # make install
78 installing Axiom in /usr/local/axiom
cat: /home/fauser/axiom/src/etc/axiomcmd: No such file or directory
make: *** [install] Error 1

may be the directory is missing or wrongly addressed?

thanks for your help again, I can now start to play with the system
:-)))) and will try to in stall TeXmax also.
BF.

David,

I just did something very stupid ...

While thinking that I should "clean up" the old versions
of tm_axiom that were in the axiom_texmacs directory in
the Files section of Savannah, I checked that I had all
the files I wanted in my upload/axiom/axiom_texmacs
directory and then did

  rsync -z -v --rsh=ssh --recursive --delete .
billpage1@savannah.nongnu.org:/upload/axiom

And the damned thing did exactly what I told it to do -
deleted everything but my new axiom_texmacs directory!
So it is real clean now! In fact everything else is gone.

Is there a chance that you may have done this the right
way and copied everything to your system first? If so,
could you please replace what I deleted?

So sorry.

Bill Page.

David, Tim;

Well, no need to panic, I guess... but jeez' I hate it when this
happens.

I do have everything (I think) on another computer. Unfortunately
I wont be back in front of that machine until Tuesday. If we can't
find everything before then, I can restore it then. But I did find
the tutorial, so that is back now. And both the old and new versions
of tm_axiom are there.

David, thanks also for your work on tm_axiom. I have just finished
re-compiling Axiom from the current CVS and I installed and tested
your new version of tm_axiom. It works greate. I especially like
the Makefile. The installation instructions are a bit arduous,
althought quite clear. Perhaps we need a "make install" option?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I do have everything (I think) on another computer. Unfortunately
I wont be back in front of that machine until Tuesday. If we can't
find everything before then, I can restore it then. But I did find
the tutorial, so that is back now. And both the old and new versions
of tm_axiom are there.

David, thanks also for your work on tm_axiom. I have just finished
re-compiling Axiom from the current CVS and I installed and tested
your new version of tm_axiom. It works greate. I especially like
the Makefile. The installation instructions are a bit arduous,
althought quite clear. Perhaps we need a "make install" option?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I have part of the upload directory there. I'll tried to restore the
content. But I think it is a good opportunity to update the content,
with more recent releases of source and binary releases. :)

BTW, a savannah-hacker told me that he had changed access rights on
directories. So it might be easier to upload now. But I'm not sure the
bug is fixed.

In fact, the axiom/ directory (including the Makefile) is a direct copy
of TeXmacs' plugins/axiom/ directory. In the mid term, I hope this work
will integrate TeXmacs, it should be there.

Yours,
d.

This is due to an old script for Axiom/TeXmacs interface in TeXmacs
source tree (or I suspect so as you haven't given to me the version of
your TeXmacs).

You should use the latest script found on:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=axiom   (in Axiom_texmacs
                                                 section) 

Use version:

 - 1.0.2: for TeXmacs up to 1.0.2 (included)

 - 1.0.3-texmacs1.0.2.4: starting from texmacs-1.0.2.4 and Axiom CVS
   2003-10-31.

It is a bit messy right now but we hope that TeXmacs and Axiom will
synchronize in the short future.

Yours,
d.

I'm currently uploading the content of the axiom/ directory. With my
poor 128Kbit/s line, it will take some time.

I have deleted old cvs releases and added a new CVS snapshot, in both
source and binary (debian 3.0/i386) form. The uploaded release is
cvs-2003-10-31 (with the new AXIOMsys binary).

In the source package (axiom-src-cvs-2003-10-31.tar.gz), I have deleted
gcl-2.5.2.tgz, OMC*.tgz and advi* to reduce the archive size. 

Bill, I have given access right "chmod -R g+wX" on all the axiom/
directory in download section. I hope it will help to allow us to upload
files of another project member in the future.

Yours,
d.

Ok Bill, the upload is done. The content should be correct now.

I had some issues with some files you uploaded:
mkstemp Axiom_Tutorial.pkg/1.0.0/.README.txt.V2L4n7 failed: Permission denied
mkstemp Axiom_Tutorial.pkg/1.0.0/.tutorial.pdf.q3PVmg failed: Permission denied
mkstemp Axiom_Tutorial.pkg/1.0.0/.tutorial.tgz.a5SRpp failed: Permission denied

mkstemp axiom_texmacs.pkg/1.0.3-texmacs1.0.2.4/.axiom_tm-1.0.3.tar.gz.ZZLwSI failed: Permission denied

You should give them access rights "chmod g+rw" and re-upload them. I
_think_ it will fix our previous access rights issues.

Yours,
d.

Hello,

Here is a patch against TeXmacs 1.0.2.4 axiom plugin that includes:

 - support of both free and NAG versions of Axiom (only tested on the
   free Axiom, I have not access to the NAG version)

 - inclusion of a line-breaking algorithm

 - modification on prompt handling to interact correctly with Axiom

Please notice that this patch will work only with releases of Axiom
starting from current CVS tree. Older Axiom (like those found
precompiled on Axiom web site) won't work.

Most of the work of this patch comes from Bill Page.

Let me know of any issue with this patch.

Yours,

+* Author: Robert S. Sutor

+* Date: 1991
+*
+* Change History:
+*
+* 09/01/92 RSS Format and fix =-.
+* 09/29/03 WSP Incorporated linebreaker into tm_axiom
+*              Replace \root{n} \of {x} with \sqrt[n]{x}
+*
+* Operation:
+*
+* The expressions in display math mode are broken so that they fit
+* on a page better (line breaking).
+*
+* The array stuff is being converted to use the array node type.
+*
+* Restrictions:
+*
+* 1. This is meant to deal with output from the AXIOM computer algebra system.
+* Unpredictable results may occur if used with hand-generated TeX code or
+* TeX code generated by other programs.

David,

Ok, thanks for updating and restoring everything. I have modified
the permissions and re-uploaded the axiom_texmacs.pkg and
Axiom_Tutorial.pkg. I hope that solves our mutual updating
problems. Give it another try and let me know. (I'll try inserting
something into one of your directories a bit later - I am a
little shy of touching this at the moment... <grin>)

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I'll look into the issue. I might have to include some special
mechanism for your case as you want behavior that isn't correct
in general.

Tim,

This might sound like a stupid suggestion, but ...

Why not include all the files from autoload directly
into the interp saved image? That should reduce the
number of loads required and should not affect the
behaviour of AXIOM any other platform. No?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill,

The autoload files fall into 3 categories: compiler code which is only
needed for developers, hypertex code which is only needed for documenation,
and NAG library code, which is unused at the moment.

The only reason you see this code loading a lot is that we are using
most of these facilities during the build. In actual use the code
rarely gets loaded.

In fact, though, the whole loading issue is due to history. It used to
be the case that Axiom needed to run in under a meg of memory so autoloading
was vital. It still is an issue because I'm trying to get it to run on a
Zaurus. But, in general, there is no reason why we couldn't load all of
the code AND the algebra into a single image and run it without the whole
algebra subdirectory and the databases (databases queries are cached after 
the first read).

Tim

Hello,

The page describing Axiom on TeXmacs web site has been updated:
  http://texmacs.org/tmweb/plugins/cas.en.html#axiom

Let me know if you see something wrong on this page. I have write access
to the web site.

Excuse me, but where should I put this correction? I don't see "correct
typ" in neither TeXmacs and Axiom web pages.

Hi,

congratulations for your wonderful work! I'm very much looking forward to 
using axiom as my favorite CAS in the future!

Unfortunately, I do not have access to the axiom book, so I hope that a
version will be online soon. I'm especially interested in programming in
the axiom language, I suppose I can use the aldor docs for that? Other
than that, I also like lisp very much, but I suppose for axiom it's better
to stick to spad?

One question right away: how can I tell axiom that it should assume x>0,
for example. Playing around, I also discovered a bug, I reported it
already. By the way, I think that the bug form is wonderful! (the maxima
project has already the problem, that bugs are not very much classified)

The bug comes from playing around with the examples given in 
http://www.math.unm.edu/~wester/cas/Paper.ps

Maybe a little background: I do Combinatorics, with side interests in 
Algebra and Graph Theory, currently at the LaBRI in Bordeaux.

Martin

I'll remove the --enable-readline from the lisp configure.

Clef needs to be updated slightly. It was written before readline I believe.
It should follow the readline conventions of using Ctrl-N, Ctrl-P, etc
in addition to the arrow keys. At the time those conventions didn't exist
(even though we were all emacs users).

Hi,

I am packaging Axiom for Fedora. I created a src rpm
available at:
http://www.hotfeet.ch/~gemi/rpms/axiom-0.0-0.fdr.1.cvs20031031.src.rpm
I builds on RedHat 9, but it would be nice if
somebody could test it, before I submit.
Two aesthetic questions:
1. What files can I exclude from the package? For example
the noweb files are not needed for the running system.
2. Quite a number of text files have the executable flag set,
that should be fixed in CVS.

Regards,

Gérard,

I just downloaded the phoebe fedora CDs last night.
I'll try to do a machine build tonight.

I'll look into the executable flag issue.
Noweb files will be used in the running system in the future.

There was a yet-more-recent release mentioned but every mirror was
either overloaded or not up to date. I figure I'd download phoebe
and then upgrade later. It takes about 24 hours to build a complete
set of CDs so I don't plan to do it often. The rumor is that fedora
releases should happen every 3 months. Perhaps we can plan to 
stabilize Axiom releases in time for each fedora release. If I had
been clever I'd have set up an axiom and an axiom-beta tree on cvs.
I'm not sure I can do that now.

Tim

I tried to install the rpm on fedora (phoebe) and I get:

user gemi does not exist
group gemi does not exist 

for each file in the rpm. I'm downloading the fedora (yarrow) CDs now.
It'll take a couple days to get a complete download followed by a
system rebuild but I'll be happy to test the rpm again.

Gérard,

The axiom build from the rpm fails because it requires latex to be installed.
The default install of fedora (phoebe) does not install latex.

Gérard,

The build depends on installing the rpms (in order):

tetex-fonts-1.0.7-64.i386.rpm  (disk 3)
tetex-1.0.7-64.i386.rpm        (disk 3)
netpbm-progs-9.24-9.i386.rpm   (disk 1)
tetex-latex-1.0.7-64.i386.rpm  (disk 3)

I'll have to add a few lines to the configure script to
check that latex exists and can be executed.

Tim

Bill,

check out www.wxwindows.org

I've been looking at the windows port a bit more.
Except for the fact that it is C++ (I just spent a month
rewriting Magnus, my other computer algebra system which
is in C++) it looks like it might be useful.

re: latex

Both GCL and Axiom use latex. GCL uses it to format the GCL manual.
Axiom uses it as part of the literate programming tools.

Technically latex is not needed to install the axiom rpm since
the rpm only includes source code. So I don't think you need to
check for latex.

I have to figure out how to check for a latex install in the axiom
configure script.

Is it not so, that it is gcl that requires these?
Maybe the gcl included with the axiom distribution should
be made not to depend on them.

I build the src and i386 rpms as normal user (as it is recommended)
The binaries have the right user and group, but the src seem to
have the user and group set to the builder's.
I have downloaded the yarrow cd's and will install them tonight.
I hope all will be alright, but my experience with RH8-RH9 was
not bad.

My understanding of wxWindows is that it is mainly a library to build guis=
 
usable under various OSes (Linux, Windows and Mac). So it could be useful 
for the future, if you want to build interfaces for Axiom, or maybe to 
port Advi under multiple OSes, but I wonder if it is really useful right 
now, just to compile Axiom on Windows ?  I would say it is more like 
Tcl/Tk or Python/Tk? But I maybe wrong, it's a long time since I looked at=
 
wxWindows and discussed with Julian Smart.

So I will have to put those dependencies that you mentioned
into BuildRequires.

Michel,

I agree with you. wxwindows is a cross-platform gui
solution and there are several of these that we could
choose *if* (when?) we get involved in writing or re-
writing graphical interfaces for Axiom. (For example,
TeXmacs has this specific problem at the moment between
Linux, Windows and MacIntosh versions.)

The operative word is *if* because in many ways I think
it would be best if we could concentrate our efforts on
the mathematical algorithm and documentation side of the
effort and depend on integration of other open source
packages for the user and development interfaces. I think
this is important because for the last several years I
have argued strongly for example with the Maple developers
that they have spent way to many resources developing user
interfaces (with only moderate success at best) at the
expense of mathematical advances (which I have to admit
has still advanced somewhat in spite of the diversion of
resources). For Maplesoft, the decision of concentrate
on gui development is mostly driven by marketing
considerations. But one of the advantages of open source
development, it seems to me, is that we need not be driven
by such considerations.

The current difficulties with the Axiom port to Windows
however are not of this kind. They are actually only
relatively minor compatibility problems with the original
"extras" C code that extends GCL (such as the socket io and
file system operations). The best way to resolve this I think
is to get rid of this extra C code in favour of the
functionality that is now built to GCL. But this involves
some deeper analysis of the spad and Lisp/Boot code than
either Tim or I have had time for yet.

Regards,
Bill Page.

There is a GUI tools summary page
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/7184/guitool.html
that I found helpful when wondering what to try to use. It is very clear 
that LOTS of people find wxWindows very good but when I tried (maybe a 
year ago) I found that the versions I downloaded did not buidl all their 
demos and examples "out of the box" on either Windows or Linux and 
although with coaxing I got a lot further I got somewhat put off. This 
year's experiment I have been making is FOX (www.fox-toolkit.org) which 
(with at most a modest following breeze) has built for me on Windows (via 
MinGW32), RedHat 9.0, 64-bit Linux, Solaris and Darwin.

Greetings!  I'm just uploading now a temporary work around to see if
there are any other issues on the dlopen systems.  I just patched the
Makefile.pamphlet in src/algebra (only on these systems) to copy
prebuilt *.daase files in place of attempting a rebuild, for now.

Would be interested in knowing your progress on the Zaurus.  Axiom on
Debian ARM/Linux looked like it was building great, and then
mysteriously halted near the end, perhaps due to an autobuilder
timeout.  (The Debian autobuilders will kill a build if they don't
generate output after a certain interval.)

You can see the log at:

http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?&pkg=axiom&ver=0.0.0cvs-9&arch=arm&stamp=1067765668&file=log&as=raw

which ends with:

Camm,

re: patch. I'll look at it.

re: zaurus 5600

the 5600 isn't an ARM chip, it's an intel x-scale chip which i believe
is binary compatible with x86. i'm about to find out...

i have the terminal app installed, i've seen it do wireless network
browsing, and i'm trying to figure out how to build a .ipk file so I
can run the app installer. it looks like they might be tar.gz
files. the next step is to tar up a GCL lisp image and try to get it
on the machine.

i wish they had indented the tops of the keyboard keys so i could
hunt-and-peck with the stylus.

overall i have to rate the 5600 an A+. it's an amazing hunk of
hardware and software. took literally seconds to network.
400 Mhz, 196M memory, wireless connectivity, linux, pocketsized.
personally i'd have skipped the consumer market, gone bigtime
into the geek market, and advertised on slashdot. 

i'm hoping somebody does a wireless cpu/disk i can bolt to my
hip that depends on an 802 keyboard/display tablet. That way 
i can carry all of my data and programs around, walk up to any
pc anywhere, and be able to work instantly. splitting off the
display and keyboard from the cpu/memory/disk gives much better
form factors for both.

re: compile failure

That particular compile takes a long while to compile which might
explain the timeout. I'm rather curious what the compiler could
be doing for so long on this file. I suspect a minor rewrite will
reorder the category search and it will compile nearly instantly.
That is a task for another day.


Tim

Camm,

Another autoload factoid:

You'll notice that during the image build there are a bunch of 
domains loaded. I did an analysis of the most frequently loaded
domains (just before we shipped the system to NAG) and added code
to pre-load the top 50 or so into the saved image. This list could
be expanded.

This won't fix the database build problem but might be of interest
later.

Tim

Camm,

Did I read correctly that debian produces an ARM version of Axiom?
Or tries to? If so, please point me at the .ipk file.
That would rock hard.

Tim

Greetings!  While I'm a bit confused if your zaurus is arm or i386
from earlier email, you can get prebuilt gcl arm tarballs at:

http://people.debian.org/~camm/gcl

and following the brief instructions in HOWTO-UNPACK-DEBS.  Don't know
anything about an .ipk file, but it is likely just some packaging
format, no?  If your zaurus is arm, you should be able to untar the
build, set your paths, and build axiom as normal.  Currently, there is
no completed axiom build on Debian arm due to the timeouts, but it is
close.  I'm reasonably confident I can build it by hand, sidestepping
timeout issues, on some of the arm boxes I have access to.  Would this
be useful?  Can we simply repackage the .deb into an .ipk?

Take care,

Camm,

It appears that the x-scale processor is really the same architecture
as an arm processor. 

A .ipk file contains 3 things:
  debian
  control.tar.gz
  data.tar.gz

which appears to be the same as a .deb file. Bill's friend points out
that there are 2 similar file formats. Anyway I'm about to try gcl.
I'll let you know.

Tim

Great!  The path ahead looks quite smooth.

I'd suggest using 2.6.1-18, which will hit the main mirror site soon.
I can get you the file in the interim if you need.  -18 closed a
compiler bug which may have contributed to the timeout reported in the
axiom build.  (Basically the accumulation of data in an internal
compiler variable -- not a show stopper on all but perhaps the slower
machines.) 

I'll try a build too.  Please let me know if you have problems with
the .deb. 

Take care,

You already found it by yourself but I previsouly said that the XScale
processor is a variation of the ARM architecture. <grin>

Greetings!  Just a progress report so far -- the arm axiom build is
still compiling, as the machine has other load as well.  There was a
bug in compiling an algebra file, but I restarted the make, and it
appears to be proceeding past this point.  I'd like to see how far it
gets, and then rerun just the (minimal) failing command in a gcl-dbg
image to see what's going on.  Most likely a gcc issue on arm.

Here is the failed step:

I saw your note about x-scale and arm while copying a soon-to-fail binary. 
This ARM processor is going to cause Great Program Lossage (GPL :-) )
because I have to build a cross-compiler environment. So many technologies,
so little time...

I think I can manage to install the files by hand.
I'll look at it as soon as I can and get back to you.

Greetings!  OK, but we think that a precompiled arm binary will be
installable?  There are of course shared libraries to consider, but
should be readily available.

Take care,

Camm,

I unpacked and studied the GCL .deb file. It includes prereqs
of things like GCC so I really can't install it on my Zaurus.

You can not install gcc on the Zaurus?
Why not?

Been there, done that. However, I can't recover the pointers to the
needed scripts/binaries right now.

You'll find pre-build toolchains and instructions starting from:

 - In the debian distribution

 - http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/tools.shtml

 - http://www.aleph1.co.uk/armlinux/docs/toolchain/

 - and of course, as you are using a zaurus:
   http://docs.zaurus.com/index.php?id=linux_compiler_setup_howto 

As far as I remember, gcc >= 3.3 is the recommended release to build on
ARM architecture. However, I don't remember recommendations for libc &
binutils.

I hope it helps a little,
yours,
d.

Good morning, Joris.

You're ahead of the curve on this one. I haven't had a chance to view
the tutorial under TeXmacs yet. I'll download it today and review it.

re: tex macros

One of the things to think about is that the tutorial was written to
run in Axiom's help system called hyperdoc. Hyperdoc has several 
features that are enabled by embedded tex macros. All of these are
in the axiom style file. Using tmdoc would break things in hyperdoc.
We'll have to work out some compromise.

It will allow examples to be clicked on and executed. 

It allows "constraints" between lines. That is, if the example that is 
chosen requires previous examples then the previous examples will be
automatically run first. If you try to execute, say, a draw command
and the function defined in the draw command is defined elsewhere
you can specify in the tex macros that the definition must be run first.

It allows navigation (thus the random-looking "help", etc).

It allows embedding the live graphics image directly into the page.
Thus if you execute a draw command the image will show up in the page.
But if you click on the image it becomes a separate window on the desktop
and can execute live (e.g. rotate, scale, print, etc).

It allows "tear-off" pages. That is, you can click on a page and move
it to the desktop as a freestanding page. It would be like clicking on
a mozilla tab and opening it a new desktop window.

Almost all of this is supported by inline TeX macros.

Several new facilities are planned such as the ability to follow
citations in the text, dynamically extract, compile, load, and execute
the code in a pamphlet, dynamic "booklet" construction by adjoining
sections from pamphlets, semantic search (so you can find Abelian as
a concept, as a math definition, as code implementation in a particular
domain, or as standard text in pamphlets and booklets.

re: buggy tex/latex

If you find buggy examples of tex/latex please send them to the list.
I know of one bug due to escapes that I'm chasing on another queue.
I'm documenting how I debug it in the DevelopersNotes file so developers
can see some of the debugging tools. It is listed as an open bug.

I never use tex/latex output so I'm unlikely to see the bugs.

re: trailing ->

We could probably implement a "set prompt" command that would allow
you to set the prompt to anything (including nothing). Would that help?

re: the more general interaction of TeXmacs and Axiom

We've had many discussions about this subject as I have a near religious
belief that documentation is vital. We're not using the computer to do
anything more than a fancy typewriter at the moment. That's fine for now
but it will be positively primitive in 30 years. I've attached parts of
other discussions here just to recover them from history.

I'm not sure how far TeXmacs is willing to change to support Axiom.
Clearly most of the technology we develop over time will not be specific
to Axiom (e.g. running embedded code in a pamphlet could be Maple code).
If the machinery is done correctly then the current Axiom would just be
a plugable "engine". A lot of the ideas would be useful in TeXmacs.

Sorry, I'm off building castles in the air again. I'll stop.

======================================================================

I like your idea of "synopsys" and "algorithm" tags.  Clearly the
pamphlet files need structure.  However I'm not sure that the chunk
tags are the right place for the structure. The chunk tags are 
intended to quote and embed code in a tex document. The booklet
extension allows the code to be in files which are "included" but
still has the idea that they embed code. We're beginning to evolve
the noweb idea. David Mentre took the first step with the booklet
code.

Actually, Axiom's math evolves. Bill Sit has given me a newer version
of the PLEQN domain that includes later work. Several other people
have indicated that they also have later, improved work. I'm
struggling with the idea that Axiom should have an embedded CVS so you
can add new work while still referencing the old. And CVS solves the
problem of authors taking different directions with the same
mathematics. But I'd have to change the build structure to take this
into account so this idea is a long way off yet.

What you appear to suggest is that portions of the document might contain
tags, lists, or markers (TLM) that indicate the intended use of the
material.  The machinery for this would be easy to add. We simply need
to have a parameter on various tex tags (e.g. \section[synopsys]{The
Section}) What isn't clear, as you point out, is the meaning
associated with the TLMs. Perhaps a standard portion of the pamphlet
could exist (similar to an index) to carry this information. I have
a "concept index" for commutative algebra which I plan to use to
structure the booklet files once they come into existence.

My thoughts on the subject, clearly open to debate, are that the 
pamphlet files contain information that the author can structure
to explain a particular point. Think of these files as "technical
papers" which potentially contain code. A technical paper has a
certain assumed, but not required, structure by convention. It has
an abstract, background, new results, summary, and bibliography.
I think the pamphlet files will evolve structure by convention also.

This raw information can be used and viewed in many different ways.
My thought was that "booklet" files would be the organizers of information.
So to address your example of sophistication level I'd expect an author
to write a booklet file that includes portions of pamphlet files. Simple
booklets such as an intro to linear algebra would only include text from
the examples portions of pamphlets. Complex booklets about lie algebras
might include portions of the theory sections containing theorems. So
booklets are intended to organize the pamphlet information for a particular
purpose. Pamphlet files are for organizing raw information about the code
and its supporting mathematics. I'm not sure if this is (a) a clear division
of responsibility or (b) a workable solution to your issue. It needs more
discussion.

Knuth and Dijkstra both made this observation and both decided that
literate programming was the technique most likely to attack the issue
of documenting the code. It is ultimately up to the programmer to document.
I'm hoping, by force of convention, to convince Axiom programmers that it
is worthwhile spending 2/3 of their time documenting. The saving grace
is that, at least in mathematics, you get professional recognition for
writing up your results so you can, at minimum, attach the technical
paper to the code and call it a "pamphlet". That allows later authors to
better structure the mixture. If we succeed in keeping the theory with
the code it will be a major improvement over the current situation. Of
course, I'm not satisfied with just mixing the two. I want to exploit
the collection and make it useful for broader purposes.

When the alpha version gets uploaded look at
src/algebra/dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet. I've combined the theory with the
code. Denavit-Hartenburg Matricies (DH Matricies) are 4x4 matricies
with special structure that enable them to describe rotations,
translations, scale, perspective, and skew operations. This domain was
used to create the graphics in the glossy pages of the Axiom book.  I
wrote the original spad code essentially without comments. The theory
comes from Richard Paul's Ph.D.  thesis (which he gave me permission
to use). I'm now trying to atone for my sins and document the domain
properly. Since this code will support graphics I'm hoping to use it
as an example domain to exploit ADVI's ability to embed active graphics.

ADVI seems like worthwhile technology as they have found a mechanism
that allows authors of tex documents to embed information into the
dvi file that ADVI can use. This allows Axiom to perform all kinds of
interesting magic which opens up new ways to construct "books", booklets,
pamphlets, slides, technical papers, etc. And it uses "standard technology"
(since Knuth anticipated this in the dvi file format).

The alpha release of Axiom will use an axiom.sty file that will eventually
allow us to embed ADVI information. ADVI has shown what's possible but we
need to do much more.

=======================================================================

It is important to get the documentation available quickly but it is
more important to structure the documentation to support the system
as a whole. I'd like to see Texmacs and ADVI support pamphlet files
in their native format. So one of the delays has been that I'm trying
to understand the details of ADVI and what changes might be required
to support the literate programming style.

Please try to look "into the distance" with the documentation and
Texmacs. Once the documents get released "into the wild" there 
will be great resistance to changing it because people will build
tools (like the axiom-texmacs interface) that they will refuse to
change for "legacy" reasons. We've already seen this with the 
axiom-texmacs "prompt" issue. NAG's axiom hasn't been available for
2 years and still people won't change. 

The documentation structure is critical to the long term success of Axiom,
a point I've beaten beyond the grave. But the documentation structure has
to support things like Axiom Journal articles, "drag and drop" literate
programs (where you drag a pamphlet file onto a running Axiom and it gets
compiled, the docs get put in the right places, the required references
get fetched and loaded, etc), pamphlets can be combined into booklets, etc.

Fifteen years ago we did hyperdoc which was a browser-like technology
with hyperlinking. This was years before Mosaic was conceived and it
was very creative then but it's dead technology now. What new features
will you create when you combine Axiom and Texmacs that will look
positively insightful fifteen years from now? What features are
lacking in all of the online documentation you've already seen? How
does having the embedded code and/or the ability to have "live"
documents change the game? I'm interested in ADVI because I can have a
document page that includes moving graphics generated in real time.
When we did the hyperdoc we set it up so that you could get a page
with a draw command which, when executed, launched an embedded
graphics page. That embedded graphics was "live" and you could rotate,
scale, shade, and print it. How can we do this in Texmacs?  

What will mathematicians need from the documentation 30 years from now
and what do we need to do now to support that? Can texmacs import the
axiom type lattice and "know" about the domains? Can it dynamically
build booklet tables of contents as you visit files (so I can create a
booklet by visiting a series of pamphlets (this would allow me to keep
a structured booklet of the math I've learned from the pamhlets.
Essentially it is a personalized book)). Can it "fold" and "unfold"
code and/or documentation? Can it follow references and bibliographic
links to load code and docs? Can I construct a course outline and let
texmacs find related material in the docs (e.g. a linear algebra
course)? If you look at the linear algebra course at MIT's OCW website
ask yourself how the documentation (tests, projects, video, course
outline, textbooks, etc) can all be combined in some form of pamphlet.
Can I construct a CAD-like graphic image of a bridge and attach both
the matrix mathematics and its associated documentation to points in
the bridge image? Can I structure the documentation so that the
documentation presented to the user is adjusted to his level of
expertise (e.g. a student discussion of matricies vs a research math
discussion of matricies)? What if the notion of files goes away and
all of Axiom is just one big, coordinated document (that happens to
have execution sematics for portions of the graphics or the code).
How can I think about, navigate, modify, and maintain a terabyte sized
"document" that is Axiom? How do we integrate a semantic web into the
documentation so that the concepts are automatically classified into a
proper hierarchy (e.g. KREP, a knowledge representation system). A
KREP-style semantic web would allow a user to navigate by concepts
rather than text. KREP is 20 year old technology and we should be
using it already. The "next internet" project is looking at building a
global semantic web. What will it mean to Axiom if work you do today
is instantly classified and available worldwide tonight?

So I guess I'm asking you to be innovative with the documentation as 
it is critical to the long term success of Axiom.

=======================================================================

Axiom needs the documentation mechanism to support research in a deeper way.

When researching a concept I generally have a pile of research papers
as well as my own notes and experimental code. There are also numerous
versions of these things including versions of test cases and results.

I've looked at some "outlining tools" that could have some helpful ideas.
In particular the ability to "fold" text so you can temporarily blank
out intervening sections is quite useful. I tend to do this a lot in
emacs by splitting the buffer and having two views of the same buffer.

But that's just a simple tool. We need to think deeply about the issue
of organizing (a really bad choice of word as is "capturing", "structuring")
the work done during research.

For instance, I'm working on the Hanna-Neumann conjecture. This involves
writing and running code to check for possible counter-examples as well
as exploring the boundaries of the problem (e.g. if a counter-example
exists it must have a certain form). To do this I generally write code,
try it and examine the results (possibly making a note to myself about 
some vital insight in some ephemeral form like writing it on my hand).
Next I'll try another slight modification to the code, etc. In a better
world the file system would keep all of my versions (the Symbolics machine
filesystem used to do this) as well as the attached notes. It also involves
none-machine interaction like conversations, blackboard work, and email
discussions. My research rarely ever occurs in the office because I can't
get contiguous blocks of quiet there.

I've been muttering about the "30 year" design goal and what we how we can
innovate now to support researchers in the future. 

There is a book called "The Mind Map Book" by Tony and Barry Buzan.
They seem to have thought about this also and I need to read the book
with an eye to understanding their concept.

Greetings!  Just wanted to give a brief report on some of the latest
building and autobuilding:

1) With 2.6.1-18 and later, the ia64 problem, in which shared
   libraries at runtime had to exactly match those present at compile
   time, has been eliminated.  Just tested the latest ia64 axiom build
   against multiple versions of the same shared libs, and all is
   stable.(!)

2) I lost contact with my arm machine during the build, but it looks
   as though at most there might be problems compiling one or two
   algebra files.  The build will take days to complete on this arch,
   but apparently this will give us axiom on a pda.  (Will anyone use
   axiom there?)

3) Systems using dlopen (alpha, mips(el), hppa, and ia64) still cannot
   build the databases, only (apparently) due to the limit on the
   number of simultaneously opened (and dlopened) files (1024).  The
   patch I've temporarily put in to copy prebuilt databases from i386
   on these platforms allows the current build to complete on these
   arches.  

4) Building the package takes a long time on some systems, but ppc,
   alpha, and ia64 have recently successfully completed my latest
   upload.  Given earlier results, I don't expect any difficulties
   from mips(el), hppa, sparc, and s390 (thanks Gerhard for clearing
   the gcc compiler bug here!)  In principle, arm and m68k should be
   fine too, but as these machines are rather slow and less exercised
   in the areas we're using, may give us a few surprises.

5) In researching some of the latest GCL changes, I feel that it may
   be quite straightforward to eliminate the need for dlopen on the 5
   platforms mentioned above by making use of an alternate relocation
   pathway through the bfd library.  Don't know how important it is,
   but unless someone indicates they really need it, I'm going to
   focus on clearing up more ansi issues first.

Take care,

I'll certainly use it there. It may take longer than you think to build.
I've had a build going for 3 days (so far) on a 166Mhz pentium. 

It would be best to start by copying an already built src and int
directories, (tar them from a working system and untar them to the new
system) creating a blank obj and mnt directories, and then typing
make. The int directory should contain only machine-generated,
machine-independent files and it caches a lot of work (like generating
the lisp code from the spad files and the spad code from the pamphlet
files as well as the doc files).

The obj directory is machine-generated, machine-specific files (e.g.
C compiles, lisp to .o files, etc) will be regenerated as will the 
mnt directory. 

If this doesn't work somewhere please send me the tail of the console
output and I'll fix it. As Axiom continues to grow it is important
to keep this functionality stable.

I'm puzzled by this dlopen issue. Axiom doesn't keep files open during
database builds. It loads the files but I believe they are closed
after loading. Will dlopen fail after 1024 files have been used?  I
thought that file ids were reused.

You mentioned that two algebra files failed to compile. That's strange
as all of the files compile here. Is there some resource limit that
gets hit?

I'm expecting the build to complete on this slow pentium. Then I'm going
to upgrade the machine to yarrow (the latest fedora ISOs).

GCL 2.5.2 is no longer in the axiom zips directory as the 2.6.1 build
appears stable.

I tried using the tk::tkconnect function and it appears to work.
I then tried to use the latest tools widget demo and it fails
because the file contains commas outside of backquotes. Once these
are removed the file still contains dots. I've backed off this effort
for the moment and am applying all effort to getting the graphics alive.

Haven't really used dlopen too much, but to my understanding, one
file-id is used while the code in the .o file is mmapped and made
available to the running program.  Lisp, again to my knowledge, has no
'unload' command -- i.e. once code is loaded it is expected to be
available for the rest of the session -- and in any case axiom nor any
other program I've used attempts such an 'unload' to my knowledge.  So
basically yes, a lisp load implemented with dlopen will fail after
1024 loads, unless we can do something that I'm not seeing at the
moment.  One such (heavyweight) idea would be to keep a list of
dlopened files, and at some interval make a gcc system call to
concatenate these .o files into one .so, close the existing id's and
open one to the new object.  Not sure if it will work, but sounds
feasible.

Possibly.  I haven't yet investigated, and in any case, the machine is
currently unavailable.

Great!  Should be actually quite more stable than 2.5.2.

Will look into fixing these.  Must confess, never used them myself,
but they seem to have potential.

gclcvs also has the gtk library hooks checked in, but nothing has been
done with them yet.

Take care,

Dear Bill,

as I promised, I will keep you informed about my quest to run AXIOM inside
of TeXmacs. I would not yet call it nightmare, sicne it kept me from
sleeping last nights...

* FYI: I had installed the RedHat prpm of TeXmacs (a practice which worked
for many other HedHat packages on my SuSE distribution with variouse
versions) For the reasons you know already (missing path varibales, etc
this didn't work.

* Now I downloaded TeXmacs sources and tried to compile...
  -- The compilation failed to to a missing guile package
  -- I downloaded guile and ./configured, make, make install
     worked, hence I think guile has been installed successfully.
     I was able to start it, but don't know what to do with it.
  -- I did a seciond run on TeXmacs and it compiled without further
     errors.
  -- I made sure that axiom and AXIOMsys is in the path
  -- I copied tm_axiom 1.0.3 as distributed from the savannah AXIOM
     web-site and copied it to the correct places(while the RedHat rpm put
     TeXmacs in the dirs /usr/share/TeXmacs and /usr/libexec/TeXmacs the
     compiles version resides in /usr/local/share/TeXmacs and
    /usr/local/libexec/ which should be no problem.

  -- to have a reverence, I renamed my maple8 (vioa a link) into maple, so
     that the command maple launches a maple8 command line session.

* My Findings:
  -- It is impossible (for me) to detect from inside TeXmacs which version
     is running, the rpm is 1.0.2.5 while the self compiles is 1.0.2.6.
     This is annoying and there should be  a possibility to get this inforation
     in the menue Help->About
  -- After starting (the compiled) TeXmacs, I do no longer find in the
     Text->Session menue the session called Shell, thats quite awkward,
     since a shell is always in the path?
  -- TeXmacs started a scheme session and I could type something after the
     prompt, and TeXmacs came up with some scheme output (since I do not
     know scheme, I produced an error message, but it looks quite
     functioning.
  -- TeXmacs was able to strt a maple (veriosn8) session, I see the
     Maple leave stratuup message, but then a red written error message
     and further input to maple was no possible.
  -- TeXmacs is still not able to start an AXIOM session, the console says
     that tm_axiom is loaded (i.e that from savannah AXIOM) but nothing
     happens, beside that a blue session box is created. Typing in this
     box is possible but nothing happens after pressing <return>, I get
     just a new line.
     If I goto the Session menue and press close session, I get an axiom
     promt 'axiom]' but there is no further typing possible.

All in all I spent now several hours to check pathes, to move the files to
the correct place, compile guile, TeXmacs etc but didn't succed in making
TeXmacs even functional with maple (version8) (I didn't check with maple
5,6,7,9, since maple 8 might be still the most common in use and should
wotk without problems)

Given the variouse maple versions, it might be a good habit of TeXmacs to
provide tm_maple(version) files if tehre is a need to have different such
interfaces, the same may go for axiom, tm_axiom.gnu1 tm_axiom.NAG etc

I would really like to hear if other have succeded to work with TeXmacs
under SuSe, say with maple, maxima, and of course with AXIOM!

I will ponder further on what I might have done wrong and then give it
another chance. For the moment I ran out of further ideas ....

Cheers
BF.

This is not an castle in the air! I have a whole chapter in my
Habilitationsschrift (second book needed for post lecturing qualification
in Germany) and an original article which will possibly be printed the J.
of Symbolic Computation which where processed through maple. Maple ha s
filter function which allows to produce (poorly!) TeX files where maple
statements are included in a \begin{mapleinput} ... \end{mapleinput}
environment pair. Maple puts its LaTeX output into an analogous
environment. After some sed x goes to y stuff, the whole chapter/article
is simply LaTeXed (including bitex etc) to produce teh *final* printout
(no further modification hence no handmade errors are included then.

I would be *extraordinarily* intersted in a sort of pamphlet mechanism
which is flexible enough to do this type of text/algebra processing with
maple and AXIOM.

TeXmacs is not giving you the full control over the TeX code, which I
dislike personally and which I even hate beeing an editor! We had lots of
problems with Scientifiy Workplace produced TeX and I had personally
problem with TeXmacs produced TeX code, which is rather complicated.
However, If TeXmacs would support several _engines_ this would be a big
argument for me to use it (after it fiannly works on my computer properly,
see my mail on TeXmacs on SuSE 8.0)

Hence I admire (and inhabit already its stables) castles in the air!

No, it does not; the axiom-manual style should inherit from tmdoc,
but may also provide all functionality from the original axiom style.
Secondly, it is easy to write scheme functions which forget about
the additional functionality provided by tmdoc.

Yes, that is the idea. But we have to be careful about how,
precisely, this should be implemented.

Live graphics is again another topic. Ideally speaking someone should
implement an OpenGL plugin for TeXmacs, so that the user can do this
kind of manipulations both directly into the text or in a separate window.
Also, such a component would be easily reusable by the 18 other system to
which TeXmacs connects... So if someone is interested to spend a month
or so on this job, then please contact me.

I do not exactly understand what you mean, but this seems easy to do.

This is much easier to program when your document is a tree and
we already have some of these facilities in TeXmacs. So: why not
implement the others inside TeXmacs, because this will serve many
others besides axiom users?

Just look at Bills tutorial, and you will find many of them,
either bugs, or ugly exports.

No; I have to do something here...

Yes, and *much* easier to program directly inside TeXmacs,
because we already have all necessary infrastructure for it.
Moreover, TeXmacs is a *dynamic* editor, not a batch job processor,
and improvements inside TeXmacs *directly* serve to all other systems
to which we already connect.

About the attached previous discussion:
  1) What existing systems for documentation did you take a look at?
     The OMDOC DTDs might provide many of the things you need.
  2) If you have a precise idea about the DTD you want, then it will be
     worth it to spend some time to write a TeXmacs plug-in for that,
     consisting of a style file and scheme routines with interesting
     operations for your tags.
  3) Live graphics would be quite easy to implement in TeXmacs,
     if there is a volunteer to write an OpenGL plug-in.

This is strange.

Maple is not officially supported since we get no cooperation
whatsoever from MapleSoft.

We are still not fixed on the tm_axiom which has to be used,
so the open version of Axiom is not really supported yet either...

Have you tried with Pari or Maxima?

That seems like a nice task!

Isn't this 1024 file limit a system limit that can be raised up by using
shell commands?

If I do:
david@oops:~$ ulimit -a
[...]
open files                    (-n) 1024

So, doing 'ulimit -n 2048' should allow 2048 file descriptors for the
process. I tested on my machine and I need to be root to do that. Maybe
a Debian Unix expert might help?

> TeXmacs is not giving you the full control over the TeX code,

Of course not: it is not a TeX front-end. But TeX is *VERY CLEARLY*
an *OUTDATED* format for computer algebra, since it has *NO SEMANTICS*
and not even a *RELIABLE PARSER*.

I never tried Scientific Workplace, because I hate proprietary software.
So please do not compare things which have nothing to do.

When? Examples? I bet that the produced code will often be
better than what you write by hand.

I know, but as I noticed in some previous emails, the LaTeX line-breaking
code is quite heavily bugged. I would very much prefer to have the same
patch without the additional line-breaking code. Also, if I remember well
(see my previous emails), the new version does not work with the NAG
version of Axiom.

Best wishes, and thanks for your help, Joris

If I do:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/texmacs login

it succeeds. Then I do:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/texmacs co texmacs

and I get a texmacs directory containing only the CVS directory.
Any idea why I didn't get the sources?

Tim

re: diff command. sure.

re: noweb. 

ummm, there are "short term" and "long term" discussions.  In the
short term I'm just patching noweb. In the long term I have other
plans and extensions. It won't be a "fork" of noweb so much as a
rethink of the whole thing (probably with a complete rewrite). But
that's longer term. For now the only extension is the "booklet" code
by David Mentre. Literate programming is the goal; noweb is a useful
tool. If you use the installed noweb be sure to use the axiom.sty
file rather than the noweb.sty file.

re: bolt-on-the-side. 

This strategy has a lot of upsides and downsides.  One downside is
that I have to get code to run on many different ports.  I'd rather
face that problem and solve it. I want Axiom to build "out of the box"
so I have to make sure the correct version is used and the correct
patches are applied. The upside is that I can make sure that Axiom
actually works on various platforms since I can (and do) test it. If I
let the user choose "a version" or even "gcl-2.5.2" and build it
themselves it is likely they will have build problems.  These build
problems will make Axiom more painful to install.

I agree that the bolt-on-the-side strategy is not optimal, that not
everyone agrees that it is good, that it might duplicate existing
code on an individual's platform, that it makes porting painful, 
that it could (if we wanted to, but we don't) discourage giving
patches back to projects, that it makes tracking external projects
an issue, etc. 

Nevertheless, I'm still of the opinion that bolt-on-the-side (BOTS?)
is a higher-quality strategy for the Axiom pile. All the pain for
the developers and none for the users.

BSD port issues:

GCL-2.6.1 doesn't build there? I can restore GCL-2.5.2.tgz and you 
can change the switch in the Makefile. All of the code to build
2.5.2 exists. I'd like to know what you needed to change for 2.6.1

To add your changes to the Axiom build there will be a global
change to the AXIOM variable. It will end up being:

AXIOM=(yourpath)/mnt/BSD

and all of the changes for BSD will be buried in the Makefile
stanzas at the top level. Setting this variable will cause a

Makefile.BSD 

file to appear (rather than Makefile.Linux) and this will be
automatically invoked to apply the BSD changes (like using
gcl-2.5.2 rather than gcl-2.6.1).

Aaaah. OK. I remember that now. It is much easier for me, then just
to use our local noweb port, and snip it out of axiom. I'll make sure
that any local hacks get to find out about axiom.sty.

Hmm^2.

Hmmm^3. :-)

2.6.1+ is closer to building than older version, so please don't
go backwards. :-) The freeBSD patches to make GCL-2.5.3 work are
sizeable and messy.

I already have a patch that does this, but with s/BSD/freebsd/.

Right. My local build (functional, but not packaged), dikes out
the GCL build, and uses a FreeBSD GCL port (locally upgraded to
GCL-HEAD). This will be the most likely way that the FreeBSD port
will be built for distribution, as it works. The hacks/patches
to do this are small(ish), and the literate programming style
of axiom make this delightfully easy :-).

Re-engineering the FreeBSD/GCL-2.5.3 patches into Axiom is another
route, but will be an upgrading/maintenance nightmare for me, and
I'm very reluctant to go that way unless I can convice someone else
to maintain it ;-)

Mark,

re: maintaining it.

not to worry as the ultimate burden of maintaining it will fall to me.

re: freeBSD vs BSD

yeah, i seem to remember there are some differences between the various
*BSD kinfolk but I'm not sure of the differences. I guess I'm about to
get educated though. Anyway, (yourpath)/mnt/freebsd is ok.

re: diffs

where can I find the diffs?

Hi

Enclosed are patches to compile Axiom on FreeBSD. The result works,
but hasn't been extensively tested.

NOTES -

I'm using a local port of GCL to do the build. In the lsp/ dir, I
create a symlink to where the GCL sources are checked out (a hacked
GCL HEAD). The symlink is called GCL-2.7.0 for reasons that even I
can't remember. ;-)

FreeBSD uses "Berkely make", or pmake, NOT GNU make, so the GNU
make port is used to do the build, so makefiles must have "make foo
..." replaced with "${MAKE} foo ..." to pick this up.  This must
also be done to noweb, or FreeBSD's noweb port needs to be installed.

The FreeBSD build is kicked off with
$ cd <ToWhereAxiomIs>
$ export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/freebsd
$ gmake GCLVERSION=GCL-2.7.0

Good Luck!

+GCL 2.7.0 changes are due to Mark R V Murray <mark@grondar.org>
+The key problem to solve is that 2.7.0 may use the common lisp 2.0
+standard if it has been compiled with [[--with-ansi]]. Axiom builds
+GCL 2.7.0 without this option.  In Common Lisp 1.0 if you do
+(in-package 'foo) and the foo package does not exist it is created.
+In Common Lisp 2.0 if you do (in-package 'foo) and the foo package
+does not exist it is an error.  This is an incorrect fix in the
+long term. Axiom should be changed everywhere to conform to the
+common lisp 2.0 standard.
+
+This stanza will be written out when the GCLVERSION variable is
+``gcl-2.7.0''. It will overwrite the default version. See the 
+top level Makefile.pamphlet.

I suspect that "BSD" may be a better choice, if it can be shown that
this works on other BSD's, but other folks will need to verify that.

You are right. Nevertheless, as a scientist I can share most easily TeX
documents with colleagues. It sttill defacto standard. I see your ponts
and you are right.
	I could live however with a sort of TeX file where an active
environment takes some input and the math is set in TeX by the system. The
*control* which I would like to have, is to uses quite different TeX/LaTeX
classes, which we had eg distributed to authors of book chapters. If you
get these things back in totally different TeX flavours, its a nightmare.

	I will stick to TeXmacs, since it seems to be the obvious frontend
to AXIOM (beside the console) <grin>.

Once more OK, I had contact for the above given reason only. Indeed my
interest in AXIOM is partly (I like the strong typing very much too) to
get rid on the last prorietary softwar on my computer. Exactly the
ignorance ond troubles I had the last years with this proprietary softwas
(closed sorce, bugs which are never fixed, even if you send a solution...)
makes me fond of AXIOM and TeXmacs/AXIOM.

I would have to trace back my mails quite a bit to find these examples.
Its not the math I wanted to complain abaout, but the missing usage (of
teh TeXmac users by then) of journal/publisher requitred styles and
classes.

For own documents, this is not a problem, since one can copy and past the
output into another TeX file properly formatted. Perhaps TeXmacs is even
able to do it, but in my quest till now I wasn't able to do it.

Hope to get AXIOM/TeXmacs running on my SuSE box, will discuss it with a
local Linux guru too.

cheers
BF.

Bertfried,

I am sorry to hear that you are having so much trouble!
I have no experience with SuSE so for now I am at a loss
to help. But as SuSE is apparently quite common in Europe,
surely there are people who successfully run TeXmacs on
this platform. I hope they can help. Perhaps it might be
worth posting a message to

  texmacs-users@texmacs.org

I know the feeling but I am sure there are better things
to keep you from sleeping at night! <grin>

This is normal. Yes guile is required. But you should be
careful to note which version of guile that you install.
I have seen reports of TeXmacs errors with some versions
of guile on some systems. I am not sure which version is
best (Joris might tell you.) but probably not the newest
version.

Good. Did you also to make install? Does TeXmacs startup
normally, building a bunch of fonts etc. Can you display
the help pages?

Correct, it should be no problem.

I agree. I hope that it is implemented soon.

Oh, oh. Something is wrong! You should have Shell and it should
work. If you do not have this, then I think there is still
something wrong with the TeXmacs installation.

That is good.

What is the error message?

Please try it with Maple release 5. I.e. Change your symbolic
maple link to maple5.

If a little bit of programming in "C" does not worry you,
you might try to set the debugging option in the tm_axiom.c
file. You will see some comments near the beginning of the
file that tell you how to set the debugging. Edit the tm_axiom.c
file and then re-compile it and copy it where TeXmacs will see
it. Now when you start Axiom a file will be created that shows
the commands that are sent too and from Axiom. Maybe this can
help us to see what is going wrong.

But I am still worried why you do not have a Shell session
option. Something is indeed strange.

I would hope so but the people who wrote the TeXmacs interface
for Maple do not seem to have had much cooperation from Maplesoft
about solving problems. And we know how hard it can be (sometimes)
to get the information that one needs.

I have heard that there are two different interfaces available
for TeXmacs - Maple, but I am not sure which one is packaged
with TeXmacs. If necessary we can ask Christian EVEN
che@math.uvsq.fr who is the author of these programs.

If/when time permits I still intend to write a version of
tm_maple to work with the new OpenMaple interface, but so
far time does not permit ...

As usual there has not been enough work done on this. And
the developer of TeXmacs does not like non-free software.

Do you have any opportunity to use another version of
Linux? Perhaps when you see how it works on a platform
that is known to work, it will be easier to see what is
different and what needs to change for SuSE.

Bertfried,

I found a reference to an older version of TeXmacs for
SuSE 9.0

http://www.suse.de/en/private/products/suse_linux/i386/packages_professio=
nal
/texmacs.html

So I presume that at least TeXmacs version 1.0.1.21 also
worked with SuSE 8.0, however I can seem to find that
particular version on www.texmacs.org anymore. But you
might try

http://www.texmacs.org/Download/ftp/targz/TeXmacs-1.0.1.24-src.tar.gz

which apparently the last stable version before 1.0.2.x

I noticed that SuSE has been purchased by Novell. I suppose
that is a good thing ... ?

Regards,
Bill Page.

The version of the Axiom tutorial that I uploaded to the
Axiom website does not use nor depend on Hyperdoc at all.
The embedded tex macros that were used by the tutorial have
been replaced with (more or less) equivalent TeXmacs "style"
macros/functions.

tmdoc is the style that is used by the TeXmacs documentation.
I did not use it because 1) I didn't understand it 2) it
would involve significant changes throughout the text of
the tutorial. By writing a few simple new texmacs style
macros I was able to convert almost all of the LaTeX code
for the tutorial into TeXmacs native file format.

I am not sure what you mean by: "Using tmdoc would break things
in hyperdoc. We'll have to work out some compromise." since
as I see it right now, there is no way to directly use the
same coding for the tutorial in both TeXmacs and Hyperdoc.
For the most part TeXmacs is a (more or less) complete
replacement for the old Hyperdoc functionality of Axiom.
But it is not a one-for-one replacement and some things are
missing (such as live graphics).

Still according to my (admitted limited) experience with the
tutorial, most things that were originally coded in LaTeX do
come over rather easily to TeXmacs

Regards,
Bill Page.

Well, I'd consider our noweb patches to be a fork only if we decided
to distribute them in some independent form. Since we only use it
within the project and don't "advertise" it as a separate package I'd
characterize it as an "adaptation" rather than a "fork". But it hardly
matters.

I'd much rather the projects integrate the patches as it means that I
don't have to maintain patches but, as you say, there are sometimes issues.

Stuff made by noweb goes into mnt/$SYS/bin. Is that used at run-time?
If the user already has noweb installed, which one gets used by 1) the
user and 2) by Axiom? This comes down to $PATH issues, and what Axiom
tries to do.

Is it possible to compile Aldor programs using the Axiom distribution?

Here my test session:
(1) -> )compile test.as
   Compiling AXIOM source code from file /home/stefan/test.as using
      AXIOM-XL compiler and options
-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y
$AXIOM/algebra
      Use the system command )set compiler args to change these
      options.

Hello Joris,

Ok. Currently, the line-breaking algorithm is used for two things: (1)
the line-breaking itself and (2) the rewriting of \root into \sqrt.

Bill, do you think you could disable the line-breaking algorithm while
keeping the rewriting of \root? Could you send me such a tm_axiom.c? If
not possible, I'll start from tm_axiom.c 1.0.1 which does not include
this line-breaking code and submit a new release to Joris.

The most recent release of tm_Axiom should work with both free and NAG
Axiom. The axiom binary has been renamed into AXIOMsys for this purpose.

Yours,
d.

As far as I have understood, no. The free release (i.e. current CVS on
Savannah) of Axiom does not include the Aldor compiler.

David,

Version 1.0.1 of tm_axiom at

http://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=3Daxiom

http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/axiom/axiom_texmacs.pkg/1.0.1/tm_axio=
m.c

is the (almost) vanilla tm_axiom.c from TeXmacs
(no line breaking) but with special code to handle
\root ... .\of.

Simply changing 'axiom' to 'AXIOMsys' in this version should
do what you want (I think).

If you do this, I am quite curious how the Axiom output
in the tutorial will look.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Yes, but if you really want to use TeX for representing trees,
why not just use a format which has been natively designed for that,
like XML or Lisp/Scheme (I prefer the latter)? And then, why not natively
work with trees all the time and quit the plain ASCII hell? It is amazing
that people who like symbolic algebra are so reluctant to work with
symbolic representations of documents...

Usually, you just have to change \documentclass{article} into
\documentclass{adumbtexstyle}.

Please let us know if you still have problems. *Don't* take the TeXmacs
RPM shipped by SuSE, because they took a heavily bugged version :^(
I don't understand why the RPM from texmacs.org does not work for you,
since it has been linked statically. I suppose that /usr/bin is in your PATH...

re: aldor compiler

The aldor compiler is noy yet integrated as part of the distribution.
It should be available at www.aldor.org.

Greetings!  There seems to be a problem compiling axiom on arm:

http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?&pkg=axiom&ver=0.0.0cvs-11&arch=arm&stamp=1068398045&file=log&as=raw

This build has been of particular interest to axiom upstream, as it
opens the possibility of running axiom on a pda (zaurus, right?)

I had a build going on debussy to investigate, but the machine
apparently went down over the weekend.  Furthermore, the unstable
chroot there appeared a bit out of date. gcc was at ~3.2 AFAICR, and
there were two compilation errors showing up on my by-hand build which
do not appear in the autobuilder logs with the more up to date
toolchain.  

I can obviously wait until debussy comes back up and install the
newest compiler locally in my home directory.  Its just that this
build takes days to complete, so I'd like to use a stable machine with
the latest toolchain to avoid wasting time.  rameau and europa are
reserved for buildd only, right?  Don't have an account on elara, so
don't know about this.

In sum, I'm looking for

1) build machine advice from those in the know
2) comments on the nature of the build failure in the above log.  I
   can't tell if the process just died with no error output (which
   I've never seen before), was too slow for the timeout threshhold,
   or was in an infinite loop.  I don't suppose the output of the
   buildd up to the point of failure is stored anywhere?  That would
   be ideal.

Take care,

Camm,

I'm setting up a machine at home with the zaurus tool chain for
cross compiles. I'll look into the build issues. It will take a
while because the machine is painfully slow (166Mhz). Since I'm
the only one likely to use it anytime soon don't worry about it.

Greetings!

One does at minimum need root priveleges for this, and I thought also
access to /proc/sys to set a kernel parameter, though I'm not sure on
this latter point.  In any case, there is no clean way to make such an
exception for axiom in the autobuilders, so it seems wiser to address
this at the GCL or axiom level.

Take care,

Memory fails me but I believe that accounts can be set up with 
a larger limit value as the default.

Joris, I have uploaded a new patch against TeXmacs 1.0.2.4 (no
difference with 1.0.2.6): patch #2275.

It includes:

 - no line-breaking

 - support of latest free Axiom and NAG one

 - handling of \root 

Could you integrate this patch (and by the way drop patch #2242) into
TeXmacs source tree?

Bill, how I should do that? I won't have time to redo the whole
tutorial, so have you a part that you would me to test?

Yours,
d.

I can make an account on smackdown for you, if you want.  Just mail me

Good point. I'll rename it to axiom-specific names so it doesn't
collide with an installed version.

Could you please make ${TANGLE} and ${WEAVE} resolve to something
that can be overriden at the root level? That way, if there is a
working "tangle" off the path, we can use that, otherwise default
it to use (say) ${SPAD}/${AXIOMTANGLE}.

My local patches to do this are _big_ :-)

Mark,

I'm not sure I understand what you want me to do.  What does
"overwritten at the root level" mean?  I had planned to subsume the
tangle and weave machinery into the "document" command which currently
exists.  If you can be more specific about what you'd like me to
achieve we can design a solution you like and I'll implement that
instead (with all appropriate ego-driven complaints, of course :-) )

At the moment, a lot of files have ${SPAD}/notangle, with ${SPAD} being
the sort of variable that you don't want to change unless you like pain.

It would be nice if all uses of "notangle" and "noweave" were set
somehow as ${TANGLE} and ${WEAVE} (or whatever names), in one file,
in a way that can be overridden, rather than having to edit a whole
bunch of .pamphlet files.

So if (say) the root Makefile.pamphlet file had

TANGLE=${SPAD}/notangle
WEAVE=${SPAD}/noweave

(or functional equivalent)

and the rest of the files just picked up ${TANGLE} and ${WEAVE} from
there, it would make porters' lives much easier :-).

If you are planning to replace all instances of "${SPAD}/notangle" and
"${SPAD}/noweave" with two scripts that use these files, then that also
makes life easier, in that only those scripts will need to be hacked
to use an already-provided noweb suite.

Going a little further, lots of the build is dependant on "noweb".
Can that be replaced with ${NOWEB}, so that if folks aready have a
functional noweb, that can be defined away to nothing, and thus ignored?

Mark,

There is a variable in the top level Makefile.pamphlet called
TANGLE=
which points to the notangle executable. The weave function is never
called directly as I've already subsumed it under the "document" command.
The notangle command will be subsumed  when I make another major cleanup sweep.

I've moved Axiom's version of noweb's executables out of $AXIOM/bin so
they don't show up on the user's path. Thus a user that has noweb installed
will still get the standard version of noweb rather than Axiom's patched
version. Axiom will use the patched version to build, not the user's version.

I'm not sure how this will help (although it is cleaner) since the standard
noweb has a bug which Axiom patches. The fix was never accepted because
I changed the C code rather than the awk/sed scripts. I don't use either
awk or sed for anything but trivial one-liners so I'm not skilled enough
with these tools to make the change in a way that will be accepted.
(Plus I'm about to change the C code again to fix the tmpname error).

In any case there will eventually be an Axiom "document" command that
knows how to do all of the necessary magic for everything we need done
with literate programs.

I've checked in the changes.

Tim

I may be able to help here. Are we talking about a patch whose essence

Thanks. This patch finally works for both versions for me.
Notice that the mathematical constant "e" is not printed nicely
in the new version. You might want to output it as \mathe.
Similarly, TeXmacs provides \mathi, \mathpi and \mathd.

Done.

While we build these guidelines and the infrastructure required,
we are recommending submitting packages to fedora.us

I'm doing a test build right now. There are a zillion more ${SPAD}/notangle
that I had to patch locally. Could you please do those as well?

Also, about 20 files had references to ../../../../mnt/linux/bin/axiom.sty.
I've locally hacked these, but I guess they'll need more general treatment.

I'm using the FreeBSD port of noweb for this job. It's looking pretty clean.
I have got your patch to noweb engineered into our noweb, and I'll get it
committed.

The current patch set is about half a meg; most of that is notangle stuff.
When I have it extracted, I'll give you a URL to fetch it from.

I was unaware that the SPAD variable was used anymore.
I removed the only existing use (in the document command) last night.
I grepped the sources and did not find a ${SPAD}/notangle reference.
Clearly I missed something. What file does this?

${SPADBIN}/notangle still exists in Lattice.pamphlet but this file is
now purely used for documentation purposes. Bill and I were using this
information to build a lattice.

The references to axiom.sty are bogus in two ways: 
(1) I missed the "build location" vs "source location" path walk
(2) I need to figure out how to put axiom.sty on some sort of path
    that tex uses (anybody know how to do this?)

The issue for "committing the patch" (as I understand it) is that
the C code is "frozen" and no patches are accepted that change it.
I could be wrong. I'm about to patch the tmpname warning so you
might want to wait a day or two. I'll send you a message once I've
tested it and put it in the cvs.

D'oh! My mistake - its ${SPADBIN}/notangle :-]

I'll put my patch up shortly, its taking a while. I found a lot of
${SPADBIN}/notangle references.

NP :-)

You need to look at kpathsea. I'll get back to you with
specifics.

That would explain why there is a patch for .c and .nw? I didn't
look too closely at the .c patch, as it looked like a patch to
generated cose, and was thus a little messy ;-).

NP - I'll catch that when it comes.

It seems to me that we could define a set of XML tags that are
isomorphic to the latex tags. So any latex tag could be rewritten
as XML and any XML tag could be rewritten as latex. These could
even be extended in a normal way to user-defined latex tags.

Axiom's document command could perform this translation.
This would give a common ground between TeXmacs and Axiom.

Mark,

If you do a cvs checkout all of the ${SPADBIN}/notangle references
should be gone. I'm unclear why you want to upload patches for this.
Did I miss something?

My suggestion would be a toplevel Makefile.inc or
Makefile.linux, which defines all the globally relevant
variables and which is included by every Makefile.
This would solve the problem with the passing of
environment variables from Makefile to Makefile,
which I find rather clumsy.

Er, the diffs are to show where you missed some :-)

Yeah. A boatload of ${SPADBIN}/notangle references? :-)

Have a look at http://people.freebsd.org/~markm/axiom.diff.gz

Tim,

Well, er, it is a "little" more complicated than that. <grin>

But you might take a look at MATHML in

  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html

which is more or less the state of the art. There are several
other similar programs, see for example:

  http://www.albany.edu/%7Ehammond/gellmu/

see also

  http://tbookdtd.sourceforge.net/

Unfortunately this does not immediately give a common ground
with TeXmacs since TeXmacs does not currently support XML.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Juergen,

Variable passing thru the environment is the only known way to pass
this information. The original make did not have an include mechanism.
The makefiles don't use any (well, almost any. We now use $(shell) and
$(notdir)) non-vanilla make features. This is for historical reasons
and I guess it's time to assume gnu-make is available everywhere.

I'll look into the include mechanism.

Tim

Not yet. We are trying to port to the windows platform by the effort
is still continuing. We are trying to build using the mingw environment.
If you join the axiom-mail mailing list at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom
it will be announced when the port works. Or you can join axiom-developer
and join the porting effort.

Alexei,

I think the problem with noweb is quite easy to fix, but
the difficult problem will be GCL which does not build
under Cygwin. The GCL project is currently looking for
someone willing to take on the task of creating a GCL
build for Cygwin.

GCL builds under MSYS but then there are some remaining
problems with a few Unix-style add-ins routines for GCL
which do not compile.

In both cases the obstruction to a Windows build of AXIOM
are (relatively) small.

Bill Page.

Mark,

I've changed yet more of the ${SPADBIN}/notangle to ${TANGLE}.
I believe I've gotten them all this time.

I also reviewed the input tests and reviewed the open bugs.

Camm,

I'm coding a fix that will only rebuild the databases if the
algebra has changed. There is a "marker" file called
int/algebra/dbcomplete
which, if present, means that the databases are ok. To force
a database rebuild this marker file is removed. So you can just
"touch" the marker file and it will skip database builds. This
fix should be available later tonight after the test phase
completes.

Tim

Camm,

I've changed the makefile so it will only rebuild the databases if the
algebra changes. If you do a normal build and it fails because of the
number of database files you can:

touch int/algebra/dbcomplete  <= marks databases as complete
cp *.daase mnt/linux/algebra  <= hand copy files
make                          <= restart and finish the make

Changing any algebra file or NRLIB automatically removes dbcomplete
and will cause the databases to build again.

Tim

Hi

Enclosed is a really clean (but not perfect) FreeBSD build for
Axiom. The GCL used is GCL-HEAD with some fixes to make it work
on FreeBSD. I suspect that it will work with stock GCL-2.6.1,
once that has been ported.

NOTES:

For FreeBSD, we need the build to use external ports where possible,
so GCL and noweb are assumed to be installed on the system already.
For the purposes of building the FreeBSD port that will go on the
CDS, and will be binary-installable off the 'net, this makes the
cleanest solution. I will ensure that the FreeBSD GCL and noweb are
suitably fixed for the job.

There is a weird 'ifneq "FreeBSD" "FreeBSD"'/'endif' check in the
patch; I'm not much of a noweb/gmake hacker, so this is a placeholder
that says "On FreeBSD please don't do this bit". I'm sure that there
is a much better way of doing this. Any suggestions?

If GCLVERSION is set to "gcl-system", then GCL is not built locally,
and the system GCL is used instead. I've used some patches of Camm
Maguire's, and I could easily have broken other builds. Suggestions
on how to do this properly for all cases requested!

I fixed some linuxism's (I think).

I've partially documented my stuff. It may need some padding out.

At one stage, I had utterly remoived all mention of noweb. Some of
this remains. Please ignore bits where I seem to have hacked too
hard.

There are some compile-fixes where I passed ${CCF} to the CC command
line - this is so that the X includes can be picked up. Is there a
cleaner way to do this?


Axiom is a great program! Thanks for enabling its use! :-)

Mark,

Awesome. Thanks. I'll try to build it tonight.
The systems I'm using for FreeBSD are not network connected
and cannot reach CDS. I have to hand-install. Where is CDS?

Typo. CD's. Our Compact Disk installation. We haven't built
any that are of much use to you yet.

If you want to download some install ISO images, then best get
them from ftp.freebsd.org. I'm doing my development on FreeBSD
CURRENT (soon to be v 5.2), but you should be OK with v 4.9
or v 5.1).

Are you interested in my patches to GCL-current (HEAD)?

Thanks for clarifying, Bill!  While MSYS will always be our primary
Windows port, as it is judged a superior Windows development
environment in several respects by our gcl developer in the know, we
would of course appreciate in addition someone undertaking a cygwin
effort, simply because as far as I can tell it appears to be quite
popular with users.  If anyone knows of an interested party, please
keep me informed.

Take care,

Hello,

A looong time ago, we wanted to graph Axiom algebra lattice. Martin
RUBEY proposed to use Tulip[1]. I have given it a try.

What I have done:

 1. start from src/algebra/Lattice.pamphlet;

 2. produce a Lattice.txt with only depency information;

 3. use a small Perl script (txt2tlp.pl) to transform this text file
    into a native Tulip file (.tlp file);

 4. load the graph into Tulip (1015 nodes, 7720 edges), play with Tulip
    and try to understand its user interface. :)


The good news: Tulip is able to handle graphs of that size. The bad
news: right now, I don't found the produced graph of any usefulness. But
there are some many combinations that I'm a bit lost. And the
documentation seems not up-to-date and a bit light. Somebody else might
produce a more useful output.

I don't plan to do more work on this in the short term, so you'll find
at below URL the source and produced files. I've included the file
"img/lattice-gem3d.eps.bz2" which is a bzip2-ed EPS file containing an
image of a produced graph. If you want to load a file into Tulip, give a
try to "lattice-gem3d.tlp".

  http://www.linux-france.org/~dmentre/code/axiom/lattice.tar.gz


I've used Tulip 1.2.5 of Debian unstable.


Some remarks for further work: 

 1. as it was pointed out before, it might be preferable to parse the
    compilation log to extract more up-to-date dependency information.
    And as pointed out by Juergen[2], some dependencies are not printed
    by default so an image without preloads should be used (I don't know
    how to do that);

 2. while the layering information is available in the Lattice.txt file,
    this layering is not used to produce Tulip graph clusters by my
    small perl script. It might help to make the produced graphs more
    readable.


Yours,
d.

Camm

I used bits of your Debian build for Axiom to get my FreeBSD build
to work. The resultant programs runs just fine, but only if I don't
delete the build dirs. The problem is that the locations of the
loadable modules get hardcoded into the AXIOMsys binary, resulting
in the installed (.../mnt/${SYS}/...) stuff not being used.

I'm a useless Lisp hacker, so I'm a little lost here. Any suggestions?

(I posted my patches a couple of days ago, and I can supply them again
if anyone needs them).

Mark,

There are 2 shell variables that can affect where axiom will look for things.

The first, called AXIOM, defines where the system lives. 
When set it during the build time it tells the build 2 pieces of information:

AXIOM=(yourpath)/axiom/mnt/(sys)

The (yourpath) tells the build where the sources live.
The (sys) tells the build what kind of target system to build.
(It is possible to do cross-compiles to other (sys) but we don't yet
exploit that).

The second variable is DAASE. It is set to the path ABOVE the algebra
directory. Thus if the databases (*.daase) live in (yourDBpath)/algebra
you would set:

DAASE=(yourDBpath)

Remember to leave the "algebra" directory off the end of the path.
This variable is only used during test builds. I play games with the
database locations. Users should not have to set this variable but
Camm may use it to point to other databases.

Tim

Mark,

I forgot to mention that you can move the system anywhere after the
build completes by changing the AXIOM variable. You only need to 
move the "mnt" subdirectory to have a running system. All the rest
can be removed. Thus, once you build a system and want to install it
either type 

make install 

which will install the system in "/usr/local/axiom" by default and
put the axiom command into "/usr/local/axiom/mnt/(sys)/bin/axiom"
by default. If you want it to live elsewhere, like "opt" and want
the command elsewhere like "/usr/local/bin" try:

make install INSTALL=/bin/axiom COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/axiom

Alternatively you can hand copy the system to a new location.
You only need to copy the mnt subdirectory thus:

mkdir /my/local/hacks/myaxiom                   <= where to put axiom
cp (yourpath)/axiom/mnt /my/local/hacks/myaxiom <= copy the execution tree
export AXIOM=/my/local/hacks/myaxiom/mnt/linux  <= tell axiom where it lives
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH                    <= put it on your path

This is the one that seems to be broken by the local patching.

I need to use this too, it seems, as it fixes problems. The install
location is not the same as the build location, and the build location
seems to become hardcoded into AXIOMsys after the Debian fixes are in.

Hi

I'm doing the below, but local patching is breaking things. However,
the DAASE env var fixed it :-).

Greetings!  Of course, Tim said it already.  Just wanted to note that
in the current Debian package, AxiomSYS is invoked via a shell script
wrapper which sets the AXIOM environment variable.  I haven't done
anything with the DAASE variable.

Take care,

Camm,

I'm in the process of recovering everything about the original axiom
along with new extensions. I have the graphics build process integrated
into one of my development paths and I'm nearly at the point of testing
it standalone. In order to make it run with Axiom I need to also recover
the sman functionality which is next on the list. The sman program starts
both AXIOMsys (optionally wrapped with clef), the graphics, and the 
hypertex program. 

I have a TCL/TK front end for Magnus right now that I want to rip off
and put in front of Axiom. The Magnus interface, called ZLC (zero-learning
curve) is a completely novel way of doing math. The reason I asked you
about the GCL/TK stuff was that I was thinking of recoding it. I need
to figure out a lisp-based, portable graphics package so I can recode it
in lisp and use it in future ports.

Tim

I maintained a mailing list of people who were interested in Axiom.
The list was quite active before the source code was released but
died waiting for something to happen. I promised that I'd send everyone
on that list a note when Axiom became available. That was last year.

Today I hand wrote notes to approximately 200 people. I tried to
skip over people who were already subscribed to these lists but I'm
not certain I was successful. To anyone already subscribed I'm sorry
for telling you what you already know.

I'm trying to do a Debian build and get the following failure
(using 2.5.2 and 2.6.1):

fat_string.c:17:17: bfd.h: No such file or directory
fat_string.C:18:21: bfdlink.h: No such file or directory
fat_string.c:228: error: parse error before "bfd_combined_table_update"

etc. Where should bfd.h and bfdlink.h come from? I don't have root
on these machines so I'll have to put them in my home directory and
add them to libpath.

:) You should read your own axiom/README. :)

  FAQ 9: GCL does not build on my system: libbfd.a and bfd.a are missing

  We are using the option \texttt{--enable-statsysbfd} when building GCL
  (see lsp/Makefile) so libbfd.a and bfd.h files are necessary on your
  system.

  On Debian GNU/Linux, the needed package is 'binutils-dev'.


So you need the debian package binutils-dev.

You'll find it at:
http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/binutils-dev.html  (use Download
button).

To unpack a debian package, follow Camm's guideline:
http://mail.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-10/msg00368.html

I hope it helps,
Yours,
d.

Hi Tim!  As David already indicated

1) get the latest binutils from
   ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/binutils/...deb
   for the arch you are working on

2) Unpack in your home dir with
   dpkg --fsys-tarfile ......deb | tar xf -

3) Set your shell environment as 
   export
   C_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/usr/include:$C_CINCLUDE_PATH
   export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

You should then be good to go.  Can do the same with the gmp package
if you want to configure GCL with --enable-dynsysgmp.

Take care,

Mark,

It appears that Carlo Traverso has a 64 bit linux dual-xeon processor
which I'll be able to access. I'll apply your patches and test them
there once I get access.

Camm, David,

re: broken build on HP Testdrive machines

Yeah, I really should read my own README. What can I say, it was way
past midnight :-)

I'll apply those fixes and restart the build.

re: Fedora

Since RedHat has dropped support for RedHat 9 (or will in April) I
joined Fedora (RedHat's open source version) as a developer. I'm 
looking into making Axiom a supported package as part of the Fedora
releases. I built a Fedora machine locally and the build succeeded.
I need to try running alien on your debian version to create an RPM
and see if that will install. I know you've done it before but could
you point me at your latest Debian apt package again?

re: Red Flag Linux

Also, Camm, I have a copy of Red Flag Linux (the chinese version of
Linux). I can't read the install screens but I have a student who can.
He also knows a few people who do translations from English to Chinese
and I'm going to find out if I can get Axiom redone so it supports
"native languages". If I get someone to do the translations I'll see
if they are interested in GCL also.

Native language support in pamphlets would be useful. It is rumored 
that there are languages other than english on the planet :-) I think
this will be important in the long run, especially if we get Axiom
running on every desktop.

re: distributions

IBM has an initiative, "Linux on the Desktop", and I'm trying to get
a connection to them. If we can get a cross-effort of Axiom, IBM 
education, and IBM Linux on the Desktop we will be closer to being
available everywhere.

Tim

Thanks!

I can give you an account on a FreeBSD machine in a couple of days,
if you think this will help? It won't be the fastest box around, but
you'll have it mostly to yourself :-).

Excellent! I have to replace the hard disk in the machine I'm going
to use for the purpose. Please yell If I haven't gotten back to you
in three days (End of Tuesday for you!)

Have you had a look at my patches? I'd be most grateful if you could
commit some of the more obvious ones, like the one that adds a '\' to
the end of a line in src/doc/Makefile.pamphlet, and so forth.

Thanks!

I've looked at the patches but that's about the extent of it.
I started to set up a version on the HP Testdrive machines to
test your patches but the version I uploaded to test ended up
breaking (ref the Debian stuff) and I spent all of my time
trying to get it off the floor. So, nope, I haven't gotten to
your patches yet. I haven't forgotten them though as that's
what I set out to test. I can't commit any changes until I've
run them thru testing. You don't know how often I've made a
trivial change and broken the build :-)

I'll ping you on tuesday if I don't hear from you.
Tim

Camm Maquire has already packaged Axiom for Debian. 
I have access to a 64bit system now and I plan to look into the port.

Larry,

> I don't seem to have "cvs".  Can I use ncftp or something like that? 

re: lack of cvs

I'll make the source files into a tar file and put it up on the Axiom website.
It will take a day or so as I can never remember the magic incantation that
uploads a file to the download area. Maybe I've documented the process in
the README file but it appears that I never read what I write so I have to
rediscover it :-)

I'll send you a message once the tar.gz of the sources exists.

Tim

(You can currently substitute several arches for i386, pretty much all
except for arm and m68k at present)

Alien should work just fine.  I'd be interested in knowing if it does
not.

Great!  This would be wonderful.  Have to say I'm quite ignorant of

On the laptop it appears you need libbfd.a
I didn't run into this on Mandrake but did on Debian.
I have a FAQ item that says:

> FAQ 9: GCL does not build on my system: libbfd.a and bfd.a are missing

> We are using the option \texttt{--enable-statsysbfd} when building GCL (see

I'm not sure which package contains libbfd on Mandrake distros
but I'll look and get back to you> On my workstation (P4 under RedHat):

Segmentation violation? Wow, that's odd. It appears that the linker
failed. What kind of workstation hardware are you running?

The build process starts by building GCL, a common lisp. 
You never got past the lisp building stage and have yet to
begin building Axiom. GCL runs on Mandrake and is widely
ported. I understand the missing library issue on the laptop
but am at a loss to explain the segfault.

If you installed the latest Axiom over a previous version you would
have to do a 

  make clean

first. Axiom caches a large amount of work. In this case it looks like
you have a cached version of noweb (which has changed in this release).
Axiom sees the file /home/fmv/axiom/noweb which is a "marker file"
that tells Axiom not to rebuild noweb. The make clean command removes
this file.

If you install over a previous version by just expanding the tar.gz
file you'll still have the 'noweb' file.

Hello Camm,

I think there are a few bugs in the stable release of gcl (gcl_2.6.1-
18.tar.gz), for the Windows port of gcl, in lines 144 to 160 of 
gcl/makefile. These lines create the file gclm.bat, that runs Gcl under 
Windows.

- First, there is reference to version 2.5.0 instead of 2.6.1, which 
prevents the created gclm.bat from running Gcl.

- Second, these lines are apparently written to run Gcl under any version 
of Windows (and in particular under Win98), but gclm.bat does not work 
under Win98, the code generated is broken. It works under Win2000/XP 
though but, in this case, it is too complicated, the first 8 lines could 
be removed (they are needed for Win9x only). 

The last binary version for Windows (dated 20031026) installs correctly 
and works, even under Win98, but it uses a file gcl.bat to run Gcl, which 
is probably created by the Windows installer, as it refers to 2.6.1, not 
to 2.5.0. I am not quite sure, as I did not find the install script for 
Windows, but there is anyway something that is not quite in phase with 
readme.mingw, as it says Gcl can be run from gclm.bat.

It is not important that gclm.bat be broken, when only the Windows 
executable is required, as gcl.bat does the job (in that case, just 
deleting the lines in gcl/makefile would clean the file), but it might 
have some consequences for Axiom, as it uses the sources of Gcl, as far as=
 
I understand (the archive gcl-2.6.1.tgz included in axiom/zips uses the 
same makefile, with reference to 2.5.0 etc.) ?

Best wishes,

   On the laptop it appears you need libbfd.a

I have libbfd, but only a dynamic library:

norroy% find /usr -name "libbfd*" -print
/usr/lib/libbfd-2.12.90.0.15.so
/usr/lib/libbfd.so

I have libiberty.h but no library:

norroy% find /usr -name "libiberty*" -print
/usr/include/libiberty.h

   I didn't run into this on Mandrake but did on Debian.
   I have a FAQ item that says:

   > FAQ 9: GCL does not build on my system: libbfd.a and bfd.a are missing
   > 
   > We are using the option \texttt{--enable-statsysbfd} when building GCL (see
   > lsp/Makefile) so libbfd.a and bfd.h files are necessary on your system.
   > 
   > On Debian GNU/Linux, the needed package is 'binutils-dev'.

   I'm not sure which package contains libbfd on Mandrake distros
   but I'll look and get back to you.

Ok, is --enable-statsysbfd really mandatory?
Btw I could not find this faq on the Axiom web page. Where is it?

The make clean doesn't remove the file noweb.

I must be root to start make.
  The right on directories are too limited.

Thanks for your help !

And is it able to improve the interpret ?
I like to have exactly the same syntax in interpret and when I read a fil=
e ?
And I like to use it in emacs. (I do so for mupad)

You write that Axiom sources are in tex files with explain.
What *.dvi file must I read if I want to understand the interpret ?

Have a good day !

If you suspect oddities with your bfd setup, you can add the following
configure flags:

--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd

This will build a local copy of the bfd library from the GCL source
tree.  An ugly fork, but provided for situations like this.

Yeah at this stage there was clearly a miscompilation.  You can also
add --enable-debug to the configure line, rebuild, and run the command
above under gdb to see what is going on.  Make sure you have a decent
gcc version.  If you want to try installing pre-built gcl binaries,
take a look at 

http://people.debian.org/~camm/gcl

If Mandrake is rpm based, you can probably run alien on the deb and
make an installable rpm.  If you go this route, then there are a few
minor patches to the axiom source tree which enable it to be built
with an external gcl.  Please let me know if you need these.

Perhaps someone wants to maintain gcl for Mandrake?

Take care,

Greetings, and thanks for your report.  I'm  cc'ing our Windows
developer, who I believe is away at the moment, so please be patient.
I'd like his input before trying to commit anything.

Perhaps someone could fill me in at some point on whether
1) All these versions of Windows are binary compatible
2) If two different .bat files are needed
3) If we can't make the 'version origin' the files majvers and
        minvers, which do wind up setting si::*gcl-version* in the
        image itself.

Take care,

Just curious, didn't know there was a 64bit xeon.  GCL will detect
and use 64bit correctly on ia64, alpha, and amd64 -- others I'm not
sure. 

Take care,

This is a change to the way memory is handled under Fedora.
I'll look at the clisp issue because we want to eventually port to clisp.
I'll also try to compile TeXmacs and ADVI just to check.

Subject: Executable memory: some apps that work on RH9 don't on FC1
From: Gerard Milmeister <gemi@bluewin.ch>
To: fedora-devel-list@redhat.com

Some software, among them clisp, scm and mit-scheme don't work anymore
with FC1. One problem seems to be that on FC1 stack and malloced memory
is no longer executable, at least not without using mprotect.
Interpreters and compilers like the above commonly allocate a piece of
memory and fill it with executable code. I am sure they can be adapted
to work on FC1, but I would have preferred that the FC1 kernel would
behave in the same way as the RH9 one. Is there any way to disable this
behaviour. Trying to get the problem fixed by the upstream developers
will probably take a long time, and it seems that other Linux distros
don't show this problem...

Regards,
Gérard

Camm,

Memory is managed in a new way in Fedora (the new redhat) distro.
For instance, you can't execute from stack allocated memory.

GCL will not build on Fedora Core 1:

Roland,

I just built a machine with the latest Fedora and tried to build Axiom.
Axiom depends on GCL, Gnu Common Lisp. It appears that all of the 
lisps are broken under the new memory model.

Can you give me some pointers to any documentation or source code in
Fedora that might give me a clue about how to fix this? I understand
there might be a compiler switch but haven't found any documentation.

If this binary was created with old tools and has no PT_GNU_STACK marker,
then it should get executable stack by default.  More likely the issue is
that it calls malloc and expects the memory returned to be executable.
The Scheme runtime needs to be changed to use mmap when executability matters.

Greetings!  I'm skeptical of this conclusion.  You're not even getting
to the point of loading and running compiled lisp objects.  I'd
suggest configuring with --enable-debug, and running the 'raw_pre_gcl'
command you show here under gdb.  Rex Dieter, I believe, posted
success recently on building GCL for Fedora.

Take care,

To clarify, my original post was to note that gcl *failed* to build/run 
under Fedora Core.

Subject: Re: Executable memory: some apps that work on RH9 don't on FC1


You can disable the exec-shield functionality globally with
/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield, but that doesn't do anything different for an
older binary that is not marked or for a binary that is marked as requiring
executable stack.  exec-shield is always disabled for those execs.

The issue you are having is probably that malloc does not use PROT_EXEC in
its mmap-based allocations.  Executability should be enabled in the brk
area when exec-shield is disabled.  Verify the situation by looking at
/proc/PID/maps for the process in question.

We don't execute code off the stack.  Rather we allocate room on the
heap for it with sbrk, and then do an explicit mprotect to make it
executable.  However, the build is failing way before this stage.
Simple compiled and linked C code into raw_pre_gcl won't run.

Take care,

Unfortunately I don't think we've succeeded in getting proper documentation
up to date in step with the implementation of the features.  I have written
this explanation up a couple of times, but AFAIK there is no good place to
look for it.  Documentation volunteers take note! :-)

The important changes have to do with what memory will be executable
(i.e. have the PROT_EXEC bit set on those pages).  If you have an issue
with memory layout that changed, other than the question of executability,
then you almost surely have a bug in your application or have uncovered one
in the system.  I'd be glad to help you understand which of those it is and
how to fix it.  There is at least one known issue of this nature (brk
address).  Please try to determine if nonexecutability alone is what's
breaking you, and if not, please post the details of your problem so we can
determine what different problem there might be.

The status quo ante was that the stack was executable, and the brk area
(used by malloc for small allocations) was executable, and on x86 pages
with PROT_READ set but PROT_EXEC did not have any enforcement of
nonexecutability anyway.  All of these things are either just as they were
before, or different now, on a per-process granularity (changed by exec calls).

System-wide, you can disable the exec-shield functionality with:

	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield

If that doesn't make your binaries work, then you probably have a different
problem.  If it does, then the system-wide switch is a stop-gap you can use
while getting your binaries fixed.  We have also overloaded the inherited
"personality" setting so you can disable it per-process:

	setarch i386 foobar

That runs "foobar" with the "personality" bits set such that exec-shield is
disabled for that process and its children (unless one of them uses setarch
or is setuid or somesuch).  Again, if that doesn't make your binaries work,
then you probably have a different problem.

If disabling exec-shield momentarily does work around your problem, then
you want to figure out why you had to do that.  The most common situation
is that you were using executable stack in some way that you don't really
need to, e.g. GCC nested function trampolines.  You can avoid that by
rewriting the code not to use trampolines (i.e. take the address of a
nested function that uses its parent's local variables).  Things like Lisp
systems that produce executable code at run time should generally avoid
using stack space for that.  You also should not be using malloc or direct
brk/sbrk calls to get memory that you need to be executable--you have never
had a specified guarantee that malloc returns executable memory.  For
dynamic allocation of memory where you need to put executable code, use
mmap with PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC.  It is also fine to mmap with
different protections and then use mprotect with e.g. PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC
later.  It is not proper to call mprotect on memory returned by malloc,
because when you free that memory later it may be reused in ways that don't
require the executability.  The same goes for the brk area.  (It's also the
case that no specification guarantees that mprotect is meaningful on
malloc-returned space, though in fact it will also work as you expect on
malloc and brk/sbrk space in Linux and probably all Unixoid systems.)

If you have a genuine need for executable stack, you can put a marker in
your binary to tell the system that's what you want.  This marker goes in
ELF executables (and DSOs) as the PT_GNU_STACK phdr entry, with p_flags
containing PF_X to indicate need for executable stack and not containing
PF_X to indicate no need for executable stack.  I'll describe how to
compile those markers in a little later.  When a binary does not have any
PT_GNU_STACK marker at all, as is the case with binaries produced by all
older tool versions, it's treated as needing executable stack to be safe.
That should retain compatibility with older systems.

The story is the same for DSOs as for executable files.  The difference is
that while the kernel looks for the marker in executable files at exec
time, the dynamic linker looks at the marker in DSOs when it's loading
them.  This is because an executable file that itself does not require an
executable stack might load a DSO at runtime (either as a needed library or
by using dlopen, e.g. for plug-in libraries) that does require executable
stack.  In this instance, the dynamic linker stops and makes all the stacks
executable before completing the load of the DSO in question.  Note that
this support applies only to the stack--if a DSO dynamically allocates
memory it needs to be executable and does that the wrong way, no marker
will work around it, the code just has to be fixed.

If you have an old DSO binary that it's not feasible for you to rebuild for
some reason (e.g. 3rd-party plug-ins for your applications), you can try
marking it using the `execstack' utility (part of the `prelink' rpm).
execstack edits an existing ELF binary for you, either to add a
PT_GNU_STACK phdr if it's missing or to set or clear the PF_X flag.
`execstack -q FILE' will tell you the current status of that file: X for
executable, - for not, and ? for an old binary with no marker at all.  (You
can also use readelf -l or objdump -p to see the phdrs.)  Note that there
should never really be a need to add a marker to an old executable file
because of the compatibility default--a good thing, since execstack cannot
move things around to make room for the phdr in an executable as it can in
a DSO.  Remember, the default when there is no marking is to assume
executable stack is required for compatibility with older systems.  Ergo,
you don't need to add a marker if it would have PF_X set.  The reason to
add a marker is to avoid enabling executable stack at runtime when it's not
really needed.  

When compiling from source with current tools (including those in FC1), you
don't usually need to do anything special to get the right markers into
your binaries.  The way it works is that the linker produces the
PT_GNU_STACK marker when there are special marker sections in the input
object files, called ".note.GNU-stack".  The flags of these sections
determine the flags of the PT_GNU_STACK entry.  Your object files (.o) will
normally have these sections because GCC emits them in its assembler
output.  When GCC compiles nested function trampoline code, it emits a
.note.GNU-stack section with the SHF_EXECINSTR flag set:

	.section .note.GNU-stack, "x", @progbits
	.previous

When GCC compiles a module that does not contain any code requiring
executable stack, it emits the complementary marker section with no
SHF_EXECINSTR flag bit:

	.section .note.GNU-stack, "", @progbits
	.previous

If you have assembly code of your own, then you need to add these markers.
The best way is to amend the source code with one of the assembly
directives above.  If that is problematic for some reason, another thing
you can do is tell the assembler directly what to emit on the command line
using -Wa,--execstack or -Wa,--noexecstack.  Finally, if you want to punt
altogether on marking your .o files properly, you can tell the linker to
ignore the marker sections and override its output setting directly on the
command using -Wl,-z,execstack or -Wl,-z,noexecstack.


Thanks,
Roland

Just one other clarification:  GCL redefines malloc as a pathway
through its own sbrk-generated, gbc managed memory system.  Again,
don't see the relevance (yet) from the failuire as reported.

cd unixport && make raw_pre_gcl
gdb raw_pre_gcl
(gdb) r ./ <foo
(gdb) bt

The 'raw...' images are INTERMEDIATE in the makefiles and deleted
automatically. 

Also would be nice to see the gcc version.

Take care,

Hello François,

You should not need to be root to compile Axiom, unless you have
messed-up at one point when compiling Axiom under root account.

If you want to update your Axiom local CVS copy, you'd better use
command: 

   cvs -z6 update -dC

 -z6: compression
 -d: create new directories
 -C: delete files no longer in the repository

I hope it will be easier with this command.

> You write that Axiom sources are in tex files with explain.

I fear that having real documentation is really an intent right now. Tim
has focused on documenting the building process and part of the
interpreter when an issued was raised, but nothing systematic has been
done yet.

I _think_ you'll find part of the interpreter in src/interp/i-*.pamphlet
files. Maybe the toplevel handling is in i-toplev.boot.pamphlet.

I hope it helps a little,
Yours,
d.

My apologies too, for I haven't had the time to investigate beyond the 
obvious "It doesn't compile" stage.

Hello Paul,

Paul.Zimmermann@loria.fr (Paul Zimmermann) writes:

Thanks to friend in our local LUG, I have the following answers:

 - you'll find libbfd.a and libiberty.a in "libbinutils2-devel" packages;

 - GCL 2.5.3 exists as a Mandrake package:
http://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/linux/distributions/mandrake/9.2/contrib/SRPMS/gcl-2.5.3-1mdk.src.rpm

You could use for Axiom, look at the package to see the needed patches
for the Mandrake or call the package maintainer to see if he has
gcl-2.6.x in the pipe.

I hope it helps,
Yours,
d.

Soem of my Lisp code was (for a short while!) broken by Fedora because
malloc appears to stat allocating memort from 0xc0000000 downwards (is it
starts above the 2G mark, handing back negative addresses when you malloc
a big enough chunk) while RedHat 9.0 and earlier always returned positive
addresses. This may not be an issue for GCL and may not be the issue of
the day but I feed it is as a fedora difference... Arthur

Greetings!  Yes this will make a difference.  We need to set the macro
NULL_OR_ON_CSTACK correctly.  Check out the examples in h/*linux.h and
h/notcomp.h.  Also check out the configure detected C define CSTACK.

Hope this helps,

I further investigated problem using scheme-7.7.90 and found the
following. When loading a band (the runtime image), the following is
called:

static void *
mmap_heap_malloc_1 (unsigned long requested_length, int fixedp)
{
  unsigned long ps = (UX_getpagesize ());
  void * addr
    = (mmap (((void *) MMAP_BASE_ADDRESS),
	     (((requested_length + (ps - 1)) / ps) * ps),
	     (PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE),
	     (MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | (fixedp ? MAP_FIXED : 0)),
	     /* Ignored by GNU/Linux, required by FreeBSD and Solaris.  */
	     (-1),
	     0));
  return ((addr == MAP_FAILED) ? 0 : addr);
}

Now for the default runtime (runtime.com), requested_length == 5726028,
and the function proceeds without fault. However when the "-compiler"
switch is used to load the compiler, the all.com runtime is loaded and
then requested_length == 18563072 (this image is much bigger) and the
mmap call results in a segfault. ps is 4096, fixedp is 1 and
MMAP_BASE_ADDRESS == 4096.
Why does mmap segfault at all? Shouldn't it at worst return an error?

Hope this helps...

When MAP_FIXED is passed (fixedp!=0), the mapping will overwrite any other
mappings that exist.  So if the address range overlaps some shared
libraries or something like that, it will clobber that part of the address
space and who knows what could happen.  In older kernels, shared libraries
would always end up in a high part of the address space, so assuming a huge
low region was available worked.  Now shared libraries (and any mmap
region) are more likely to be located at random addresses that may be in
the low part of the address space.  It has never been safe or kosher to
assume some large part of the address space would never be used for shared
libraries.  cscheme needs to change its plan for calling mmap.  If you need
a big contiguous region of address space into which you will place multiple
separate mappings, then the only safe thing to do is to mmap a region of
the whole needed size without MAP_FIXED (e.g. using PROT_NONE), and then
overwrite portions of that mapping with MAP_FIXED mappings to get the
layout you want.


Thanks,
Roland

As pointed out in the corresponding fedora.us package request bug,
disabling exec-shield is not enough.

This is about Fedora Core 1 kernels (http://fedora.redhat.com), which have
some changes to how mapping addresses are chosen.

I can't speak to that vintage of Linux libc or Linux kernels.  The
specification of mmap has always been that MAP_FIXED overwrites other mmap
mappings, and in no recent time have shared libraries been anything other
than mmap mappings.

If you want a Linux-specific kludge, you can always see the complete memory
map by looking at /proc/self/maps.  If you want a portable programmatic
solution correct for POSIX systems with mmap, the only kind of probing you
can do is try large mmaps without MAP_FIXED and see where they fit.

I see.

> of this space

I don't think you should have to.  Your address space is yours to control.
You just haven't been exercising control in the specified proper ways.

> Faced with this situation, I'll probably just statically link the
> program.

Support for static linking is severely limited in a variety of ways.
If you make any but the most low-level use of system library facilities,
static linking is almost certainly a recipe for future aggravation.

> IMO it's a bug that the application doesn't have any control over its
> address space.  

The application has complete control over its address space within the size
limits provided by the kernel (3GB with most Linux kernels, 4GB-16MB with
some FC1 kernels).  Presumption of what addresses the kernel will use in
cases where the specification says it may choose any address, is not an
aspect of the control interface.

I'm not sure what level of control you have in mind when you distinguish
what you can specify to the linker and to the loader, or whether by "the
loader" you mean the kernel's loading of executable files, or the dynamic
linker's loading of DSOs, or both.  I don't see why it's not sufficient to
specify the layout you want at link time.  That you can do.  If your
executable contains PT_LOAD program header entries for each region you want
reserved, it will be.  You can use entries with none of PF_[RWX] set to get
PROT_NONE mappings that you can overwrite later with MAP_FIXED mappings.

> So why does the kernel care where shared libraries are mapped?  Why is
> the application working for the kernel instead of the other way around?

You are misrepresenting reality.  The kernel does not care.  You specified
that you did not care, and so the kernel is doing what it thinks might be
best for you given the constraints you have specified.

libc provides elf.h, yes.  The details are part of the ELF spec, available
online from e.g. http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/.  Looking at the phdr
entries in programs with readelf -l or objdump -p, their meaning is
probably obvious.  What you are probably interested in is how to control
their generation by the linker.  You will need to provide your own variant
of the normal built-in link script used to link an executable, that uses
the PHDRS directive explicitly lay out sections.  Here is the usual script
from `ld --verbose' for i386-*-linux-gnu hacked to add a leading load
segment at 0 for the ".reserved" section.  You'll have to give the linker
an input section of that name, e.g. with:

	.section ".reserved","a",@nobits
	.space 0x4000000
	.previous

to set the size of the output segment.


OUTPUT_FORMAT("elf32-i386", "elf32-i386",
	      "elf32-i386")
OUTPUT_ARCH(i386)
ENTRY(_start)

If I do:

  echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield

the GCL build succeeds. 
If I do:

  echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield

the GCL build fails.

   Hello Paul,

   Thanks to friend in our local LUG, I have the following answers:

    - you'll find libbfd.a and libiberty.a in "libbinutils2-devel" packages;

Thanks David. I installed libbinutils2-devel-2.13.90.0.18-3mdk.i586.rpm
and now I can go a little further in the "make" (complete log below):

% make

Any idea why the saved_pre_gcl command was not created?

Hmm, that's a new failure mode. If I remember correctly your laptop

Greetings!  OK, Tim now we're getting somewhere!  Thanks for all the
previous messages -- I will go through them, but it is not obvious to
me (yet) which of these messages are relevant.  It would be very nice
to get that gdb backtrace of the raw_pre_gcl segfault.  I can only
guess from what I've read so far that sbrk is not provding a
contiguous memory space or some such.  To come up with a solution, we
need to know what call GCL is making is failing.  We know the why
(exec-shield), but not the what.

If you can get me ssh access to the machine you're working on, I might
be able to take a look.

Take care,

Camm,

I tried 
 cd unixport && make raw_pre_gcl

and it says:
 make: *** No rule to make target `raw_pre_gcl'. Stop.

I read the makefile and 'tis true.

Unfortunately my Fedora system is heavily firewalled and on
a non-routing subnet so it can't be reached from where you are.

Tim

Sounds likely.  What is this?  We make heavy use of sbrk.

Can't see how executability could result in the reported failure.  My
bet is on the above.

Does this only effect PROT_EXEC settings on memory pages?  If so, then
Tim's results indicate that I am wrong, in which case I'd like to
understand where executable maps matter in GCL at the stage of the
reported failure.

This at least could function as a work-around for now, if we can make
configure figure out when it is needed (cat
/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield && [ -x setarch ] ?)  If this is the
wisest solution, let me know and I'll protect the image creations with
this command.

To my knowledge, we have no nested functions, nor rely on an
executable C stack.

We get all pages via sbrk, and redefine malloc to a call to a native
memory management system which in turn calls sbrk as needed.  If an
executable lisp object is loaded into one of these pages, the pages
are explicitly mprotected with PROT_EXEC.  The reported failure is
well in advance of this stage.

This is probably not an issue with us, as we only effectively use
sbrk, and the pages are never freed.  We do on occasion re-mprotected
previously mprotected pages, e.g. when setting a gbc write barrier
with the call (si::sgc-on t).

As stated above, I can't see where we would need this, though its nice

Would be interesting to check if a raw_pre_gcl compiled on an older
system would run on this new exec-shield kernel.

So even with nested functions, code should compile and run from
source, right?  Further indication that executable stack is likely not
relevant.

We don't use any asm.

Thank you for this very intersting and informative note!  I'll keep it
for future reference.

Hi Tim!

Is this in the same tree which you configured with --enable-debug and
failed at the raw_pre_gcl -> saved_pre_gcl stage?

Here is the makefile rule:

grep raw makefile

saved_%:raw_% $(RSYM) init_%.lsp \
	$(PORTDIR)/raw_$*$(EXE) $(PORTDIR)/ -libdir $(GCLDIR)/ < foo
raw_%: lib%.a libgclp.a $(SYSTEM_OBJS) $(EXTRAS)
^^^^^^^^^^^
	$(CC) -o raw_$*$(EXE) $(filter %.o,$^) \
	rm -rf  saved_*$(EXE) raw_*$(EXE) *.o core a.out $(RSYM) \
.INTERMEDIATE: init_ansi_gcl.lsp.tmp init_gcl.lsp.tmp raw_gcl raw_ansi_gcl


You can also just look at the link command in the failed build output
and execute it manually.  Mine is for example:

gcc -o raw_pre_gcl  \
	-L.  -u __gmpn_toom3_mul_n -lpre_gcl -lm  -lgmp /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/3.3.2/../../../libbfd.a /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/3.3.2/../../../libiberty.a -lreadline -lncurses -lc -lgclp

'make raw_pre_gcl' in the unixport directory results in the above for
me, but only after configure and building in the o/ directory,
(i.e. at the point of your reported failure).  You need libpre_gcl.a
first of course, when can be explicity made with 'make libpre_gcl.a'.

Take care,

Camm,

I have that stanza also but still get the same failure from make.
It seems to me that make raw_pre_gcl should set %==pre_gcl and $*==pre_gcl
but it doesn't. I'll try the type-it-in path.

   Greetings!  If you could please post your full configure and build
   output, we might be able to figure out what is going on.

I already gave the build output in my previous post.
I thought the configure output would not be interesting for you,
but if you insist, here it is:

##############################################################################
norroy% ./configure

You must set your AXIOM and PATH variables. Type:

export AXIOM=/var/tmp/axiom/mnt/linux
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

To build the rest of the system type:

make

configure finished.
##############################################################################

Greetings,
Paul

OK, please lookup the detected C defines DBEGIN and PAGEWIDTH in
h/gclincl.h, and then figure out the value of page(p) according to
this macro definition:

((unsigned int)(((unsigned long)(((char *)(p))-DBEGIN)>>PAGEWIDTH)))


Please also do (at this point)

p heap_end
p holesize
p core_end

Take care,

Greetings!  I believe you are having problems building GCL, so I am
referring to the GCL configure and build output.  If this is reposted
elsewhere, a url would suffice.

Take care,

Hello Paul

I'm CC:-ing gcl-devel@ as your issue looks more a GCL issue than an
Axiom one: GCL is not yet compiled. ;)

Looking at your build, you have those strange warnings:
> sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
> config.status: creating windows/gcl.iss
> sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
> config.status: creating windows/gcl.ansi.iss
> sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
> config.status: creating windows/install.ansi.lsp
> sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
> config.status: creating windows/install.lsp
> sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
> config.status: creating h/gclincl.h

It might be the culprit. I've check in my own logs and I don't have such
warnings. What is the version of sed used on the Mandrake (sed
--version)? 

Could you get a copy of the file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed?

Yours,
d.

I kind of suspected that GCL's trouble might relate to brk randomization.
I avoided getting into these details in my first long message because I
wanted to post that write-up about the executability issues for general
reference, and not make it any more complicated than it already was.

Nope.  This disables the "exec-shield mode" for all new execs (for those
reading kernel sources at home, PF_RELOCEXEC in task_struct.flags).  Using
"setarch i386 foobar" disables the mode for the run of foobar and its
children; otherwise ELF execs have the mode enabled or disabled according
to the presence or absence of PT_GNU_STACK program headers as I've already
described in detail.  That mode enforces nonexecutability as I described
previously.  It also enables some other layout changes.  I'll describe them
after answering your other various questions about how to be sure what's what.

I would just check for setarch.  You don't really need to check for
/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield existing, though I suppose it doesn't hurt
since you shouldn't need to use setarch when exec-shield isn't there.

The failures are pretty obvious when that's the nature of the problem.
i.e., you will get a SIGSEGV with the PC value set to some address,
and you can look in /proc/PID/maps and see the region containing the PC is
not executable, and voila, you're sure that's the problem (or isn't).

> Are these utils in any (unstable) Debian packages?

The `execstack' program is only available as part of the prelink package by
Jakub Jelinek, in very recent versions of that package.  Off hand I don't
know what version of prelink, if any, is in Debian.  readelf and objdump
are part of binutils, and versions too old to know the PT_GNU_STACK magic
number just show you the number instead of the name (match up with <elf.h>
values), so you can still see what's going on.

> So even with nested functions, code should compile and run from

With current tools on FC1, yes.  You should always be able to tell by
examining the binaries with readelf/objdump/execstack how the tools marked
(or didn't mark) the binary.

> We don't use any asm.

In that case you can be pretty sure that executable stack per se is not the
problem unless you are using GCC nested functions and we have some tools bugs.

This is probably where your problem lies.  See below.  


I mentioned layout changes enabled by the exec-shield mode.  The first of
these is randomization of the addresses returned by mmap when not using the
MAP_FIXED flag bit and supplying 0 as the first argument rather than a
specific hint address.  It has always been the case that mmap is specified
to return unpredictable addresses when not given MAP_FIXED, and the
application cannot presume any particular choices will be made (the address
given in the first argument to mmap is a nonbinding suggestion).  In the
past, Linux kernels have always returned a very predictable sequence of
addresses.  In Fedora Core kernels, for processes in exec-shield mode, mmap
returns truly unpredictable addresses.  This affects programs that presume
what addresses their mmap calls will return, and those that presume what
addressses no mmap call will ever return.  Note that this includes the mmap
calls made by the dynamic linker to load shared libraries before any
library or application code gets control, and potentially even the kernel's
mapping of the dynamic linker itself done at exec.  So if you had your eye
on some particular part of the address space not directly mapped by your
executable, it might already be in use by the time you get a chance to look.

Incidentally, the mmap randomization is what broke MIT Scheme.  It presumed
that the low 64MB of the address space would never be used at all, and did
mmap with MAP_FIXED on addresses in that range that would overwrite other
mappings such as those for the shared library containing the mmap function
itself.  That's a case of presuming what addresses "anywhere" mmap calls
would rule out, when no such guarantee was ever part of the specification
of the system interface.  MIT Scheme really wants that particular part of
the address space for its data due to its pointer tagging implementation
(high tags).  The mmaps for shared libraries done before the Scheme runtime
gets control are now randomized and might very well impinge on the
[0,0x4000000) range.  The only proper way to reserve such a range is with a
PT_LOAD program header in the ELF executable, which can request a PROT_NONE
mapping to reserve the range (without consuming any disk or RAM) so that it
has carte blanche to overwrite that range with MAP_FIXED mappings later.
Unfortunately, getting that into your binary is a bit of a pain in the ass
futzing with linker scripts and bits of magic dust.  I posted some quick
examples that demonstrated it adequately for the MIT Scheme maintainer, but
that maintainer is rather more experienced than the average bear.  If you
need to make this happen, I'll be happy to help you figure out the magic.


The second layout change is what I suspect broke GCL.  It broke Emacs's
unexec as well.  Personally, I consider this change incorrect.  However, we
have not yet hashed out among the RH developers concerned with this area
what the resolution will be.  Moreover, I tend to think that anything
broken by it probably ought to be doing things differently in the long run.
Since the dawn of time, the "break area" in Unix has started immediately
after the executable's writable segment (i.e. after its .bss section) and
extended upward from there.  By "the break area", I mean the region of
memory starting at the address returned by sbrk the first time it's called
after an exec.  From the beginning of Unix until two weeks ago Wednesday,
the first `sbrk (0)' returned &end, the end of your .bss; increasing the
break with sbrk calls gave a contiguous region from your data segment
through to the current address of the dynamically-extended break.  In
Fedora Core kernels, for processes in exec-shield mode, this is no longer
the case.  The starting address of the break area is randomized at exec
time, in a fashion similar to the randomization of mmap addresses.  The
first call to `sbrk (0)' will tell you the lower bound of the region, which
will not be lined up with the end of your executable's writable segment.
As always, calls to sbrk to increase the size of the region will work as
long as there is unused address space above the current break region
(randomly placed mmaps will tend to be elsewhere, lower in the address
space, and not impinge on break expansion).  But the exact location of the
region is now somewhat unpredictable, and you can always expect a hole
between static data (your program's writable segment, i.e. .data+.bss) and
the dynamically-extended break region.

As I said, I personally don't like this change.  That's because I consider
starting at &end to have been part of the specification of the break
functionality inherited from ancient Unix, and breaking such things is just
plain wrong.  Nonetheless it is at least for the moment the way things are
in FC1 kernels.  I don't want to engage in a discussion here about the
merits of this change.  I would like to help hash out how precisely it
affects you and any possible ways to work around it there might be.  (If
figuring it all out turns out to lead you not to want to change anything
and instead to complain heartily about the kernel behavior change, then
that's as may be.)

I said that anything broken by it probably ought to be doing things
differently.  The reason I say that is that I consider the brk interface
obsolete.  I can't really see any good reason to be using it in preference
to the other options.  It's inherently limited as an allocation interface
in that it provides just one contiguous region; address space fragmentation
from the mappings for the executable, shared libraries, thread stacks, etc,
will mean that many smaller discontiguous holes are available, and using
only the break region will mean the total limit on useful allocation in the
process can be much lower than the true limit imposed by the configured
resource limits, the system implementation, or available virtual memory
resources.  The other option to use mmap and be prepared to get
discontiguous regions when requesting pages on separate occasions.  If
contiguity is required, you can use the mremap call when available (AFAIK
only on Linux kernels) to extend a region and move it if a sufficient
contiguous region is not free in the original location.  If contiguity is
only somewhat preferred but not strongly so, you can use a nonzero first
argument to mmap (without using the MAP_FIXED flag), and you will
ordinarily get the requested address or the next following address with a
free region of the requested size.  (But note that there is still no
guarantee of getting the requested region without MAP_FIXED and the robust
program must be prepared to handle discontiguous regions.  FC1 kernels will
in fact hand back predictable addresses, but future kernels might not
always do so.)

If you specifically rely on treating static data and the dynamic break
region as a single contiguous region, something has to change.  If you
don't rely on that, but just on knowing the start and end of the contiguous
break region itself, then you can make the simple and portable change of
using sbrk (0) instead of &end to initialize your idea of the lower bound
of the break region.  In the long run, I would still recommend more drastic
changes to avoid relying on a contiguous break region at all, for the
reasons I gave in the previous paragraph.  If you make those changes, you
will not impose so low a limit on the total memory you can allocate in a
process, a benefit you'll get in the same way on all modern Unix-like
systems (at least the 32-bit ones, I guess 64-bit systems always have more
unused address space after the break than you could possibly need).

Please let me know if there is anything I clarify or anything I can do to
help you figure out what changes to your program might be best.

Ummm, I've read this 3 times and I understand that lisp (in fact every
lisp I've ever worked on) will break in this model. Lisp systems depend
on managing memory. 

If I understand what you wrote it appears that in the worst case I
could get back a page at a time which could not be remapped into a
contiguous area! Please tell me that I'm wrong.

I've written a couple garbage collecting memory managers and I can
tell you that, while I could write code to manage lists of single-page
memory pools, it would be horribly inefficient.  If, in the worst
case, I can only guarantee a page of memory at a time I'll be forced
to simulate page tables and play pointer games.

It appears that exec-shield has taken a "master-slave" relationship with
the application. The master does what it wants, unpredictably so, and
every application has to cope.

This will be my first, last, and only bitch about this but I claim that
exec-shield is broken by design and should be withdrawn. It is correct
by legal definition and wrong by philosophy. The point of a computer is
the application. Randomizing the behavior of the operating system means
that every application programmer will have to defend against the 
operating system. It is true that correct code will always work but 
any slight misunderstanding by the application programmer will lead
to random, non-repeatable crashes. This will give Linux a reputation
for being unreliable.

Sorry if this sounds aggressive. I'm just used to 30+ years of a
certain memory models and I don't deeply understand the implications
of this change. It appears to be an attempt to "fix" bad programmers
code vulnerabilities. However, it then goes on to assume that the
same programmers can code rock-solid legal code under all possible
random results. 




So, now that I'm thru the denial and grief, lets move on to the coping
phase....



Do you have a set of examples from the design to show me what expectations
will be violated? I read your text but it would be helpful to see actual
code that used to work and will no longer be guaranteed to work. Is there
a design document I can read to understand this better?

Lisp needs large contiguous areas to be efficient and, given that I
can now address gigabytes worth of memory there ought to be a way to
guarantee that I'll get them. Clearly allocating from &end to the top
of memory won't work.

What I'd like to achieve is allocating all of available memory above 
the loaded code as one contiguous block. I can then manage all of the
memory myself. Can you comment on these potential ideas?

Is there a way to get a map all of addressable memory? Such a map could
tell me that the shared library(s) sit in ranges of my address space.
I could then route around the damage by allocating them as fixed lisp
objects that the garbage collector can't move. Alternatively we could
just copy the shared library out of the way and dynamically relink the
library calls.

Another strategy is to statically link everything. That way &end upward
will be unused. But I got a hint from your previous note that something
is about to break with static linking. How will static linking change?

Another strategy is to allocate really large data areas in the 
executable. 

Is there a way to access the page tables? I can remap the pages in the
address space so the shared libraries are contiguous with the end of
my code within my address space, freeing up the rest of memory as a
contiguous block.

If all else fails can I allocate memory a page at a time, looping until
memory is exhausted, and then compute the memory map? This appears to
let me unrandomize the brk calls.


I guess the key question boils down to: how do I allocate very large
contiguous blocks of memory reliably in the new memory model?

Bingo.  In fact, we use exactly emacs' unexec.  I'm hoping your past
tense of the verb to break here indicates that a fix for unexec is
already at hand?

I've verified that this is where the segfault is, and if I understand

Thankfully, GCL does not have to know precisely where its heap lower
bound is (apart from unexec) until the first call to sbrk(0) is made,
but we do absolutely need contiguity of this heap.  As long as you
don't dump brk altogether, I may retain my head of hair. :-).  We do
approximate this lower bound at compile time with a C define called
DBEGIN, but this is truncated to such a large unit that the
randomization does not cause problems, mostly.  There is some
probability that the DBEGIN determined at configure time even when
truncated is *greater* than the address returned by the first call to
sbrk(0), a definite no-no.  I'm sure we can work up some heuristic to
come up with a true lower bound for the range of randomized sbrk
addresses.

I'm not really sure how much memory could be wasted, but this likely
seems a very small consideration compared to the complexity of
redesigning the garbage collector, etc.  GCL has static arrays of
length MAXPAGES used to mark various properties of the pages as they
are allocated, which in turn is indirected via a function of the
address and DBEGIN.

Your comments are quite helpful.  It seems like if we can

1) fix unexec and 
2) come up with a configure time absolute lower bound to the first
sbrk after exec

we're gold.  Else we must

3) use setarch

You are overreacting.  You have quite a lot of control over your address
space.  It's just that "presume it will be like it usually has been" does
not constitute control.  You have to use the proper explicit mechanisms.

I don't really know what you are referring to.  Unless you have already
loaded zillions of libraries or other randomized mmaps, most of your
address space will be free.  If you want a 1GB chunk, mmap a 1GB chunk
first thing.  You know that the address space is 3GB or more and you've
decided that 1GB is enough because it makes it easier to only handle one
contiguous and that's the size you can reasonably expect, then fine.

If you want to be absolutely sure of a certain minimum size before any
shared libraries are loaded, then you need to have a PT_LOAD program header
in your executable requesting a specific mapping.  This is equivalent to
allocating a huge data area in the executable, but you can do it without
making the region accessible before your explicit mappings, and without
consuming any real RAM or disk for it.  I explained this already.

There is a POSIX specification of what has been guaranteed and what has
always unspecified implementation detail you should never have been relying
on.  You have never been able to presume the layout mmap will use, or how
close to the break it might be.  However, you can reasonably expect that
any implementation of decent quality would endeavor make it possible to get
contiguous mappings of both small and large sizes.  The locations of small
mappings such as those for the shared libraries are not predictable, but
they do not create ludicrous amounts of fragmentation.

I suppose I am overreacting and I apologize. I just don't see the 
advantage of fragmenting contiguous memory randomly. It is trivial
to set up hardware page tables to map shared libraries into contiguous
space. What is the rational for such random behavior?

Not exactly.  I do plan to resolve the situation in the Fedora Core 2
development cycle, but exactly how is not yet clear.  I'd like to
understand GCL's constraints as well as Emacs's before deciding what to do.

Do you make many repeated sbrk calls to expand the heap?  If you make just
one big allocation and don't really care what the base address is, then
mmap is just as good for you.  However, it sounds like you want to choose
the actual address range at compile time.  Is that so?

> Only in unexec.  If emacs has a fix, we can use it directly.

But, in the binary produced by unexec, do you rely on the _end/end and
_edata/edata symbols beind adjusted to included brk data allocated by the
loadup run before the unexec?  (I haven't yet checked whether Emacs does.)
That is, if what unexec did were to just restore some particular memory
allocated in the first run, disjoint from the original data segment, would
that make you happy?

> I'm not really sure how much memory could be wasted, but this likely
> seems a very small consideration compared to the complexity of

Sure.  Contiguity is inherently limited in the ways I mentioned, but there
are plenty of reasons to like it if those limitations aren't your primary
concern.  If you like contiguity, you just need to find the best ways to
ask up front for all the contiguity you really need.

> 2) come up with a configure time absolute lower bound to the first
> sbrk after exec

That is not something you ought to try to rely on in the current situation.
It is in fact a known range at the moment, but if the brk randomization
feature remains, you can't be sure the range will remain the same, or that
a compile-time determination would apply correctly to running on slightly
different kernels or different hardware configurations.

> Else we must

> 3) use setarch

This is certainly the right stop-gap solution if you are concerned about
people building GCL on FC1 tomorrow.  It's trivial to implement in the src
rpm spec, and probably not worth putting in configure now since it likely
won't be required for very long.


Thanks,
Roland

   Hello Paul

   I'm CC:-ing gcl-devel@ as your issue looks more a GCL issue than an
   Axiom one: GCL is not yet compiled. ;)

   Looking at your build, you have those strange warnings:
   > sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
   > config.status: creating windows/gcl.iss
   > sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
   > config.status: creating windows/gcl.ansi.iss
   > sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
   > config.status: creating windows/install.ansi.lsp
   > sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
   > config.status: creating windows/install.lsp
   > sed: file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed line 32: Unterminated `s' command
   > config.status: creating h/gclincl.h

   It might be the culprit. I've check in my own logs and I don't have such
   warnings. What is the version of sed used on the Mandrake (sed
   --version)? 

Mandrake 9.0 contains sed 3.02. I've installed version 4.0.7 but it does
not seem to solve the problem.

   Could you get a copy of the file /tmp/csMec4jd/subs-1.sed?

Unfortunately it was removed by "make". Is there a way to keep temporary
files when an error occurs?

Paul

I'm also using sed 3.02 on my old debian stable, so the issue is not
there.

Yes, add a special target in the Makefile:

.PRECIOUS: %.sed

   Yes, add a special target in the Makefile:

   .PRECIOUS: %.sed

In which Makefile? I tried both the main Makefile, lsp/Makefile,
lsp/gcl-2.6.1/makefile, but the last one is re-generated by the main "make", 
so this new target is lost.

If I put --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd in the gcl configure
(file lsp/Makefile, line 37), as suggested by Camm Maguire, the 'sed'
problem disappears, but another problem appears:

Yes.  This is to keep images from becoming unnecessarily large -- we
expand the heap just enough to hold the working code.

In short, at this moment, we just need a coarse floor to the heap
start at compile time.  We don't need to specify it, just to know what
it is.  There may be a relatively simple modification possible in
which we could forgo this compile time step in favor of a runtime
initialized static variable.

GCL uses several statically defined arrays to hold marking and type
information on the pages in the heap -- statically defined to separate
them from GCL's memory management system.  So basically all GCL needs
to my knowledge is some reliable way to map the elements of these
arrays to the pages in the heap.  Right now, this mapping is done by
running a little test in configure to get an idea of where sbrk will
start, and then taking its floor against some large divisor.  A DBEGIN
constant is compiled in, which on i386 Linux is currently 0x8000000.
A given heap page address is then mapped to the static array element
by subtracting this value, and rightshifting by the (log) PAGEWIDTH
(>>12). Even though sbrk will commence some pages above DBEGIN, this
is not critical, but will merely waste some initial elements in the
array. So the random start of sbrk, as long as it is above DBEGIN,
will merely waste a few more such elements, and reduce the actual
amount of heap allocatable somewhat further.

This extra 'heap wasteage' will be, alas, not a one time event in
typical GCL usage.  Applications built on GCL usually go through
several cycles of compile and load, save(unexec), restart new image,
compile and load, etc.  With each iteration, there will be a hole
introduced into the heap (presumably sbrk will in no circumstances
return an address below the existing .data section end).  GCL should
still continue to function, if I understand correctly.  How big is the
random sbrk range?  Could be quite small if one just wants to achieve
protection from attacks, no?

The modification I referred to above would be to skip the compile time
test, define DBEGIN as some static variable, and set this to the first
sbrk.  I think the windows port might already do something like this.
This would eliminate the first hole in the heap, as well as the
possibility of negative array offsets due to the skewing of the
compile-time and runtime sbrk.  It will not prevent subsequent holes
introduced through the typical development cycle mentioned above.
Right now I *think* we could survive this, but we won't know for sure
until all GCL built software is thoroughly tested.

The only place I can possibly imagine this would be used is in
subsequent unexec's.  I.e. a load,save,restart,load,save,restart  must
contain the contents of the first load as well as the second.  If
unexec uses some other algorithm to achieve this, I don't think GCL
cares about _end and _edata (though I'd need to double check to be
certain.)

See above.  Disjoint should be workable, though a bit wasteful, as
long as we never lose old pages in multiple cycles.

The linker script sounds interesting, though a bit complex.  Does the

We may be able to change this at runtime as mentioned above.  At very

Tim, I'd like to know what your feelings/time horizons are.  I'm
thinking the best thing for GCL in general is to replace DBEGIN with a
runtime variable in any case if that does not break anything, and in
addition, offer a configure option
--enable-i-dont-want-holes-in-my-heap which will invoke setarch on
each created image.  (Would unexec preserve the effects of setarch?).
Then we wait for an unexec fix from our trusty friends at redhat. In
the meantime, the above configure option is mandatory.  Thoughts?

Take care,

Dear Camm,

   From: Camm Maguire <camm@enhanced.com>
   Date: 19 Nov 2003 09:35:16 -0500

   Greetings, and thanks as always for your helpful reports!

   As you know by now, axiom starts by building GCL.  I cannot tell from
   the log you've posted whether this stage has been completed or not.

Clearly the problem happens during the GCL configure (i.e. 
before GCL is built).

   It is most helpful for me (as a GCL developer) to see output from the
   GCL ./configure stage through the creation of
   lsp/gcl-2.6.1/unixport/saved_gcl.  

   The sed commands are issued by configure, not make, as they make the
   "make" related files and headers from the corresponding ".in"
   files. The "unterminated sed command" indicates that one of the
   variables configure tried to determine automatically has been
   corrupted, usually by capturing stray puctuation characters.  With
   great probability, this is the step trying to determine where your
   static bfd and iberty libs are kept.  This is normally
   /usr/lib/libbfd.a and /usr/lib/libiberty.a.  configure tries to
   determing this by creating a dummy foo.c file:

   echo 'int main() {bfd_init();bfd_openr("/dev/null",0);return 0;}'
     >foo.c

   and then parsing the output of

   gcc -Wl,-M -static -o foo.o foo.c -lbfd -liberty

   to see where gcc found the libs.  This command is run through:

   2>&1 | tr '()' '\012\012' | $AWK '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq

   in 2.6.1-18.  I've recently added for the utexas people an additional
   filter: 

   2>&1 | grep -v : | tr '()' '\012\012' | $AWK '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq

   If you wanted, you could change the line in configure.in to look like
   the above, run autoconf, and then ./configure in the gcl-2.6.1
   directory and see if the "unterminated sed" message vanishes.
   Alternatively, you can make the foo.c, run the gcc command, pipe it
   though your existing filter, and let me know the results.  We can then
   get this to work automatically on Mandrake.

One problem is that when I run ./configure in gcl-2.6.1, it works...
but it does not when called by the main Axiom "make" (file
lsp/Makefile) so it is not only a gcl problem...

I modified lsp/Makefile so that it does not extract gcl-2.6.1.tgz,
thus does not override gcl-2.6.1/configure.in, and copied the file
$tmp/subs-$ac_sed_frag.sed in /tmp/toto.sed before sed -f was called.
The culprit is the following:

[...]
s,@ECHO_T@,,;t t
s,@LIBS@, -lm  ../libbfd.a
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../../../libbfd.a /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../../../libiberty.a -lreadline -lncurses,;t t
s,@VERSION@,2.6.1,;t t
[...]

When I compiled the above foo.c, I get:

norroy% gcc -Wl,-M -static -o foo.o foo.c -lbfd -liberty
Archive member included because of file (symbol)

/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../../../libbfd.a(init.o)
                              /tmp/cc6jJptq.o (bfd_init)
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../../../libbfd.a(opncls.o)
                              /tmp/cc6jJptq.o (bfd_openr)
... (and so on)

(No need to say the grep -v patch does not work.)

When the configure is started as "stand-alone" from lsp/gcl-2.6.1,
the config.status does not contain ../libbfd.a:

[...]
s,@ECHO_T@,,;t t
s,@LIBS@, -lm  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../../../libbfd.a /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../../../libiberty.a -lreadline -lncurses,;t t
s,@VERSION@,2.6.1,;t t
[...]

Investigating a little further, it seems that when called from the Axiom make,
there is a mess in the output of gcc -Wl,-M -static -o foo.o foo.c -lbfd 
-liberty, which makes you think that "../libbfd.a" is a valid path:

[...]
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux-gnu/3.2/../..//usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc
../libbfd.a(archive64.o)
[...]

This seems to be a gcc bug (should flush stderr before calling ld).
Does not seem easy to provide a workaround...

Hope it helps,
Paul

Why won't the addition of the grep -v : to the filter weed this out?

GCL has its own local copy of bfd for situations like these.  It
should not be relied upon, as it is seldomly updated, but it can get
you going in a pinch.  It sounds as though your local binutils build
went smoothly, but I cannot tell from this report.  More output please
:-).

Take care,

Camm,

It's a good news, bad news day.

The two items of good news are that I have a running version of Axiom
on Red Flag Linux, the chinese version of Linux. Fortunately one of
my students is Chinese and can read the menus.

The second good news item is that I've built a Mandrake machine and
I'm about to test Paul's problem.

The bad news is that the build failed on the Xeon port.

Note the line that reads:
make[4]: *** Warning: File `gcl_cmpbind.lsp' has modification time in the future (2003-11-20 05:18:38 > 2003-11-20 05:18:37)

I'm going to play with this build a bit more to see what I can learn
before the evening is out.

Tim

I'll try the /tmp and let you know the results.

re: ARM. awesome. really awesome. i can't wait to try it.

Greetings!  Hi Tim!  Thankfully a simple fix.

1) These xeons are just regular 32bit x86 cpu's with sse2 extensions,
   I think.  No 64bit -- am I wrong?

2) You must be compiling across NFS with a clock skew between server
   and client.  gcl_arraylib.lsp was successfully compiled to
   gcl_arraylib.c and gck_arraylib.data, the former of which passed
   through gcc to produce the head of gcl_arraylib.o, and the latter
   of which was appended to gcl_arraylib.o as is typical in GCL
   produced compiled lisp objects.  By the time unixport/saved_gcl was
   to be made, gcl_arraylib.c was deemed newer than gcl_arraylib.o,
   leading to a recompile via gcc without any append of
   gcl_arraylib.data, and to the load error you see on saved_gcl
   initialization.  Why not just copy the tree to /tmp if you can't
   control the clock and build there?  Or I suppose we could put in
   some makefile safeguards against this sort of thing in our
   lsp/makefile.

3) BTW, thanks to Phil Blundel, I have an ARM axiom .deb build running
   through its final tests as we speak.  I compiled it against a gcl
   configured with --enable-debug in case something went wrong, so
   this build may be a bit slower than what we finally end up with,
   but nothing did, and I anticipate full C optimization will not pose
   a problem.  The autobuilders just didn't have a long enough timeout
   on this box to get past the expexpand compile, which took some 5.5
   hours without optimzation, and is known to be >2.5 hours at least
   with full optimization.  I'll try to put in some mechanism to
   generate artificial output at some interval in the next Debian
   package release.

Take care,

Greetings!

http://people.debian.org/~camm/axiom_0.0.0cvs-11_arm.deb

Enjoy!  

I'm going to redo the build with -g -O3 just to make sure we can
survive gcc optimization, then release a new package for the
autobuilders with a keep-alive mechanism.

Take care,

David,

I've succeeded in building Axiom on Red Flag Linux, the chinese distro.
Please update the faq page to include this.

I want to upload binaries and have the faq point at them.
I'm open to suggestion about how to organize this.

Tim

*,

I've been reading about your Fedora project. As I understand it the
project is an effort to create a digital repository architecture.

I'm the lead developer on Axiom, a large, general purpose computer algebra
system. Axiom has been rebuilt from the ground up to use literate programming.
That is, the system is now able to mix research and technical papers with
runnable code. Every file in the system is now a TeX document and C, lisp,
boot, Makefiles, and algebra code are all dynamically extracted during build.

We're designing the new Axiom system with a 30-year planning horizon. 
Thus we are looking for ways to support Computational Mathematics as
a separate discipline. Clearly we need to incorporate ways to integrate
multimedia as well as research papers, algorithm descriptions, and
executable code into some well thought out platform. For teaching
purposes we should be able to interact with net-based resources like
MIT's Open Courseware (ocw.mit.edu) project.

Your project offers an interesting look at a possible back-end architecture
for Axiom. We could consider subsuming all of the literate programming, 
current compiled objects, and databases into a Fedora repository as well
as research and video lectures.

If one of you feel this is an interesting idea I'd like to have a phone 
conversation to discuss possible directions. Please contact me at:

Hi,

I've just tried to compile the current CVS version of AXIOM, but the
build failed pretty early at this point:

 echo "ECHO start %1\lib\gcl-2.5.0\unixport\saved_gcl.exe -dir %1\lib\gcl-2.5.0\unixport -libdir %1\lib\gcl-2.5.0 -eval \"(setq si::*allow-gzipped-file* t)\" %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 >> gcli.bat" ) > /usr/local/src/axiom-current/lsp/gcl-2.6.1/bin/gclfinal.bat ; fi
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/axiom-current/lsp/gcl-2.6.1'
(cd xbin ; cp ../bin/gcl .)
cd cmpnew && make gcl_collectfn.o
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/axiom-current/lsp/gcl-2.6.1/cmpnew'

make[1]: ../unixport/saved_pre_gcl: Command not found
make[1]: *** [gcl_collectfn.o] Error 127

I have no idea how to fix this. :-( 

Any pointers?

Peter

Peter,

I'm not sure what failed from the information you provided.
It looks like you've checked axiom out of CVS into /usr/local/src
and then did a 

  mv axiom axiom-current

Your axiom variable should look like:

  export AXIOM=/usr/local/src/axiom-current/mnt/linux

What is the current setting?

I unpacked the .deb and hand-copied the files because there was not
enough space on my CF card. I managed to wedge Axiom onto the card
but it segfaults.

Do you have a lisp image that runs on the ARM?

While clearing out a cupboard, one of my colleagues came across a
handful of copies of Jenks & Sutor.  If anybody on this list would like
one then please send me your snail mail address and we'll ship it to you
wherever you are, even if its the Netherlands :-) [1]  First come, first

Cheers, Mike.

 >   export AXIOM=/usr/local/src/axiom-current/mnt/linux

That is exactly what it's set to. I just tried it again, but got the
same error. I complete build log is available here

    http://peti.cryp.to/axiom-build-log

in case that helps. Maybe my gcc version 3.3.2 is a bit too new for
axiom's taste? The failure line in the configure output seems to
suggest that.

Thanks for the quick reply!

Peter

I've looked at your log on:

    http://peti.cryp.to/axiom-build-log


You're not even getting to the Axiom build.

saved_pre_gcl does not seem to exist during the lisp build.
I've copied the gcl-devel people. I'll look at my build up to that
point and get back to you.

Tim

   Rebuild, making sure you don't wipe out your changes by a fresh gcl
   unpack from tar.gz.

   This patch in in CVS and will appear in the forthcoming 2.6.1-19.

2) If this doesn't work, change the gcl configure command by adding
   the following options:

        --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd

Please let me know if problems persist.

Take care,

Greetings!

Phil, just to fill you in, thanks to your help, we've built axiom for
arm with full debugging (I'm rebuilding with optimization now).  We're
trying to run it on a Zaurus.

When I first read this, I thought it was due to a missing mprotect
functionality in your kernel, which is used by GCL's stratified
garbage collection facility to mark and maintain read-only pages.  But
our arm build has this turned off (historically for some reason I
could not get it to work), so something else must be going on.  

Tim, thankfully you could run the AXIOMsys binary under gdb to see
where the segfault is, if you can get gdb onto your small system.
That should clear up what's going on quickly.

I'm cc'ing Phil as he might have some experience in running arm
binaries on the Zaurus.  If I recall, there are several arm binary
formats -- are they all compatible?

Take care,

If gdb itself won't fit, you should be able to use gdbserver to debug
remotely.  I've found this useful for tracking down problems on ipaqs
and zauruses in the past.

Yes, this should be fine.  The only issues might be around glibc
versions (and C++, but from what I gather you aren't using that).

This did. Thanks! I also noticed GCL doesn't like the stack protection
features the Propolice-GCC inserts; I had to disable them to compile
GCL successfully. Maybe that's something the configure script might
want to test as well? After all, Propolice is getting very popular
these days.

As for Axiom: The build succeeds to build GCL but fails then:

Is this the same as exec-shield?  I've written a proposal on this to
Tim and Roland from Fedora, and will try to do something when I get
their feedback.

Take care,

Hi Tim,

I'm from the Cornell side of the project.  If you would like to talk we
could set up phone call some time next week.  I'm also copying Chris
Wilper who is our lead developer.  I'd like to include him too if he is
available.

Let me know times that would work, and I'll compare schedules.

- Sandy

Bernard,

> Congratulations for the release.

Thanks. It has been a team effort.

> I have done some testings with ledit axiom to have a readline interface
> and it seems to work correctly.

Actually, if you look at src/clef you'll see a program that we use 
instead of readline, called clef. It was developed under modified bsd
so it can be used with any program. It follows the usual X11 xterm style
of options where -e is the last option and specifies the program to run:

  clef -e yourprogram

This will add readline-like ability to the program. It copies stdin,
stdout, and stderr and then manages the connections. It intercepts
special characters like uparrow. It does not handle Ctrl-p (emacs)
kind of characters but it wouldn't be hard to add.

I'd be happy to work with GIAC to find some common ground between our
efforts. I'll download GIAC and look at it.

I can barely fit parts of Axiom on the unit at the moment. I'll look
for a Compact Flash 256 card so I can get some room to install gdb.

Camm,

I've just ordered a Lindows computer from Walmart. I'm going to set it
up as part of a compile farm in my basement. I'll make the Fedora box
you were using available as well as other distros. I figure I can buy
a computer every couple months and add it to the network. That way we
can have stable test machines for each distro. At $200/machine it
seems reasonable to host the machines locally. That way I can install
whatever we need. Once I get the box and get it set up I'll figure out
how to give people access. 

Tim

Just wondering: how far from completion is the task of releasing the
LaTex files of the book? As I remember from earlier mailing list
posts, Tim was rapidly working through the text to bring the LaTeX
code up to modern standards, while incorporating updates.

re: book

Several things have happened to slow down my progress. At the moment
the book is now all in pamphlet format, it has a new "technical
introduction" section written by Martin Dunstan, and a new section
on writing compiled code (which may not make the first release).

Ignoring the outside factors progress has slowed a bit because it takes
a long time to read and re-read 700+ pages and edit it for content. 
I have two long-ish vacation times coming up (thanksgiving and christmas)
which will greatly increase my progress.

There are several things I'd like to experiment with (e.g. embedded
active graphics using ADVI) but those can wait until the first version
is in CVS.

There is motion, nearly every day. It just isn't visible yet.

Tim

Thanks. It hadn't been mentioned on the list for a while, prompting me
to inquire.

No, I don't think so. My system uses the Gentoo
hardened-gcc [1], which includes the patches for creating
ET_DYN binaries [2] and Propolice [3]. The latter technique
has been developed by IBM; more information about it is
available at [4].

Camm, I now have the room to install libgmp but the /lib directory is
in ROM it seems. I've installed it in /home/zaurus/lib and am trying
to use LIB_PATH to point to it. Life interrupted the task but I'll 
try it today.

Hello Tim,

Done. Have you specific information about the compilation, like the
machine it was compiled on or the release of Red Flag Linux?

I think the most simple is to put binaries in the download area of
savannah and make the web pages point to them (with a link towards
spcific directories like
http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/axiom/algebra_depends.pkg/1.0.0/). 

Now, if you ask how to organize the various directories, I would advise
for the usual division linux-distros/release/specific-arch (like
RedHat/8.0/i386). 

Regarding the web page, we can do whatever we (you) want. Like for
example sorting binaries by distro, arch or releases.

BTW, Tim, if you make source package or binaries, try to avoid putting
uneeded parts, like two different releases of GCL or ADVI. End-user may
be resource constrained.

Yours,
d.

no prob. There are several code paths in progress in various parallel
directories that will eventually complete. I hate vaporware and try
not to pre-announce things that don't work (at least on MY machine :-) ).

I could take this approach but don't plan to. It adds more overhead to
the task and I'm changing things every day. Telling people that "here
is the book" but don't believe what you read won't work. Telling them
"here is the book" but don't try this at home won't work (that's what
the book is for). Telling them "here is the book" will generate a raft
of corrections, some of which I've already made. Telling them "here is
the book" but don't send me corrections eliminates the great value-add
of sharing it.

I understand. Mike Dewar has said he has 6 free copies available. Send him
a note and hope. I looked at the current cost for used versions on Amazon 
and it is running about $48 a copy. (Sure is a shame I don't get royalties :-)).

It's coming. Like Axiom itself, it is a larger task than I expected. 
As Torvolds said about Linux "It's late. I'm always late".

Strange. It seems that the bootsys is triggering the error.

Can you launch manually
/usr/local/src/axiom-current/obj/linux/bin/bootsys?

Have you any idea where "Error 137" comes from? Is this error message
Gentoo specific?

Yours,
d.

David,

I have 4 different tar.gz files from 4 different builds that I'll upload.
One of the 4 is Red Flag Linux.

> Done. Have you specific information about the compilation, like the
> machine it was compiled on or the release of Red Flag Linux?

Red Flag 4.0 is the version. If there are any other identifying marks
I can't read them :-)

That's a normal shell failure code from /bin/sh. Gentoo is
not involved in the build at all, I'm building this manually
after checking-out the source code from CVS. 

My system _is_ tricky, because I'm running SELinux (the NSA
variant) with the PaX stack protection code from Grsecurity.
Plus, I'm running the very latest gcc with special stack
protection features patched in. So it's quite normal for
compilations to fail on my machine, as you can imagine. :-)

Still I think that Axiom _should_ build fine on such a
set-up, because it really shouldn't be bothered by how the
compiler lays out its stack frame! GCL seems to be another
issue, though.

Anyway, my point is, that I would really like to get this
fixed. :-) If there is anything I can do to help, please let
me know. I can give you guys an account on my machine, if
that helps.

Peter


P. S.: I'm running the binary snapshot for Debian right now,
which works (after I disabled stack protection for its
binary).

Peter,

I searched Google for "make 'Error 137'" and it appears to be related
to a missing library in every case.


There is a magic shell variable to get loader debugging information:

 export LD_DEBUG=all

be aware that you'll get a LOT of output on every command (including ls).
I've never seen this documented anywhere. If that doesn't give you a clue
then unset this variable, rerun the make, and send me the console log.

Tim

Peter,

The depsys image is just a lisp image with a few files loaded.
It may be that the "unexec" failed. That is, I believe, the system
call that lisp uses to do save-system. We've had unexec problems
with Fedora, the new RedHat version because they have a new "security"
wrinkle called exec-shield. 

A lisp image strongly cares about its stack. Odds are that you can't
save an image.

If lisp exists try this:

cd (yourpath)/obj/linux/bin

./lisp
> (system::save-system "foo")       <= this will exit lisp

./foo
>

If you don't get the second prompt then you probably can't save lisp
images. Either way, let us know what happens.

Tim

Just tried it and got exactly the same prompt, when running
./foo. The save-system call seems to work here.

Peter,

Do you have a "/usr/lib/tk8.3" subdirectory?
And do you have libtk8.3.so?

I am currently reading the code to see what it expects but 
my best guess is that it is trying to build lisp and link
to something in tk8

I'm checking further....

Tim

Peter,

Don't do a make clean.

Do the following:

cd /usr/local/src/axiom-current          <== (yourpath)
cd lsp                                   <== where lisp lives
edit Makefile                            <== Axiom's Makefile, not the .pamphlet
modify line 35 from:                     <== where we specify gcl options

	./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-statsysbfd --enable-readline --enable-maxpage=128*1024 ; \

to read:                                 <== add two options

	./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-statsysbfd --disable-tclconfig --disable-tkconfig --enable-readline --enable-maxpage=128*1024 ; \

(note that the I've added "--disable-tclconfig --disable-tkconfig")

save the file                            <== 
cd ..                                    <== back to axiom-current
rm obj/linux/bin/lisp                    <== remove the broken lisp
rm lsp/gcldir                            <== force lisp to be rebuilt
make                                     <== restart the build process

This change should skip the gcl tcl build completely.
That should bypass the problem.
Save the console again in case it fails.

I'll make option changes on the configure easier.

Tim

No, I didn't have TCL/TK installed. I added both (albeit
never versions) and re-compiled, but it doesn't seem to
affect the outcome of the build much:

    http://peti.cryp.to/axiom-build-log

By the way: Can I somehow specify a flag _always_ to be used
when compiling a C file? I set CFLAGS, but that seems to
affect only "most" of the compilations.

Since I had added "--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd"
already -- to fix the gcl build in the first place --, the
configure call now reads

    ./configure --enable-vssize=65536*2 --disable-statsysbfd
        --enable-locbfd --enable-maxpage=128*1024
        --disable-tclconfig --disable-tkconfig
        --enable-readline ;

on my machine. (The "--enable-readline" was new as well, by
the way.)

I rebuilt with these changes, but it doesn't seem to do much
difference. The output is available at:

    http://peti.cryp.to/axiom-build-log

Camm,

Peter's build seems to be failing loading tkl.o
(see http://peti.cryp.to/axiom-build-log) look for '[all] Error 137'

I tried setting --disable-tclconfig --disable-tkconfig

but the error still occurs. Suggestions?

Tim

Camm,

Close but no cigar...

/mnt/cf/usr/lib/axiom-0.0.0cvs/bin/AXIOMsys: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3' not found (required by /mnt/cf/usr/lib/axiom-0.0.0cvs/bin/AXIOMsys)
/mnt/cf/usr/lib/axiom-0.0.0cvs/bin/AXIOMsys: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3' not found (required by /mnt/cf/usr/lib/axiom-0.0.0cvs/bin/AXIOMsys)

by the way, how did AXIOMsys end up under /lib?

Development of this is quite hard as I'm partially color blind and
there doesn't seem to be a way to turn off ANSI color on the terminal.
Thus I can't read some of the words. I rewrote termcap but made no
difference.

As you suggested, either a chroot environment (which could be on a CF
card), or specifying an alternative libc.so using LD_LIBRARY_PATH, would
be the easiest way to get up and running quickly.

Alternatively, it would be possible to replace the OS on the device with
one of the images from openzaurus.org.  I believe some of their later
releases are using glibc 2.3 and gcc 3.3, just like Debian unstable,
though you'd have to check with the openzaurus guys to find out for
sure.

Alright, I finally managed to compile Axiom and the problem
described above turned out to be what disturbed the build
process all along. Here is how to fix it:

 1) Build ET_EXEC binaries by adding 
     
        -yet_exec -yno_propolice

    to CFLAGS. Instead of "-yno_propolice" the flag
    "-fno-stack-protector" might also work, but should be
    more portable. The patched GCC identifies itself as
    follows:

        peti:/usr/local/src/axiom-current# gcc --version | head -1
        gcc (GCC) 3.3.2 20031022 (Gentoo Linux 3.3.2-r2, propolice)

    Generally, if the compiler understands the
    -fstack-protector flag, it's an indication that these
    patches are active.

 2) Disable the stack protection features in the kernel
    (PaX) for the compiled binaries with chpax(1). For
    example:
    
        chpax -pEmrxs unixport/saved_gcl

    This command must be executed right after the binary has
    been linked. If the binary is used before the chpax
    call, the process will be killed:

        Nov 24 03:55:30 peti PAX: terminating task:
            /usr/local/[...]/gcl-2.6.1/unixport/saved_gcl(saved_gcl):1297,
            uid/euid: 1000/1000, PC: 085e7b00, SP: 5f3ed5ac

    And that is what disturbed the build process all the
    time. (BTW: On some platforms chpax can be called by
    root only; thus it would be best to make the exact shell
    command configurable by a make variable, such as CHPAX,
    so that people can set this to "sudo chpax" or
    something.)


Tim, there is one more problem: When I run
${AXIOM}/bin/axiom, clef returns the following error and
terminates:

    clef trying to get terminal initial settings: Bad file descriptor
    peti:/usr/local/src/axiom-current$ dup2 0 failed: Bad file descriptor
    dup2 1 failed: Bad file descriptor
    dup2 2 failed: Bad file descriptor
    clef trying to dup2: Bad file descriptor

Peter,

Clef is a readline-like program that enables arrow key handling.
You can run Axiom without this by typing:

  AXIOMsys

Yes, that works fine; thanks for the hint. Any idea what
this clef problem might be about? And how to fix it?

Clef relies on BSD style stream handling, I believe.
All it really does is copy stdin, stdout, and stderr.
It looks like that doesn't work on your machine.
There isn't much to the program. If you know how to use gdb
it would be useful to see a traceback.

Greetings!  Glad to hear you've got it working.  If you are interested
and have the time, and can propose a way in which GCL can work with
these security modifications with minimal disruption to the goals of
each, this would be very helpful.  Please bear in mind though that it
could be some considerable time before we could put in any substantial
modifications, though simple ones are plausible in the short term. 

I'm not sure, but from your reports it seems as if the kernel is
detecting that code is being executed from the data section, and
killing the process with -9.  There is a rather non-optimal workaround
at present if this is the case, and that is to build with dlopen as
the linker and loader. (--disable-statsysbfd --enable-dlopen).  A few
minor patches to the axiom source are also required for this (and can
be found in the Debian axiom source package in debian/patch.*).  This
is used at the moment in porting axiom to Debian alpha, ia64,
mips(el), and hppa.  This method also has the known limitation that
the build of the axiom databases will exceed the maximum number of
open files needed for dlopen.  Tim has put in a workaround to avoid
building the databases in such cases, but from GCL's vantage point,
we'd love to be able to free ourselves from dlopen and issues like
this. 

Take care,

For anyone serious about Axiom, I highly recommend
getting a copy of this book! I tried via Amazon but
failed. Thank you again, Tim for sending me a copy.

Although it may not be quite up to date, I don't think
you will notice much difference if you main interest
is in the mathematics. The description of the user
interface is a little out of date (or not yet released
as part of Open Axiom), but that shouldn't be a
problem.

This document contains all the information you need

    http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-x86-install.xml

including a link to the download mirrors. You can download
the "Gentoo Live CD", for instance, to boot a machine into
Gentoo from the CDROM without installing it.

Note, though, that the problems I had with building Axiom
are related to a very special installation, which uses PaX
and the hardened-gcc. Normal Gentoo systems won't have these
and thus won't reproduce the problems I have had. More
information about that topic is available at:

    http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/

HTH,

Peter

Unfortunately, I cannot use GDB on my machine (because of
the security features). So I can't help with that.

But I wonder whether it would be hard to add libreadline
support into Axiom? That's definitely the best solution to
console line editing for Unix systems, I'd say. If I find
the time, I'll look into that and submit a patch.

First of all, though, I must do some math. Axiom is great,
by the way. :-)

Looking at the code in edible.c I found that the server number is required for

I didn't build from scratch; I only copied the new and recently changed files

Some hints from the Fedora Core mailing list about making programs 
run under exec-shield.

all 'third party' apps will run with exec-shield disabled by default.

_Iff_ a package is recompiled under Fedora (using Fedora's gcc and
binutils) then you might end up with an app that has exec-shield enabled
although the app itself for whatever reason has some executability
assumption.

In this case there are myriads of ways to make the app work again:

 - use 'setarch i386 <app>' [or rather, use the 'i386 <app>' shortcut]

 - add this gcc option to the CFLAGS in the Makefile:

	-Wa,--execstack

 - add the following oneliner anywhere in the app's source in an assembly
   file to disable exec-shield:

	.section .note.GNU-stack, "x", @progbits; .previous

 - disable exec-shield globally, put "kernel.exec-shield = 0" into 
   /etc/sysctl.conf.

 - the preferred solution: fix the app itself to not assume executability
   of non-executable regions or not hardcode any VM properties such as
   'mmaps start at 2 GB'. Both assumptions are illegal and these apps will
   likely break on 64-bit architectures too, so they should be fixed. Note
   that typically the changes needed are quite simple.

in any case, please keep reporting apps that need an executable stack, we
want to track them all down and fix them for good. Fortunately 99.9% of
the 5000+ binaries in a full Fedora Core 1 install work out of box.

note that there are also prelink related problems, which we want to know
about and fix just as much, but which should not be confused with
exec-shield problems. Sometimes these do get mixed up.

(in any case, please also read the extensive description provided by
Roland McGrath's "exec-shield mmap & brk randomization" email.)

	Ingo

Michel,

The 'axiom' command runs a program called 'clef' which provides
readline-like functions for the arrow keys. It seems that there
is an issue on some platforms. I'll look into the issue tonight.

You can run axiom directly by typing:

AXIOMsys

Hi

I am using "regular" gentoo on 2.6 kernel have succed to build it 3
weeks ago.

I will try to build it again this week to check. I can even try to write
an ebuild for it( kind of package more like a script explaining how to
get the source, how to compile install ect acording to some policy)

Antoine,

I'm looking for ISO images because none of my systems are
connected to the internet so I can't do network installs.

I found a few issues with the October 31st binary release of Axiom.
Maybe some result from false usage.  I would very much appreciate any
hints, fixes or explanations for these messages.


1) In my understanding, fist class values should be assignable like this:

(1) -> x:Type==Integer
                                                                   Type:
Void
(2) -> x
   Compiling body of rule x to compute value of type Domain


   >> System error:
   Caught fatal error [memory may be damaged]

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(2) ->



2) According to a list of features I found on the net, the normal
   distribution should be numerically invertable. So why does this not work?

(3) -> numeric(erf(0.0))

   (3)  0.0
                                                                  Type:
Float
(4) -> numeric(erf(0.1))

   >> Error detected within library code:
   Can only compute the numerical value of a constant, real-valued
Expression

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(4) ->



3) This one compiles with aldor and similar syntax is used in the
   $AXIOM/src/algebra/*.spad files. So what's wrong with it?

(1) -> MyCat:Cateroy == with { new: ()->% }
   Internal Error
   Unexpected error in call to system function pf2Sex1

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(1) ->



Thank you very much for any answers

Stefan

Stefan,

The first two work fine on the latest version. The binaries must
necessarily trail the CVS version because it takes a long time
(sometimes days) to recompile a full Axiom not to mention the
lag of uploading/downloading binaries.

The third example (there is a typo Cateroy should be Category)
does fail and should be added to the bug list. The interpreter
uses a different parser than the compiler. 

You can correctly compile this code by making a file (say, f.spad) thus:

)abbrev category MYCAT MyCat
MyCat:Category == with { new: ()->% }

The system needs the ")abbrev" line.
Then do:

  )co f.spad

Stefan,

I lied. The second expression:

  numeric(erf(0.1))

also fails. I'll list it as a bug but I'm not sure it is. The code 
considers this a known error and complains about it:

   Can only compute the numerical value of a constant, real-valued Expression

I'm not familiar with erf so I'll have to read the code and look up the
mathematical function definition.

Dear All,

	just to keep things going. I downloaded teh new binaries of
TeXmacs 1.0.2.8 which was assumed to work 'out of the box` according to
Joris, but didn't. In fact, everything behaves as it was, no progress, and
no functioning AXIOM session in TeXmacs on SuSE (for me by now).

	I am puzzled still ....

   Why won't the addition of the grep -v : to the filter weed this out?

No idea...

I'm trying to build and package Axiom as rpm
for ALT Linux distro (www.altlinux.org) and it
seems that I found some subtle bug.

Build process stops pretty quickly with the
following error message
=================================================

Fast links are on: do (si::use-fast-links nil) for debugging
Error signalled by LOAD-A-FILE.
Broken at LOAD.  Type :H for Help.
===================================================
Take a look at vmlisp.lisp file name with full
path - it's all lowercase while actual path name
has .../RPM/BUILD/... in upper case.  The reason is
pretty clear - file names in makdep.lisp are
represented as symbols not as strings.  So lisp
converts them all to one case.  It works as long
as path consist of lowercase characters only
and fails otherwise.  In general I think that
keeping filenames as symbols is not a wise
practice and should be avoided.

Best wishes,

Vadim

Hello,

I don't remember if some of you had this issue but after Tim changed the
source tree (to distinguish between Axiom's noweb and system's noweb),
it was no longer possible to do a 'make' in the root directory, with an
error message like '..../mnt/linux/bin/notangle: file not found'. The
solution is to do a 'make nowebclean' before doing a new
'make'. nowebclean targets reases noweb tools, thus at next make they
will be rebuild and the build system will find its notangle.

Yours,
d.

Hello Tim,

I know that you are offline this weekend, but there is no hurry to reply
to this email, we have a 30 years time frame. :)

I reconsidered what you said at the end of August about pamphlets:
http://mail.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-08/msg00071.html

When you describe View 1, top-to-bottom path, and View 2, side-to-side
path, you say you want to respectively descend abstraction levels and
stay at the same abstraction levels.

It raises for me the following question: how would you define a given
"abstraction level"?

For some levels, this is easy and can be deduced from the kind of source
code: Spad, Boot or Common Lisp (and even C if you want to dig into GCL
internals and GMP). However, within for example Spad code, I'm sure you
would like to define some intermediate levels. How would you define
them? From Spad language syntax (domains, categories, operations and
their implementations, ...)? From properties of domains (all domains
having the '*' operator)? From a combination of both (all domains
inheriting from Ring and having the '**' operator)? Would you need a
kind of query language on Axiom's algebra to write properties that would
define a given abstraction level? Something else?

If you have some example or further explanation, it would propably light
up some candles in my brain. For example, could you give a very short
overview of a top-to-bottom example?

Yours,
d.

Dear Vadim,

as far as I know, AXIOM should be compiled in a directory with *lower

checked this on my SuSE 8.0 and failed to compile with UPERcase pathnames
but succeeded with lower case path-names ...

hope this helps

Exactly. This is a known bug and a fix has been proposed by Juergen but
is not integrated yet in the main source tree:

Hello Bertfried,

To check, I've just downloaded and compiled TeXmacs 1.0.2.9 and it works
for me with latest CVS Axiom (besides a small bug in the texmacs shell
script, but this can be easily solved ($prefix and $exec_prefix are
apparently not substituted).

I could no test with version 1.0.2.8, but as far as I know, the axiom
plugin in TeXmacs has not been modified between .8 and .9.

If you are able to execute AXIOMsys, from the same terminal you starts
'texmacs', then you probably have a path issue or a shell script issue.

What is the content of your PATH env variable? 

And of your AXIOM env variable? 

Where is located your AXIOMsys binary?

Where is located your texmacs binary?


Yours,
d.

PS : To compare, my setting:

david@oops:~/Installed/TeXmacs-1.2.0.9/bin$ echo $PATH
/home/david/pub/axiom-libre/axiom-i386/axiom/mnt/linux/bin:/home/david/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games

david@oops:~$ echo $AXIOM
/home/david/pub/axiom-libre/axiom-i386/axiom/mnt/linux

david@oops:~/Installed/TeXmacs-1.2.0.9/bin$ which AXIOMsys
/home/david/pub/axiom-libre/axiom-i386/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys


I execute texmacs with command:
david@oops:~$ ~/Installed/TeXmacs-1.2.0.9/bin/texmacs

I don't understand what you have said. You meant that above code can
compile in a file (f.spad) but does not compiled in the interpreter? Is
this the bug?


In the interpreter:

Thanks.  I already realized that.  Symbol-named files are loaded
in many places and load-a-file function from util.lsp converts
all these file names to lowercase strings.

I really think that this is quite nasty bug/feature since
it prevents from packaging Axiom for any rpm based
Linux distro since default rpm build directories are always
uppercase.

Thanks one again,

Vadim

Dear David,

my environment and path variables are:

%> which AXIOM sys
/home/fauser/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys

%> which texmacs
/usr/local/TeXmacs-1.0.2.8/bin/texmacs

%> env | grep AXIOM
AXIOM=/home/fauser/axiom/mnt/linux/bin

> echo $PATH
/usr/local/TeXmacs-1.0.2.8/bin:/home/fauser/axiom/mnt/linux/bin:/usr/local/aldor/bin: \
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/bin:/usr/games:/opt/gnome/bin:/opt/kde3/bin:/ \
opt/kde2/bin:/usr/lib/java/bin:/opt/gnome/bin:/opt/pilotsdk/bin

hence everything looks quite fine for me. Since the texmacs binary is in
my path, I execute it via
%> texmacs

no clue what to to, I'll give a try on TeXmacs-1.0.2.9 ... hmmm

cheers and many thanks for your effort to help me ;-)
BF.

Hello Bertfried,

1. To avoid possible issues, could you make a try with following minimal
   PATH?

PATH=/usr/local/TeXmacs-1.0.2.8/bin:/home/fauser/axiom/mnt/linux/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/bin
export PATH

And even remove /usr/X11R6/bin if TeXmacs can execute without it.

With above PATH, have you the same AXIOMsys and texmacs (which ...)?


2. Could you send me (by private email), the content of the
   /usr/local/TeXmacs-1.2.0.8/share/TeXmacs/plugins/axiom/ directory (as
   a .tar.gz)?

Can you also send me the result of:

strings /usr/local/TeXmacs-1.2.0.8/libexec/TeXmacs/bin/tm_axiom

I just want to check that the AXIOMsys binary is correctly called.


Yours,
d.

Hello Tim,

I have investigated the clef issue and made a patch that makes clef work
(at least on my Debian linux machine). The patch is against latest CVS.

In fact, most of lib/ and clef/ code was not compiled because the
makefiles did not use the ${CCF} compile flags, so LINUXplatform was not
defined, so no code was compiled for openpty() and related code. :)

I have also modified the etc/axiom shell script and corresponding
Makefile to:

 - use explicitely /bin/sh

 - separate definition of AXIOM and its export

 - use clef on systems we know it works (right now, only linux)


Yours,
d.

Dear Tim,

	after noticing that my TeXmacs problem might be based on a
malfunctioning AXIOMsys, I downloaded the cvs source and tried to build
AXIOM (as I did earlier)

a) I exported the AXIOM variable, but make failed since the directory
../mnt/linux/bin was not present

2) I mkdir'ed these two directories, but got another error

make: *** [all] Error 3

which I was not able to resolve. Hence I failed to compile a new AXIOM :-(

(will try to download on a faster line the compiled version, but would
like to be able to build the system. A previous build worked without
problems (over night))

cheers
BF.

David,

I'm currently working on a demonstration pamphlet based on the paper called
Primes is in P. I'm hoping to finish it and present it at a workshop in
Italy next week. It is an ideal example of working from the theory all
the way down to the code. I have to get permission from the authors to
publish the paper, however, so the pamphlet form won't see general 
distribution until that happens. Except for lacking Axiom code the paper
is pretty close to a complete example.

You can see the original paper, which starts out with the theory and
explains the algorithm here:

http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/primality.pdf

If you look at the algorithm description it is pretty close to actual
code. The paper is not only a mathematical proof it is nearly a
proven program. They show loop termination. 

Besides revealing an interesting mathematical fact they seem to have
established what I would consider a landmark paper from a Computational
Mathematics point of view.

Tim

Hello Bertfried,

I am sorry that I have been quiet for so long - too much
work for which people pay me, as opposed to things I
really like to do ... <grin>

A quick question about the problem you mention below:

  Did you follow *exactly* the instruction to set
  the paths which you receive when you first start
  by cd to your new Axiom route directory and typing
  the command

  ./configure

  ??

Your output below suggests that (perhaps) the AXIOM
environment variable was not set correctly.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

PS. When I get around to it (real soon) I plan to
install SuSE 8.2 on one of my machines and I will see
if I can reproduce your problems or find a solution.

David,

Yes, the code can compile from a file.
No, the code cannot be compiled from the interpreter.
Is this a bug?

ummm, yes, no, maybe? Yes, in theory the interpreter should accept
the function and compile it. No, the interpreter won't accept the
function and compile it. Maybe that's a bug or it's a design flaw.
The problem is that the compiler and the interpreter have different
parsers. Since they have different goals they have different constraints.
So unifying the two parsers is not a simple problem. I'll look at the
specific error but I'm not certain what the fix will be.

Please add it as a bug so it doesn't get lost.

Tim
