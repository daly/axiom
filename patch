    "C++ templates are key to the design of current successful mainstream
    libraries and systems. They are the basis of programming techniques in
    diverse areas ranging from conventional general-purpose programming to
    software for safety-critical embedded systems. Current work on improving
    templates focuses on the notion of {\sl concepts} (a type system for
    templates), which promises significantly improved error diagnostics and
    increased expressive power such as concept-based overloading and function
    template partial specialization. This paper presents C++ templates with
    an emphasis on problems related to separate compilation. We consider the
    problem of how to express concepts in a precise way that is simple enough
    to be usable by ordinary programmers. In doing so, we expose a few
    weaknesses of the current specification of the C++ standard library and
    suggest a far more precise and complete specification. We also present
    a systematic way of translating our proposed concept definitions, based
    on use-patterns rather than function signatures, into constraint sets
    that can serve as convenient basis for concept checking in a compiler.",
