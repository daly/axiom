    "An algorithm is developed to compute the complete CS decomposition
    (CSD) of a partitioned unitary matrix. Although the existence of the
    CSD has been recognized since 1977, prior algorithms compute only a
    reduced version (the 2-by-1 CSD) that is equivalent to two
    simultaneous singular value decompositions. The algorithm presented
    here computes the complete 2-by-2 CSD, which requires the simultaneous
    diagonalization of all four blocks of a unitary matrix partitioned
    into a 2-by-2 block structure. The algorithm appears to be the only
    fully specified algorithm available. The computation occurs in two
    phases. In the first phase, the unitary matrix is reduced to
    bidiagonal block form, as described by Sutton and Edelman. In the
    second phase, the blocks are simultaneously diagonalized using
    techniques from bidiagonal SVD algorithms of Golub, Kahan, and
    Demmel. The algorithm has a number of desirable numerical features."
