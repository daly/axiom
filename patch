    about general-purpose symbolic software is followed by general

    code. The theoretical background including modeling techniques for
    mechanical systems is provided which allows for the computer aided
    generation of the symbolic equation of motion for multibody
    systems. It is shown how the governing equations for different types
    of problems in structural mechanics can be automatically derived and
    how to implement finite element techniques via computer algebra
    software. Perturbation methods as a very powerful approach for
    nonlinear problems are discussed in detail and are demonstrated for a
    number of applications. The applications covered in this book
    represent some of the most advanced topics in the rapidly growing
    field of research on symbolic computation."

    "Scratchpad [GrJe71] was a computer algebra system developed in the
    early 1970s.  Like M\&M (Maple [CGG91ab] and Mathematical [W01S92]) and
    other systems today, Scratchpad had one principal representation for
    mathematical formulae based on ``expression trees''.  Its user interface
    design was based on a pattern-matching paradigm with infinite rewrite-
    rule semantics, providing what we believe to be the most natural
    paradigm for interactive symbolic problem solving.  Like M\&M, however,
    user programs were interpreted, often resulting in poor performance
    relative to similar facilities coded in standard programming languages
    such as FORTRAN and C.  
    
    Scratchpad development stopped in 1976 giving way to a new system
    design ([JenR79], [JeTr81]) that evolved into AXIOM [JeSu92].
    AXIOM has a strongly-typed programming language for building a library
    of parameterized types and algorithms, and a type-inferencing
    interpreter that accesses the library and can build any of an infinite
    number of types for interactive use.
    
    We suggest that the addition of an expression tree type to AXIOM can
    allow users to operate with the same freedom and convenience of
    untyped systems without giving up the expressive power and run-time
    efficiency provided by the type system.  We also present a design that
    supports a multiplicity of programming styles, from the Scratchpad
    pattern-matching paradigm to functional programming to more
    conventional procedural programming.  The resulting design seems to us
    to combine the best features of Scratchpad with current AXIOM and to
    offer a most attractive, flexible, and user-friendly environment for
    interactive problem solving.
    
    Section 2 is a discussion of design issues contrasting AXIOM with
    other symbolic systems.  Sections 3 and 4 is an assessment of AXIOM’s
    current design for building libraries and interactive use.  Section 5
    describes a new interface design for AXIOM, its resulting paradigms,
    and its underlying semantic model.  Section 6 compares this work with
    others."

    Two languages are defined, one total and one partial, with identical
    syntax. The semantics of the partial language includes partial and
    infinite values, and all types are lifted, including the function
    spaces. A partial equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the
    domain of which is the total subset of the partial language. For types
    not containing function spaces the PER relates equal values, and
    functions are related if they map related values to related values.

    It is proved that if two closed terms have the same semantics in the
    total language, then they have related semantics in the partial
    language. It is also shown that the PER gives rise to a bicartesian

    order-sorted algebra and category theory to ensure that operations are
    only applied to expressions when they ``make sense''.

    In cases where Axiom uses notions which are not covered by current
    mathematics we shall present new mathematics which will allow us to
    prove that all such cases are reducible to cases covered by the
    current theory. On the other hand, we shall also point out all the
    cases where Axiom deviates undesirably from the mathematical ideal.
    Furthermore we shall propose solutions to these deviations.

    Strongly typed systems (especially of mathematics) become unusable
    unless the system can change the type in a way a user expects. We wish
    any change expected by a user to be automated, ``natural'', and
    unique. ``Coercions'' are normally viewed as ``natural type changing
    maps''. This thesis shall rigorously define the word ``coercion'' in
    the context of computer algebra systems.

    We shall list some assumptions so that we may prove new results so
    that all coercions are unique. This concept is called ``coherence''.

    We shall give an algorithm for automatically creating all coercions in
    type system which adheres to a set of assumptions. We shall prove that
    this is an algorithm and that it always returns a coercion when one
    exists. Finally, we present a demonstration implementation of this

    This thesis presents an algorithm for computing (one-sided) limits
    within a symbolic manipulation system. Computing limtis is an
    important facility, as limits are used both by other functions such as
    the definite integrator and to get directly some qualitative
    information about a given function.

    The algorithm we present is very compact, easy to understand and easy
    to implement. It overcomes the cancellation problem other algorithms
    suffer from. These goals were achieved using a uniform method, namely
    by expanding the whole function into a series in terms of its most
    rapidly varying subexpression instead of a recursive bottom up
    expansion of the function. In the latter approach exact error terms
    have to be kept with each approximation in order to resolve the
    cancellation problem, and this may lead to an intermediate expression
    swell. Our algorithm avoids this problem and is thus suited to be
    implemented in a symbolic manipulation system."

    "Sophus Lie (1842-1899) pioneered the study of continuous
    transformation groups that leave systems of differential equations
    invariant.  Lie’s work [l-3] brought diverse and ad hoc integration
    methods for solving special classes of differential equations under a
    common conceptual umbrella.  Indeed, Lie’s infinitesimal
    transformation method provides a widely applicable technique to find
    closed form solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODES).
    Standard solution methods for first-order or linear ODES can be
    characterized in terms of symmetries.  Through the group
    classification of ODES, Lie succeeded in identifying all ODES that can
    either be reduced to lower-order ones or be completely integrated via
    group theoretic techniques.  
    
    Applied to partial differential equations (PDEs), Lie’s method [2]
    leads to group-invariant solutions and conservation laws.  Exploiting
    the symmetries of PDEs, new solutions can be derived from known ones,
    and PDEs can be classified into equivalence classes.  Furthermore,
    group-invariant solutions obtained via Lie’s approach may provide
    insight into the physical models themselves, and explicit solutions
    can serve as benchmarks in the design, accuracy testing, and
    comparison of numerical algorithms.
    
    Nowadays, the concept of symmetry plays a key role in the study and
    development of mathematics and physics.  Indeed, the theory of Lie
    groups and Lie algebras is applied to diverse fields of mathematics
    including differential geometry, algebraic topology, bifurcation
    theory, to name a few.  Lie’s original ideas greatly influenced the
    study of physically important systems of differential equations in
    classical and quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, and many
    other applied areas [4-81].
    
    The application of Lie group methods to concrete physical systems
    involves tedious computations.  Even the calculation of the
    continuous symmetry group of a modest system of differential equations
    is prone to errors, if done with pencil and paper.  Computer algebra
    systems (CAS) such as Mathematica, MACSYMA, Maple, REDUCE, AXIOM and
    MuPAD are extremely useful for such computations.  Symbolic packages
    [9-11], written in the language of these GAS, can find the determining
    equations of the Lie symmetry group.  The most sophisticated packages
    then reduce these into an equivalent but more suitable system,
    subsequently solve that system in closed form, and go on to calculate
    the infinitesimal generators that span the Lie algebra of symmetries.
    
    In Section 2, we discuss methods and algorithms used in the
    computation of Lie symmetries.  We address the computation of
    determining systems, their reduction to standard form, solution
    techniques, and the computation of the size of the symmetry group.
    In Section 3, we look beyond Lie-point symmetries, addressing contact
    and generalized symmetries, as well as nonclassical or conditional
    symmetries.  
    
    Section 4 is devoted to a review of modern Lie symmetry
    programs, classified according to the underlying CAS.  The review
    focuses on Lie symmetry software for classical Lie-point symmetries,
    contact (or dynamical), generalized (or Lie-Backlund) symmetries,
    nonclassical (or conditional) symmetries.  Most of these packages were
    written in the last decade.  Researchers interested in details about
    pioneering work should consult [9,10,12].  In Section 5, two examples
    illustrate results that can be obtained with Lie symmetry software.
    In Section 6 we draw some conclusions.  
    
    Lack of space forces us to give only a few key references for the Lie
    symmetry packages.  A comprehensive survey of the literature devoted
    to theoretical as well as computational aspects of Lie symmetries,
    with over 300 references, can be found elsewhere [11]."

    that they implement. An educator needs to consider which topics to
    cover in a course on cryptography as well as how to present the
    concepts and techniques to be covered in the course. This thesis
    contributes to the field of cryptography pedagogy by discussing and
    implementing small-scale cryptosystems whose encryption and
    decryption processes can be stepped through by hand. Our
    implementation has been accepted and integrated into the code base of
    the computer algebra system Sage. As Sage is free and open source,
    students and educators of cryptology need not worry about paying
    license fees in order to use Sage, but can instead concentrate on
    exploring cryptography using Sage’s built-in support for cryptography."
