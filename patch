    We assume some standard choices for the branch cuts of a group of
    functions and consider the problem of then calculating the branch cuts
    of expressions involving those functions. Typical examples include the
    addition formulae for inverse trigonometric functions. Understanding
    these cuts is essential for working with the single-valued
    counterparts, the common approach to encoding multi-valued functions
    in computer algebra systems. While the defining choices are usually
    simple (typically portions of either the real or imaginary axes) the
    cuts induced by the expression may be surprisingly complicated. We
    have made explicit and implemented techniques for calculating the cuts
    in the computer algebra programme Maple. We discuss the issues raised,
    classifying the different cuts produced. The techniques have been
    gathered in the BranchCuts package, along with tools for visualising
    the cuts. The package is included in Maple 17 as part of the
    FunctionAdvisor tool."
