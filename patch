    "There is a large ecosystem of mathematical software systems. 
    Individually, these are optimized for particular domains and
    functionalities, and together they cover many needs of practical and
    theoretical mathematics. However, each system specializes on one area,
    and it remains very difficult to solve problems that need to involve
    multiple systems. Some integrations exist, but the are ad-hoc and have
    scalability and maintainability issues. In particular, there is not
    yet an interoperability layer that combines the various systems into a
    virtual research environment (VRE) for mathematics.
    
    The OpenDreamKit project aims at building a toolkit for such VREs. It
    suggests using a central system-agnostic formalization of mathematics
    (Math-in-the-Middle, MitM) as the needed interoperability layer. In
    this paper, we conduct the first major case study that instantiates
    the MitM paradigm for a concrete domain as well as a concrete set of
    systems. Specifically, we integrate GAP, Sage, and Singular to perform
    computation in group and ring theory. 
    
    Our work involves massive practical efforts, including a novel
    formalization of computational group theory, improvements to the
    involved software systems, and a novel mediating system that sits at
    the center of a star-shaped integration layout between mathematical
    software systems.",

    "Despite its mathematical origins, progress in computer assisted
    reasoning has mostly been driven by applications in computer science,
    like hardware or protocol security verification. Paradoxically, it has
    yet to gain widespread acceptance in its original domain of
    application, mathematics; this is commonly attributed to a 'lack of
    libraries': attempts to formalize advanced mathematics get bogged down
    into the formalization of an unwieldly large set of basic resuts.

    This problem is actually a symptom of a deeper issue: the main
    function of computer proof systems, checking proofs down to their
    finest details, is at odds with mathematical practice, which ignores
    or defers details in order to apply and combine abstractions in
    creative and elegant ways. Mathematical texts commonly leave logically
    important parts of proofs as 'exercises to the reader', and are rife
    with 'abuses of notation that make mathematics tractable' (according
    to Bourbaki). This (essential) flexibility cannot be readily
    accomodated by the narrow concept of 'proof library' used by most
    proof assistants and based on 19th century first-order logic: a
    collection of constants, definitions, and lemmas.  

    This mismatch is familiar to software engineers, who have been
    struggling for the past 50 years to reconcile the flexibility needed
    to produce sensible user requirements with the precision needed to
    implement them correctly with computer code. Over the last 20 years
    object and components have replaced traditional data and procedure
    libraries, partly bridging this gap and making it possible to build
    significantly larger computer systems.  

    These techniques can be implemented in compuer proof systems by
    exploiting advances in mathematical logic. Higher-order logics allow
    the direct manipulation of functions; this can be used to assign
    behaviour, such as simplification rules, to symbols, similarly to
    objects. Advanced type systems can assign a secondary, contextual
    meaning to expressions, using mechanisms such as type classes, 
    similarly to the metadata in software components. The two can be combined
    to perform reflection, where an entire statement gets quoted as
    metadata and then proved algorithmically by some decision procedure.

    We propose to use a more modest, small-scale form of reflection, to
    implement mathematical components. We use the type-derived metadata to
    indicate how symbols, definitions and lemmas should be used in other
    theories, and functions to implement this usage — roughly, formalizing
    some of the exercize section of a textbook. We have applied
    successfully this more engineered approch to computer proofs in our
    past work on the Four Color Theorem, the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, and
    our ongoing long-term effort on the Odd Order Theorem, which is the
    starting point of the proof of the Classification of Finite Simple
    Groups (the famous 'monster theorem' whose proof spans 10,000 pages in
    400 articles).",

    "In the 50 years since McCarthy’s 'Recursive Functions of Symbolic
    Expressions and Their Computation by Machine', what have we
    learned about the realization of Leibniz’s dream of just being
    able to utter 'Calculemus!' (Let us calculate!) when faced with a
    mathematical dilemma?  

    In this talk, I will first present what I see as the most
    important lessons from the past which need to be heeded by modern
    designers. From the present, I will look at the context in which
    computers are used, and derive further requirements. In
    particular, now that computers are no longer the exclusive
    playground for highly educated scientists, usability is now more
    important than ever, and justifiably so.  

    I will also examine what I see as some principal failings of
    current systems, primarily to understand some major mistakes to
    avoid. These failings will be analyzed to extract what seems to be
    the root mistake, and I will present my favourite solutions.

    Furthermore, various technologies have matured since the creation
    of many of our systems, and whenever appropriate, these should be
    used. For example, our understanding of the structure of
    mathematics has significantly increased, yet this is barely
    reflected in our libraries. The extreme focus on efficiency by the
    computer algebra community, and correctness by the (interactive)
    theorem proving community should no longer be considered viable
    long term strategies.  But how does one effectively bridge that
    gap?  

    I personally find that a number of (programming) language-based
    solutions are particularly effective, and I will emphasize
    these. Solutions to some of these problems will be illustrated
    with code from a prototype of MathScheme 2.0, the system I am

    "We investigate the problem of translating between different styles of
    proof systems in higher-order logic: analytic proofs which are well
    suited for automated theorem proving, and non-analytic deductions
    which are well suited for the mathematician. Analytic proofs are
    represented as expansion proofs, $H$ , a form of the sequent calculus we
    define, non-analytic proofs are represented by natural deductions. A
    non-deterministic translation algorithm between expansion proofs and 
    $H$-deductions is presented and its correctness is proven. We also
    present an algorithm for translation in the other direction and prove
    its correctness. A cut-elimination algorithm for expansion proofs is
    given and its partial correctness is proven. Strong termination of
    this algorithm remains a conjecture for the full higher-order
    system, but is proven for the first-order fragment. We extend the
    translations to a non-analytic proof system which contains a primitive
    notion of equality, while leaving the notion of expansion proof
    unaltered. This is possible, since a non-extensional equality is
    definable in our system of type theory. Next we extend analytic and
    non-analytic proof systems and the translations between them to
    include extensionality.  Finally, we show how the methods and notions
    used so far apply to the problem of translating expansion proofs into
    natural deductions. Much care is taken to specify this translation in
    a modular way (through tactics) which leaves a large number of choices
    and therefore a lot of room for heuristics to produce elegant natural
    deductions. A practically very useful extension, called symmetric
    simplification, produces natural deductions which make use of lemmas

    would be created by earlier algorithms.",

    "Is the use of computer algebra technology beneficial for
    mechanised reasoining in and about mathematical domains? Usually
    it is assumed that it is. Many works in this area, however, either
    have little reasoning conent, or use symbolic computation only to
    simplify expressions. In work that has achieved more, the used
    methods do not scale up. They trust the computer algebra system
    either too much or too little.

    Computer algebra systems are not as rigorous as many provers. They
    are not logically sound reasoning systems, but collections of
    algorithms. We classify soundness problems that occur in computer
    algebra systems. While many algorithms and their implementations
    are perfectly trustworthy, the semantics of symbols is often
    unclear and leads to errors. On the other hand, more robust
    approaches to interface external reasoners to provers are not
    always practical because the mathematical depth of proofs
    algorithms in computer algebra are based on can be enormous.

    Our own approach takes both trustworthiness of the overall system
    and efficiency into account. It relies on using only reliable
    parts of a computer algebra system, which can be achieved by
    choosing a suitable library, and deriving specifications for these
    algorithms from their literature.

    We design and implement an interface between the prover Isabelle
    and the computer algebra library Sumit and use it to prove
    non-trivial theorems from coding theory. This is based on the
    mechanisation of the algebraic theories of rings and
    polynomials. Coding theory is an area where proofs do have a
    substantial amount of computational content. Also, it is realistic
    to assume that the verification of an encoding or decoding device
    could be undertaken in, and indeed, be simplified by, such a
    system. 

    The reason why semantics of symbols is often unclear in current
    computer algebra systems is not mathematical difficulty, but the
    design of those systems. For Gaussian elimination we show how the
    soundness problem can be fixed by a small extension, and without
    losing efficiency. This is a prerequisite for the efficient use of
    the algorithm in a prover.",

    structures will correspond to free algebras. This implies that we
    distinguish between generating and defined operations and that the
    underlying algebra has a mechanism of well-founded decomposition
    w.r.t. the generating operations. We show that the explicit
    specification of operations using so-called structural recursive
    schemata offers advantages over purely equational specifications,
    especially concerning the safeness of enrichments, the ease of
    semantics description and the separation between the underlying

    "When a C programmer needs an efficient data structure for a
    particular problem, he or she can often simply look one up in any of
    a number of good textbooks or handbooks.  Unfortunately, programmers
    in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have
    this luxury.  Although some data structures designed for imperative
    languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional
    setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on
    assignments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in
    functional languages.  To address this imbalance, we describe several
    techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous
    original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple
    variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many
    supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient
    catenation.

    In addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in
    amortized functional data structures.  Traditional methods of
    amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not
    just the most recent, are available for further processing.  This
    property is known as persistence , and is taken for granted in
    functional languages.  On the surface, persistence and amortization
    appear to be incompatible, but we show how lazy evaluation can be used
    to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are
    efficient even when used persistently.  Turning this relationship
    between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of
    amortization also provides the first practical techniques for
    analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs.

    Finally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming
    language designers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and
    lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial
    examples using polymorphic recursion and higher-order, recursive
    modules.",

    projects take months or years to complete. This creates difficulties
    because abstract mathematical requirements cannot easily be used by
    new members of a development team to understand past design
    decisions. Formal specifications describe what software must do, they

    a literate approach to software engineering is proposed. This
    technique integrates a formal specification language and a semi-formal
    design rationale.  The Z schema calculus is usecl to represent what a

    used to improve reliability of mission critical software; however
    it is hard to balance development time and budget with software
    reliability. Particularly using dynamic testing techniques, it is

    "In this article, we discuss several possible extensions to

    proposed here fall into two categories: logical extensions and the
    addition of constructs to allow for increased control.  There is a
    unifying theme to the proposed logical extensions, and that is the
    scoped introduction of extensions to a programming context. More
    specifically, these extensions are the ability to introduce variables
    whose scope is limited to the term in which they occur (i.e. A-bound
    variables within A-terms), the ability to intro~iuce into a goal a
    fresh constant whose scope is limited to the derivation of that goal,
    and the ability to introduce into a goal a program clause whose scope
    is limited to the derivation of that goal. The purpose of the
    additions for increased control is to facilitate the raising and
    handling of failures.
    
    To motivate these various extensions, we have repeatedly appealed to
    examples related to the construction of a generic theorem prover. It
    is our thesis that this problem domain is specific enough to lend
    focus when one is considering various language constructs, and yet
    complex enough to encompass many of the general difficulties found in
    other areas of symbolic computation.",

    attempt, we first discuss the motivation. We argue that logic
    programming is still immature, compared with functional programming,
    because few logic programs are both useful and pure.  Functions can
    help to purify logic programming, for they can eliminate certain uses
    of the cut and can express certMn negations positively.

    More generally, we suggest that the traditional paradigm -- logic
    programming as first-order logic -- is seriously out of step with
    practice. We offer an alternative paradigm. We view the logic program
    as an inductive definition of sets and relations. This view explains
    certain uses of Negation as Failure, and explains why most attempts to
    extend PROLO G to larger fragments of first-order logic have not been
    successful. It suggests a logic language with functions, 
    incorporating equational unification.

    We have implemented a prototype of this language. It is very slow,
    but complete, and appear to be faster than some earlier
    implementations of narrowing.  Our experiments illustrate the

    clause-language first-order prover that accumulates deduced clauses
    and uses strategies to control the deduction and retention of
    clauses. This is the first time that such a first-order prover has
    been combined in one program with a unification algorithm capable of
    instantiating variables to lambda terms to assist in the
    deductions. The resulting prover has all the advantages of the
    proof-search algorithm of Otter (speed, variety of inference rules,
    excellent handling of equality) and also the power of lambda
    unification. We illustrate how these capabilities work well together
    by using Otter-lambda to find proofs by mathematical induction. Lambda
    unification instantiates the induction schema to find a useful
    instance of induction, and then Otter's first-order reasoning can be
    used to carry out the base case and induction step. If necessary,
    induction can be used for those, too. We present and discuss a variety
    of examples of inductive proofs found by Otter-lambda: some in pure
    Peano arithmetic, some in Peano arithmetic with defined predicates,
    some in theories combining algebra and the natural numbers, some
    involving algebraic simplification (used in the induction step) by

    "There are two different styles for writing natural deduction proofs:
    the 'Gentzen' style in which a proof is a tree with the conclusion at
    the root and the assumptions at the leaves, and the 'Fitch' style
    (also called ‘flag’ style) in which a proof consists of lines that are
    grouped together in nested boxes.  
    
    In the world of proof assistants these two kinds of natural deduction
    correspond to procedural proofs (tactic scripts that work on one or
    more subgoals, like those of the Coq, HOL and PVS systems), and
    declarative proofs (like those of the Mizar and Isabelle/Isar
    languages).  
    
    In this paper we give an algorithm for converting tree style proofs to
    flag style proofs. We then present a rewrite system that simplifies
    the results.  
    
    This algorithm can be used to convert arbitrary procedural proofs to
    declarative proofs. It does not work on the level of the proof terms
    (the basic inferences of the system), but on the level of the
    statements that the user sees in the goals when constructing the
    proof.  
    
    The algorithm from this paper has been implemented in the ProofWeb
    interface to Coq. In ProofWeb a proof that is given as a Coq proof
    script (even with arbitrary Coq tactics) can be displayed both as a
    tree style and as a flag style proof.",

    of recursive types and the covariant B̈ohm order can be decided
    efficiently by means of finite automata, since they are just language

    "From a purely theoretical point of view, type inference for a
    functional language with parametric polymorphism and subtyping
    poses little difficulty. Indeed, it suffices to generalize the
    inference algorithm used in the ML language, so as to deal with
    type inequalities, rather than equalities. However, the number of
    such inequalities is linear in the program size -- whence, from a
    practical point of view, a serious efficiency and readability
    problem. 

    To solve this problem, one must simplify the inferred
    constraints. So, after studying the logical properties of
    subtyping constraints, this work proposes several simplifcation
    algorithms. They combine seamlessly, yielding a homogeneous, fully
    formal framework, which directly leads to an efficient
    implementation. Although this theoretical study is performed in a
    simplified setting, numerous extensions are possible. Thus, this
    framework is realistic and should allow a practical appearance of
    subtyping in languages with type inference.",

    A typed language GR with polymorphic functions leads to the GR
    inference rules. With the addition of an 'oracle' rule for equations
    between expressions, the GR rules become complete for a general class
    of semantic models of type inference. These inference models are
    models of untyped lambda calculus with extra structure similar to
    models of the typed language GR. A more specialized set of type
    inference rules, the GRS rules, characterize semantic typing when the
    functional type $a~$ , is interpreted as all elements of the model that
    map a to $~r$ and the polymorphic type $Vt,~0$ is interpreted as the
    intersection of all $o'(r)$. Both inference systems may be reformulated
    using rules for deducing containments between types. The advantage of
    the type inference rules based on containments is thatproofs
