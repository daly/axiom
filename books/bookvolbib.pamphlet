\chapter{The Axiom Bibliography}
This bibliography serves two purposes. It generates output for the
ACM bibliography (beebe.bib) and Axiom (axiom.bib).

This bibliography covers areas of computational mathematics.
Papers which mention Axiom have a ``keyword='' entry of ``axiomref''.
Papers we have on site have a ``paper='' entry. Papers which are
referenced in the algebra have the ``algebra'' tag.

The authors are listed in the index. The topic keywords are listed in the
index. Algorithms are mentioned in the index. 

The {\bf TO} index entry tries to say that the first
named algorithm or author has been updated or improved by the second
named algorithm or author.

Introduction of special terms (e.g. Toeplitz matrix) may include a
paragraph for those unfamiliar with the terms.

    "This paper describes the design of an algebra system Views
    implemented in Smalltalk. Views contains facilities for dynamic
    creation and manipulation of computational domains, for viewing these
    domains as various categories such as groups, rings, or fields, and
    for expressing algorithms generically at the level of categories. The
    design of Views has resulted in the addition of some new abstractions
    to Smalltalk that are quite useful in their own right. Parameterized
    classes provide a means for run-time creation of new classes that
    exhibit generally very similar behavior, differing only in minor ways
    that can be described by different instantiations of certain
    parameters. Categories allow the abstraction of the common behavior of
    classes that derives from the class objects and operations satisfying
    certain laws independently of the implementation of those objects and
    operations. Views allow the run-time association of classes with
    categories (and of categories with other categories), facilitating the
    use of code written for categories with quite different
    interpretations of operations. Together, categories and views provide
    an additional mechanism for code sharing that is richer than both
    single and multiple inheritance. The paper gives algebraic as well as
    non-algebraic examples of the above-mentioned features.",

  abstract =
    "We describe a framework and an algorithm for doing type inference
    analysis on programs written in full Common Lisp-84 (Common Lisp
    without the CLOS object-oriented extensions). The objective of
    type inference is to determine tight lattice upper bounds on the
    range of runtime data types for Common Lisp program variables and
    temporaries. Depending upon the lattice used, type inference can
    also provide range analysis information for numeric
    variables. This lattice upper bound information can be used by an
    optimizing compiler to choose more restrictive, and hence more
    efficient, representations for these program variables. Our
    analysis also produces tighter control flow information, which can
    be used to eliminate redundant tests which result in dead
    code. The overall goal of type inference is to mechanically
    extract from Common Lisp programs the same degree of
    representation information that is usually provided by the
    programmer in traditiional strongly-typed languages. In this way,
    we can provide some classes of Common Lisp programs execution time
    efficiency expected only for more strongly-typed compiled languages.
    
    The Nimble type inference system follows the traditional
    lattice/algebraic data flow techniques [Kaplan80], rather than the
    logical/theorem-proving unification techniques of ML [Milner78]. It
    can handle polymorphic variables and functions in a natural way, and
    provides for ``case-based'' analysis that is quite similar to that used
    intuitively by programmers. Additionally, this inference system can
    deduce the termination of some simple loops, thus providing
    surprisingly tight upper lattice bounds for many loop variables.
    
    By using a higher resolution lattice, more precise typing of primitive
    functions, polymorphic types and case analysis, the Nimble type
    inference algorithm can often produce sharper bounds than
    unification-based type inference techniques. At the present time,
    however, our treatment of higher-order data structures and functions
    is not as elegant as that of the unification techniques.",

    "The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) has received some praise and
    some criticism, both deserved. One of the most controversial
    features of standard CLOS is its linearly-ordered 'class
    precedence list', which is used to linearly order the execution of
    its 'combination' methods. In addition to the problems already
    known regarding the linear ordering of superclasses, we show that
    the standard CLOS class precedence ordering produces gratuitously
    complex and non-intuitive behavior. We then show that a slight
    modification of the standard ordering rules produces a linear
    ordering which can achieve most of the goals of CLOS more
    efficiently, and without impacting most programs. We describe a
    subset of CLOS called {\sl Static} CLOS which preserves much of
    the praise due CLOS, while eliminating some of the
    criticism. Static CLOS is tuned for {\sl deliver} of debugged
    code, rather than for prototype development. This 'delivery' CLOS
    determines as many methods as possible at compile-time using 'type
    inference' techniques. While these techniques generally result in
    faster-executing code, the space requirements can grow quite
    large. We argue that this space explosion can be partially
    ameliorated through the use of our modified class precedence
    ordering.",

    "It is widely recognized that programming languages should offer
    features to help structure programs. To achieve this goal, languages
    like Ada , Modula-2 , object-oriented languages, and functional
    languages have been developed. The structuring techniques available
    so far (like modules, classes, parametric polymorphism) are still not
    enough or not appropriate for some application areas. In symbolic
    computation, in particular computer algebra, several problems occur
    that are dicult to handle with any existing programming
    language. Indeed, nearly all available computer algebra systems suer
    from the fact that the underlying programming language imposes too
    many restrictions.
    
    We propose to develop a language that combines the essential features
    from functional languages, object-oriented languages, and computer
    algebra systems in a semantically clean manner. Although intended for
    use in symbolic computation, this language should prove interesting as
    a general purpose programming language.  The main innovation will be
    the application of sophisticated type systems to the needs of computer
    algebra systems. We will demonstrate the capabilities of the language
    by using it to implement a small computer algebra library. This 
    implementation will be compared against a straightforward Lisp
    implementation and against existing computer algebra systems. Our
    development should have an impact both on the programming languages

    " In this paper we introduce a statically-typed, functional,
    object-oriented programming language, TOOPL, which supports classes,
    objects, methods, instance variable, subtypes, and inheritance. It has
    proved to be surprisingly difficult to design statically-typed
    object-oriented languages which are nearly as expressive as Smalltalk
    and yet have no holes in their typing systems. A particular problem
    with statically type checking object-oriented languages is determining
    whether a method provided in a superclass will continue to type check
    when inherited in a subclass. This program is solved in our language
    by providing type checking rules which guarantee that a method which
    type checks as part of a class will type check correctly in all legal
    subclasses in which it is inherited. This feature enables library
    providers to provide only the interfaces of classes with executables
    and still allow users to safely create subclasses. The design of TOOPL
    has been guided by an analysis of the semantics of the language, which
    is given in terms of a sufficiently rich model of the F-bounded
    second-order lambda calculus. This semantics supported the language
    design by providing a means of proving that the type-checking rules
    for the language are sound, ensuring that well-typed terms produce
    objects of the appropriate type. In particular, in a well-typed
    program it is impossible to send a message to an object which lacks a

    $R+\beta+\nu+type-\beta+type-\nu$ rewriting of mixed terms is also
    strongly normalizing. We obtain this results using a technique which

    $\nu$ reduction does not commute with algebraic reduction, in general.

    "Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming
    languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages
    that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the
    relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming
    languages. 

    Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a
    motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type,
    data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of
    type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important
    form of polymorphism. We develop a $\lambda$-calculus-based model for type
    systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple
    setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming
    languages. 

    The evolution of languages from untyped universes to
    monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms
    for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and
    parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic
    type systems is developed in terms of the typed $\lambda$-calculus
    augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as
    binding of values by abstraction. 

    The typed $\lambda$-calculus is
    augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with
    type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information
    hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to
    model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple
    and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes
    abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance
    in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for
    the augmented $\lambda$-calculus are discussed. 

    The augmented typed
    $\lambda$-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of
    illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun
    instead of $\lambda$ is the functional abstraction keyword and because it
    is pleasant to deal with. 

    Fun is mathematically simple and can serve
    as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming
    languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive
    than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it
    provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented

    types and fixpoints.

    important applications have come about in such areas as theorem
    proving, type inference, program transformation, and machine learning.
    
    Another development is the discovery that by enriching 
    $\lambda_\rightarrow$ to include {\sl dependent function types},
    the resulting calculus ($\lambda_\Pi$) forms the basis of a very
    elegant and expressive Logical Framework, encompassing the syntax,
    rules, and proofs for a wide class of logics.
    
    This paper presents an algorithm in the spirit of Huet's, for
    unification in $\lambda_\Pi$. This algorithm gives us the best
    of both worlds: the automation previously possible in
    $\lambda_\rightarrow$ and the greatly enriched expressive power of
    $\lambda_\Pi$. It can be used to considerable advantage in many
    of the current applications of Huet's algorithm, and has important

    semantics based on term rewriting. We give the basic algebraic
    constructions for OSA, including quotient, image, product and term
    algebra, and we prove their basic properties, including quotient,
    homomorphism, and initiality theorems. The paper's major mathematical
    results include a notion of OSA deduction, a completeness theorem for
    it, and an OSA Birkhoff variety theorem. We also develop conditional
    OSA, including initiality, completeness, and McKinsey-Malcev
    quasivariety theorems, and we reduce OSA to (conditional) MSA, which
    allows lifting many known MSA results to OSA. Retracts, which
    intuitively are left inverses to subsort inclusions, provide
    relatively inexpensive run-time error handling. We show that it is
    safe to add retracts to any OSA signature, in the sense that it gives
    rise to a conservative extension. A final section compares and
    contrasts many different approaches to OSA. This paper also includes
    several examples demonstrating the flexibility and applicability of
    OSA, including some standard benchmarks like stack and list, as well

    calculus, our function calculus is predicative: the type system
    may be built up by induction on type levels. We show that, in a
    precise sense, the language becomes inconsistent if restrictions
    imposed by type levels are relaxed. More specifically, we prove
    that the important programming features of ML cannot be added to
    any impredicative language, such as the Girard-Reynolds calcus,
    without implicitly assuming a type of all types.",

    functor which acts on structures representing the parameters, and
    which yields a structure representing the behaviour. We characterise
    in domain-theoretic terms the class of functors which could in
    principle be specified and implemented; briefly, they are the functors
    which preserve directed colimits and whose restriction to finitely
    presented structures is recursively enumerable. We also characterise
    those functors which allow specification by initial semantics in
    universal Horn classes with finite vocabulary; these functors consist
    of a free functor (i.e. left adjoint of a forgetful functor) followed
    by a forgetful functor. The main result is that these two classes of

    "Types play an increasingly important role in logic programming, in
    language design as well as language implementation.  We present
    various views of types, their connection, and their role within the
    logic programming paradigm.  

    Among the basic views of types we find
    the so-called descriptive systems, where types describe properties of
    untyped logic programs, and prescriptive systems, where types are
    essential to the meaning of programs.  A typical application of
    descriptive types is the approximation of the meaning of a logic
    program as a subset of the Herbrand universe on which a predicate
    might be true.  The value of prescriptive systems lies primarily in
    program development, for example, through early detection of errors
    in programs which manifest themselves as type inconsistencies, or as
    added documentation for the intended and legal use of predicates.

    Central topics within these views are the problems of type inference
    and type reconstruction, respectively.  Type inference is a form of
    analysis of untyped logic programs, while type reconstruction attempts
    to fill in some omitted type information in typed logic programs and
    generalizes the problem of type checking.  Even though analogous
    problems arise in functional programming, algorithms addressing these
    problems are quite different in our setting.  

    Among the specific forms of types we discuss are simple types,
    recursive types, polymorphic types, and dependent types.  We also
    briefly touch upon subtypes and inheritance, and the role of types
    in module systems for logic programming languages."

  abstract =
    "Intersection types and bounded quantification are complementary 
    mechanisms for extending the expressive power of statically typed 
    programming languages. They begin with a common framework: a simple, 
    typed language with higher-order functions and a notion of subtyping. 
    Intersection types extend this framework by giving every pair of types
    $\sigma$ and $\tau$ a greatest lower bound, $\sigma \land \tau$,
    corresponding intuitively to the intersection of the sets of values
    described by $\sigma$ and $\tau$. Bounded quantification extends the
    basic framework along a different axis by adding polymorphic functions
    that operate uniformly on all the subtypes of a given type. This thesis
    unifies and extends prior work on intersection types and bounded
    quantification, previously studied only in isolation, by investigating
    theoretical and practical aspects of a typed $\lambda$-calculus
    incorporating both.
    
    The practical utility of this calculus, called $F_\land$ is
    established by examples showing, for instance, that it allows a rich
    form of ``coherent overloading'' and supports an analog of abstract
    interpretation during typechecking; for example, the addition function
    is given a type showing that it maps pairs of positive inputs to a
    positive result, pairs of zero inputs to a zero result, etc. More
    familiar programming examples are presented in terms of an extention
    of Forsythe (an Algol-like language with intersection types),
    demonstrating how parametric polymorphism can be used to simplify and
    generalize Forsythe's design. We discuss the novel programming and
    debugging styles that arise in $F_\land$.
    
    We prove the correctness of a simple semi-decision procedure for the
    subtype relation and the partial correctness of an algorithm for
    synthesizing minimal types of $F_\land$ terms. Our main tool in this
    analysis is a notion of ``canonical types,'' which allows proofs to be
    factored so that intersections are handled separately from the other
    type constructors.
    
    A pair of negative results illustrates some subtle complexities of
    $F_\land$. First, the subtype relation of $F_\land$ is shown to be
    undecidable; in fact, even the sutype relation of pure second-order
    bounded quantification is undecidable, a surprising result in its own
    right. Second, the failure of an important technical property of the
    subtype relation -- the existence of least upper bounds -- indicates
    that typed semantic models of $F_\land$ will be more difficult to
    construct and analyze than the known typed models of intersection
    types. We propose, for future study, some simpler fragments of
    $F_\land$ that share most of its essential features, while recovering
    decidability and least upper bounds.
    
    We study the semantics of $F_\land$ from several points of view. An
    untyped model based on partial equivalence relations demonstrates the
    consistency of the typing rules and provides a simple interpolation
    for programs, where ``$\sigma$ is a subtype of $\tau$'' is read as
    ``$\sigma$ is a subset of $\tau$.'' More refined models can be
    obtained using a translation from $F_\land$ into the pure polymorphic
    $\lambda$-calculus; in these models, ``$\sigma$ is a subtype of
    $\tau$'' is interpreted by an explicit coercion function from $\sigma$
    to $\tau$.  The nonexistence of least upper bounds shows up here in
    the failure of known techniques for proving the coherence of the
    translation semantics.  Finally, an equational theory of equivalences
    between $F_\land$ terms is presented and its soundness for both styles
    of model is verified.",

    subtyping.
    
    Curien and Ghelli proved the partial correctness of a recursive
    procedure for computing minimal types of $F_\le$ terms and showed
    that the termination of this procedure is equivalent to the
    termination of its major component, a procedure for checking the
    subtype relation between $F_\le$ types. Ghelli later claimed that
    this procedure is also guaranteed to terminate, but the discovery of a
    subtle bug in his proof led him recently to observe that, in fact,
    there are inputs on which the subtyping procedure diverges. This
    reopens the question of the decidability of subtyping and hence of
    typechecking.
    
    This question is settled here in the negative, using a reduction from
    the halting problem for two-counter Turing machines to show that the

    "Static and dynamic type systems have well-known strengths and
    weaknesses, and each is better suited for different programming
    tasks. There have been many efforts to integrate static and dynamic
    typing and thereby combine the benefits of both typing disciplines in
    the same language. The flexibility of static typing can be improved
    by adding a type Dynamic and a typecase form. The safety and
    performance of dynamic typing can be improved by adding optional type
    annotations or by performing type inference (as in soft
    typing). However, there has been little formal work on type systems
    that allow a programmer-controlled migration between dynamic and
    static typing. Thatte proposed Quasi-Static Typing, but it does not
    statically catch all type errors in completely annotated
    programs. Anderson and Drossopoulou defined a nominal type system
    for an object-oriented language with optional type annotations.
    However, developing a sound, gradual type system for functional
    languages with structural types is an open problem.

    In this paper we present a solution based on the intuition that the
    structure of a type may be partially known/unknown at compile- time
    and the job of the type system is to catch incompatibilities between
    the known parts of types. We define the static and dynamic semantics
    of a $lambda$-calculus with optional type annotations and we prove that 
    its type system is sound with respect to the simply-typed λ
    $lambda$-calculus for fully-annotated terms. We prove that this 
    calculus is type safe and that the cost of dynamism is 
   'pay-as-you-go'.",

    paper was written after the course was finished. In spite of this, and
    only partly because of the shortage of time, the paper still retains
    many of the shortcomings of a lecture course. The chief of these are
    an uncertainty of aim—it is never quite clear what sort of audience
    there will be for such lectures—and an associated switching from
    formal to informal modes of presentation which may well be less
    acceptable in print than it is natural in the lecture room. For these
    (and other) faults, I apologise to the reader.
    
    There are numerous references throughout the course to CPL [1–3]. This
    is a programming language which has been under development since 1962
    at Cambridge and London and Oxford. It has served as a vehicle for
    research into both programming languages and the design of
    compilers. Partial implementations exist at Cambridge and London. The
    language is still evolving so that there is no definitive manual
    available yet. We hope to reach another resting point in its evolution
    quite soon and to produce a compiler and reference manuals for this
    version. The compiler will probably be written in such a way that it
    is relatively easyto transfer it to another machine, and in the first
    instance we hope to establish it on three or four machines more or
    less at the same time.
    
    The lack of a precise formulation for CPL should not cause much
    difficulty in this course, as we are primarily concerned with the
    ideas and concepts involved rather than with their precise
    representation in a programming language.",

    "There is a variety of situations in programming in which it is useful
    to think of two distinct types as representations of the same abstract

    be effectively expressed at an abstract level are lacking.  We propose
    a generalization of ML-style type inference to deal effectively with
    this problem.  Under the generalization, the (normally free) algebra
    of type expressions is subjected to an equational theory generated by
    a finite set of user-specified equations that express
    interconvertibility relations between objects of ``equivalent'' types.
    Each type equation is accompanied by a pair of conversion functions
    that are (at least partial) inverses.  We show that so long as the
    equational theory satisfies a reasonably permissive syntactic
    constraint, the resulting type system admits a complete type 
    inference algorithm that produces unique principal types.  The main
    innovation required in type inference is the replacement of ordinary
    free unification by unification in the user-specified equational
    theory.  The syntactic constraint ensures that the latter is unitary,
    i.e., yields unique most general unifiers.  The proposed constraint is
    of independent interest as the first known syntactic
    characterization for a class of unitary theories.  Some of the
    applicatloils of the system are similar to those of Wadler's views

    instantiation) with rewriting steps (application of definitions) and
    solving procedures based on algebraic techniques (e.g. Groebner Bases,
    Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition).
    
    If one formalizes the main notions of elementary analysis like
    continuity, convergence, etc., usually a sequence of alternating
    quantifier blocks pops up in the quantifier prefix of the
    corresponding formula. This makes the proof problems involving these
    notions not easy. S-Decomposition strategy is expecially suitable for
    property-preserving problems like continuity of sum, becuase it is
    designed for handling problems where the goal and the main assumptions
    have a similar structure. During proof deduction, existentially
    quantified goals and universal assumptions are handled by introducing
    metavariables, if no suitable ground instance is known in
    adva=nce. For finalizing proof attempts, the metavariables should be
    instantiated in such a way that they satisfy the cumulated algebraic
    constraints collected during the proof attempt. The instantiation
    problem is considered to be difficult in the logical
    calculus. Appropriate instances can be often found using quantifier
    elimination (QE) over real closed fields. In order to obtain witness
    terms we utilize the QE method based on cylindrical algebraic
    decomposition (CAD) [Collins 1975]. However, the QE method alone is
    not sufficient. One needs to pre-process the (closed, quantified)

    undecidable. Then we consider a limited form of recursion called
    parametric recursion. We show that although the problem becomes

    "Order-sorted specifications (i.e. many-sorted specifications with
    subsort relations) have been proved to be a useful tool for the
    description of partially defined functions and error handling in
    abstract data types.
    
    Several definitions for order-sorted algebras have been proposed. In
    some papers an operator symbol, which may be multiply declared, is
    interpreted by a family of functions (“overloaded” algebras). In other
    papers it is always interpreted by a single function (“nonoverloaded”
    algebras). On the one hand, we try to demonstrate the differences
    between these two approaches with respect to equality, rewriting and
    completion; on the other hand, we prove that in fact both theories can
    be studied in parallel provided that certain notions are suitably
    defined.
    
    The overloaded approach differs from the many-sorted and the
    nonoverloaded one in that the overloaded term algebra is not
    necessarily initial. We give a decidable sufficient criterion for the
    initiality of the term algebra, which is less restrictive than
    GJM-regularity as proposed by Goguen, Jouannaud and Meseguer.
    
    Sort-decreasingness is an important property of rewrite systems since
    it ensures that confluence and Church-Rosser property are equivalent,
    that the overloaded and nonoverloaded rewrite relations agree, and
    that variable overlaps do not yield critical pairs. We prove that it
    is decidable whether or not a rewrite rule is sort-decreasing, even if
    the signature is not regular.
    
    Finally, we demonstrate that every overloaded completion procedure may
    also be used in the nonoverloaded world, but not conversely, and that
    specifications exist that can only be completed using the
    nonoverloaded semantics.",

    "Data structures, algorithms and programming languages can be
    described in a uniform implementation-independent way by axiomatic
    abstract data types i.e. by algebraic specifications defining
    abstractly the properties of objects and functions. Different semantic
    models such as initial and terminal algebras have been proposed in
    order to specify the meaning of such specifications -often involving a
    considerable amount of category theory. A more concrete semantics
    encompassing these different approaches is presented:

    Abstract data types are specified in hierarchies, employing
    ``primitive'' types on which other types are based. The semantics is
    defined to be the class of all partial heterogeneous algebras
    satisfying the axioms and respecting the hierarchy. The interpretation
    of a specification as its initial or terminal algebra is just a
    constraint on the underlying data. These constraints can be modified
    according to the specification goals. E.g. the data can be specified
    using total functions; for algorithms partial functions with
    syntactically checkable domains seem appropriate whereas for
    programming languages the general notion of partiality is needed,
    Model-theoretic and deduction-oriented conditions are developed which
    ensure properties leading to criteria for the soundness and complexity
    of specifications. These conditions are generalized to parameterized
    types, i.e. type procedures mapping types into types. Syntax and
    different semantics of parameter are defined and discussed. Criteria
    for proper parameterized specifications are developed. It is shown
    that the properties of proper specifications viz. of snowballing and
    impeccable types are preserved under application of parameterized
    types — finally guaranteeing that the composition of proper small
    specifications always leads to a proper large specification."

    Sparse and structured matrices over finite fields occur in many
    settings.  Sparse linear systems arise in sieve-based integer factoring
    and discrete logarithm algorithms. Structured matrices arise in
    polynomial factoring algorithms; one example is the famous Q-matrix
    from Berlekamp's method.  Sparse diophantine linear problems, like
    computing the Smith canonical form of an integer matrix or computing
    an integer solution to a sparse linear system, are reduced via p-adic
    lifting to sparse matrix analysis over a finite field.

    In the past 10 years there has been substantial activity on the
    improvement of a solution proposed by Wiedemann in 1986. The main new
    ingredients are faster pre-conditioners, projections by an entire
    block of random vectors, Lanczos recurrences, and a connection to
    Kalman realizations of control theory. My talk surveys these
    developments and describe some major unresolved problems.",

    The main idea of the ``black box'' approach in exact linear algebra is
    to reduce matrix problems to the computation of minimum polynomials.
    In most cases preconditioning is necessary to obtain the desired
    result.  Here good preconditioners will be used to ensure geometrical
    / algebraic properties on matrices, rather than numerical ones, so we
    do not address a condition number. We offer a review of problems for
    which (algebraic) preconditioning is used, provide a bestiary of
    preconditioning problems, and discuss several preconditioner types to
    solve these problems.  We present new conditioners, including
    conditioners to preserve low displacement rank for Toeplitz-like
    matrices. We also provide new analyses of preconditioner performance
    and results on the relations among preconditioning problems and with
    linear algebra problems.  Thus, improvements are offered for the
    efficiency and applicability of preconditioners. The focus is on
    linear algebra problems over finite fields, but most results are valid

    The computation of the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ of
    numbers or polynomials is a challenge for both numerical and symbolic
    methods. Numerical methods, such as Clarkson's algorithm [10,7] for
    the sign of the determinant must deal with conditionedness that
    determines the number of mantissa bits necessary for obtaining a
    correct sign. Symbolic algorithms that are based on Chinese
    remaindering [6,17,Chapter 5.5] must deal with the fact that the
    length of the determinant in the worse case grows linearly in the
    dimension of the matrix. Hence the number of modular operations is $n$
    times the number of arithmetic operations in a given algorithm.
    Hensel lifting combined with rational number recovery [14,1] has cubic
    bit complexity in $n$, but the algorithm can only determine a factor
    of the determinant, namely the largest invariant factor. If the matrix
    is similar to a multiple of the identity matrix, the running time is
    again that of Chinese remaindering.",

\index{explain!Sylvester matrix}
The Sylvester matrix is used to compute the {\bf resultant} of two
polynomials. The Sylvester matrix is formed from the coefficients of
the two polynomials. Given a polynomial with degree $m$ and another of
degree $n$ form an $(m+n)\times(m+n)$ matrix by filling the matrix
from the upper left corner with the coefficients of the first
polynomial then shifting down one row and one column to the right and
filling in the coefficients starting there until they hit the right
column.  Starting at the next row, do the same process for the second
polynomial.  The determinant of this matrix is the {\bf resultant} of
the two polynomials.

For example, given $a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ and $b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0$
the Sylvester matrix is a $(3+2)\times(3+2)$ matrix:
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & 0\\
0 & a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0\\
b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0
\end{array}\right]\]

\index{explain!resultant}
The resultant of these two polynomials (assuming a leading coefficient
of 1), is the product of the differences $p_i-q_i$ between the roots
of the polynomials. If there are roots in common then the product
will contain a 0 and the whole equation reduces to 0. This can be
used to determine if two polynomials have common roots.

For example, given a polynomial in $x$ with distinct roots $a_1$ 
and $a_2$ it can be factored as $t1:=(x-a_1)(x-a_2)$. 

Given a second polynomial in $x$ with distinct roots $b_1$, $b_2$, 
and $b_3$ it can be factored as $t2:=(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)$.

The Axiom call of $resultant(t1,t2,x)$ is
\[ (b_1-a_2)(b_1-a_1)(b_2-a_2)(b_2-a_1)(b_3-a_2)(b_3-a_1) \]

In symbolic form the resultant can show the multiplicity of roots
when shown in factored form.

    The Toeplitz-likeness of a matrix (Kailath et al. 1979) is the
    generalization of the notion that a matrix is Toeplitz. Block matrices
    with Toeplitz blocks, such as the Sylvester matrix corresponding to
    the resultant of two univariate polynomials, are Toeplitz-like, as are
    products and inverses of Toeplitz-like matrices. The displacement rank
    of a matrix is a measure for the degree of being Toeplitz-like. For
    example, an $r\times s$ block matrix with Toeplitz blocks has
    displacement rank $r+s$ whereas a generic $N\times N$ matrix has
    displacement rank $N$.  A matrix of displacement rank $\alpha$ can be
    implicitly represented by a sum of $\alpha$ matrices, each of which is
    the product of a lower trainagular and an upper triangular Toeplitz
    matrices. Such a $\sigma LU$ representation can usually be obtained

    Douglas Wiedemann's (1986) landmark approach to solving sparse linear
    systems over finite fields provides the symbolic counterpart to
    non-combinatorial numerical methods for solving sparse linear systems,
    such as the Lanczos or conjugate gradient method (see Golub and van
    Loan (1983)). The problem is to solve a sparse linear system, when the
    individual entries lie in a generic field, and the only operations
    possible are field arithmethic; the solution is to be exact. Such is
    the situation, for instance, if one works in a finite field. Wiedemann
    bases his approach on Krylov subspaces, but projects further to a
    sequence of individual field elements. By making a link to the
    Berlekamp / Massey problem from coding theory -- the coordinate
    recurrences -- and by using randomization an algorithm is obtained
    with the following property. On input of an $n\times n$ coefficient
    matrix $A$ given by a so-called black box, which is a program that can
    multiply the matrix by a vector (see Figure 1), and of a vector $b$,
    the algorithm finds, with high probability in case the system is
    solvable, a random solution vector $x$ with $Ax=b$. It is assumed that
    the field has sufficiently many elements, say no less than $50n^2
    log(x)$, otherwise one goes to a finite algebraic extension. The
    complexity of the method is in the general singular case $O(n log
    (n))$ calls to the black box for $A$ and an additional $O(n^2
    log(n)^2)$ field arithmetic operations.",

    "Two earlier papers described the generalizations of Euclid's
    algorithm to deal with the problem of computing the greatest common
    divisor (GCD) or the resultant of a pair of polynomials. A sequal to
    those two papers is presented here.
    
    In attempting such a generalization one easily arrives at the concept
    of a polynomial remainder sequence (PRS) and then quickly discovers
    the phenomenon of explosive coefficient growth.  Fortunately, this
    explosive growth is not inherent in the problem, but is only an
    artifact of various naive solutions. If one removes the content (that
    is, the GCD of the coefficients) from each polynomial in a PRS, the
    coefficient growth in the resulting primitive PRS is relatively modest.
    However, the cost of computing the content (by applying Euclid's
    algorithm in the coefficient domain) may be unacceptably or even
    prohibitively high, especially if the coefficients are themselves
    polynomials in one or more addltional variables.
    
    The key to controlling coefficient growth without the costly
    computation of GCD's of coefficients is the fundamental theorem of
    subresuitants, which shows that every polynomial in a PRS is
    proportional to some subresultant of the first two.  By arranging for
    the constants of proportionahty to be unity, one obtains the
    subresultant PRS algorithm, in which the coefficient growth is
    essentially linear.  A corollary of the fundamental theorem is given
    here, which leads to a simple derivation and deeper understanding of
    the subresultant PRS algorithm and converts a conjecture mentioned in
    the earlier papers into an elementary remark.
    
    A possible alternative method of constructing a subresultant PRS is to
    evaluate all the subresultants directly from Sylvester's determinant
    via expansion by minors. A complexity analysis is given in conclusion,
    along lines pioneered by Gentleman and Johnson, showing that the
    subresultant PRS algorithm is superior to the determinant method
    whenever the given polynomials are sufficiently large and dense, but
    is inferior in the sparse extreme.",

    "A computer program to honestly plot curves y = f(x) must locate

    solve a classic problem in computation – global optimization.
    Reducing an easy problem to a hard one is usually not an advantage,
    but in fact there is a route to solving both problems if the function
    can be evaluated using interval arithmetic.  Since some computer
    algebra systems supply a version of interval arithmetic, it seems we
    have the ingredients for a solution.  

    In this paper we address a particular problem how to compute and
    display ``honest'' graphs of 2-D mathematical curves.  By
    ``honest'' we mean that no significant features (such as the
    location of poles, the values at maxima or minima, or the behavior
    of a curve at asymptotes) are misrepresented, By “mathematical” we
    mean curves like those generally needed in scientific disciplines
    where functions are represented by composition of common
    mathematical operations: rational operations ($+, –, *, /$),
    exponential and log, trigonometric functions as well as continuous

    On the other hand, commutative algebra is that part of mathematics
    which studies commutative rings.
    
    Our aim is to make this link more precise. It will appear that most of
    the constructions which appear in classical commutative algebra can be
    done explicitly in finite time. However, there are
    exceptions. Moreover, most of the known algorithms are intractable :
    The problems are generally exponential by themselves, but many
    algorithms are over-over-exponential. It needs a lot of work to find
    better methods, and to implement them, with the final hope to open a
    computation domain larger than this one which is possible by hand.
    
    To illustrate the limits and the possibilities of computerizing
    commutative algebra, we describe an algorithm which tests the
    primality of a polynomial ideal and we give an example of a single
    algebraic extension of fields $K\subset L$ wuch that there exists an

    factoring $f$.

    These algorithms are probabilistic in the following sense. The
    time of computation depends on random choices, but the validity of
    the result does not depend on them. So, worst case complexity,
    being infinite, is meaningless and we compute average

    have the same asymptotic complexity and they are the best
    algorithms actuall known; with elementary multiplication and GCD
    computation, Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithm is always bettern than
    ours; with fast multiplication and GCD, it seems that ours is
    better, but this fact is not yet proven.

    Finally, for factoring polynomials over the integers, it seems
    that the best strategy consists in choosing prime moduli as big as
    possible in the range where the time of the multiplication does
    not depend on the size of the factors (machine word size). An

    example, for the factorization of the RSA-130 challenge number several
    column dependencies of a $3504823\times 3516502$ matrix with an
    average of $39.4.$ non-zero entries per column needed to be computed

    algorithm [6]. In that example, the matrix is not explicitly

    times vector product is used. Further examples for such ``black box

    The success of the symbolic mathematical computation discipline is

    Gr{\"o}bner bases, the Risch integration algorithm, integer lattice

    scientists, engineers, and education: {SAC-1}, {Reduce}, {Macsyma}, etc.
    The commercial viability of our system products is proven by Maple and
    Mathematica.

    Today's user communities of symbolic computation systems are diverse:
    educators, engineers, stock market anaysts, etc. The mathematics and
    computer science in the design and implementation of our algorithms are

    One generic parallel evaluation scheme for algebraic objects, that of
    evaluating algebraic computation trees or formulas, is presented by
    Miller in a preceding chapter of this book. However, there are basic
    algebraic functions for which the tree model of computation seems not
    sufficient to allow an eficient -- even sequential -- decision-free
    algebraic computation. The formula model essentially restricts the use
    of an intermediate result to a single place, because the parse tree
    nodes have fan-out one. If an intermediate result participates in the
    computations of several further nodes, in the tree model it must be
    recomputed anew for each of these nodes. It is a small formal change
    to allow node values to propagate to more than one node deeper level
    of the computation. Thus we obtain the {\sl algebraic circuit model},
    which is equivalent to the {\sl straight-line program model}.",

    We give a stability criterion for real polynomial inequalities with
    floating point or inexact scalars by estimating from below or
    computing the radius of semdefiniteness. That radious is the maximum
    deformation of the polynomial coefficent vector measured in a weighted
    Euclidean vector norm within which the inequality remains true. A
    large radius means that the inequalities may be considered numerically
    valid.

    The radius of positive (or negative) semidefiniteness is the distance
    to the nearest polynomial with a real root, which has been thoroughly
    studied before. We solve this problem by parameterized Lagrangian
    multipliers and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our algorithms can
    compute the radius for several simultaneous inequalities including
    possibly additional linear coefficient constraints. Our distance
    measure is the weighted Euclidena coefficient norm, but we also
    discuss several formulas for the weighted infinity and 1-norms.

    The computation of the nearest polynomial with a real root can be
    interpreted as a dual of Seidenberg's method that decides if a real
    hypersurface contains a real point. Sums-of-squares rational lower
    bound certificates for the radius of semidefinitesness provide a new
    approach to solving Seidenberg's problem, especially when the
    coeffcients are numeric. They also offer a surprising alternative
    sum-of-squares proof for those polynomials that themselves cannot be
    represented by a polynomial sum-of-squares but that have a positive

    Several standard problems in symbolic computation, such as greatest
    common divisors and factorization of polynomials, sparse
    interpolation, or computing solutions to overdetermined systems of
    polynomial equations have non-trivial solutions only if the input
    coefficients satisfy certain algebraic constraints. Errors in the
    coefficients due to floating point round-off or through physical
    measurement thus render the exact symbolic algorithms unusable. By
    symbolic-numeric methods one computes minimal deformations of the
    coefficients that yield non-trivial results. We will present hybrid
    algorithms and benchmark computations based on Gauss-Newton
    optimazation, singular value decomposition (SVD) and
    structure-preserving total least squares (STLS) fitting for several of
    the above problems.

    A significant body of results to solve those ``approximate computer
    algebra'' problems has been discovered in the past 10 years. In the
    Computer Algebra Handbook the section on ``Hybrid Methods'' concludes
    as follows [2]: ``The challenge of hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms
    is to explore the effects of imprecision, discontinuity, and
    algorithmic complexity by applying mathematical optimization,
    perturbation theory, and inexact arithmetic and other tools in order
    to solve mathematical problems that today are not solvable by
    numeriiical or symbolic methods alone.'' The focus of our tutorial is
    on how to formulate several approximate symbolic computation problems
    as numerical problems in linear algebra and optimization and on
    software that realizes their solutions.",

    takes values for the variables as input and evaluates the polynomial

    and factorize polynomials in black box representation, producing as
    output new black boxes. It also can compute the standard sparse

    "We define reproducibility to mean getting bitwise identical results
    from multiple runs of the same program, perhaps with different
    hardware resources or other changes that should ideally not change the
    answer. Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or
    correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing
    resources, combined with nonassociativity of floating point addition,
    makes attaining reproducibility a challenge even for simple operations
    like summing a vector of numbers, or more complicated operations like
    Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We describe an algorithm that
    computes a reproducible sum of floating point numbers independent of
    the order of summation. The algorithm depends only on a subset of the
    IEEE Floating Point Standard 754-2008. It is communication-optimal, in
    the sense that it does just one pass over the data in the sequential
    case, or one reduction operation in the parallel case, requiring an
    ``accumulator'' represented by just 6 floating point words (more can
    be used if higher precision is desired). Th arithmetic code with a
    6-word accumulator is $7n$ floating point additions to sum $n$ words,
    and (in IEEEE double precision) the final error bound can be up to
    $10^8$ times smaller than the error bound for conventional
    summation. We describe the basic summation algorithm, the software
    infrastructure used to build reproducible BLAS (ReproBLAS), and
    performance results. For example, when computing the dot product of
    4096 double precision floating point numbers, we get a $4x$ slowdown

    i7-2600 CPU operating at 3.4 GHz and 256 KB L2 Cache.",

  abstract = 
    "A suite of {\sl self-scaling} fast circular plane rotation algorithms
    is developed which obviates the monitoring and periodic rescaling
    necessitated by the standard set of fast plane rotation
    algorithms. Self-Scaling fast rotations dynamically preserve the
    normed scaling of the diagonal factor matrix whereas standard fast
    rotations exhibit divergent scaling. Variations on standard fast
    rotation matrices are developed and algorithms which implement them
    are offered. Self-Scaling fast rotations are shown to be essentially
    as accurate as slow rotations and at least as efficient as standard
    fast rotations. Computational experimental results utilizing the
    Cray-2 illustrate the effectively stable scaling exhibited by
    self-scaling fast rotations. Jacobi-class algorithms with one-sided
    alterations are developed for the algebraic eigenvalue decomposition
    using self-scaling fast plane rotations and one-sided
    modifications. The new algorithms are shown to be both accurate and
    efficient on both vector and parallel architectures. The utility is
    described of applying fast plane rotations towards the rank-one update
    and downdate of least squares factorizations. The equivalence is
    illuminated of LINPACK, hyperbolic rotation, and fast negatively
    weighted plane rotation downdating. Algorithms are presented which
    apply self-scaling fast plane rotations to the QR factorization for
    stiff least squares problems. Both fast and standard Givens
    rotation-based algorithms are shown to produce accurate results
    regardless of row sorting even with extremely heavily row weighted
    matrices. Such matrices emanate, e.g. from equality constrainted least
    squares problems solved via the weighting method. The necessity of
    column sorting is emphasized. Numerical tests expose the Householder
    QR factorization algorithm to be sensitive to row sorting and it
    yields less accurate results for greater weights. Additionally, the
    modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is shown to be sensitive to row
    sorting to a notably significant but lesser degree. Self-Scaling fast
    plane rotation algorithms, having competitive computational
    complexities, must therefore be the method of choice for the QR
    factorization of stiff matrices. Timing reults on the Cray 2 [XY]M/P,
    and C90, of rotations both in and out of a matrix factorization
    context are presented. Architectural features that can best exploit
    the advantagous features of the new fast rotations are subsequently
    discussed.",

    problems economically: much faster and using far less memory than if
    all the entries of a matrix were stored and took part in explicit
    computations. These methods form the backbone of a wide range of
    problems in computational science. A glimpse of the breadth of
    applications relying on sparse solvers can be seen in the origins of
    matrices in published matrix benchmark collections. The goal of this
    survey article is to impart a working knowledge of the underlying
    theory and practice of sparse direct methods for solving linear
    systems and least-squares problems, and to provide an overview of the

    in the 1960s as a means to compute very accurate solutions to all but
    the most ill-conditioned linear systems of equations. However two
    obstacles hae until now prevented its adoption in standard subroutine
    libraries like LAPACK: (1) There was no standard way to access the
    higher precision arithmetic needed to compute residuals, and (2) it
    was unclear how to compute a reliable error bound for the computed
    solution. The completion of the new BLAS Technical Forum Standard has
    recently removed the first obstacle. To overcome the second obstacle,
    we show how a single application of iterative refindment can be used
    to copute an error bound in any norm at small cost, and use this to
    compute both an error bound in the usual infinity norm, and a
    componentwise relative error bound.

    We report extensive test results on over 6.2 million matrices of
    dimension 5, 10, 100, and 1000. As long as a normwise
    (resp. componentwise) condition number computed by the algorithm is
    less than $1/max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, the computed normwise
    (resp. componentwise) error bound is at most
    $2max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, and indeed bounds the true error. Here,
    $n$ is the matrix dimension and $\epsilon_w$ is a single precision
    roundoff error. For worse conditioned problems, we get similarly small
    correct error bounds in over 89.4\% of cases.",

    "Computing the eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors of an $n\times n$
    symmetric tridiagonal matrix is an important task that arises while
    solving any symmetric eigenproblem. All practical software requires
    $O(n^3)$ time to compute all the eigenvectors and ensure their
    orthogonality when eigenvalues are close. In the first part of this
    thesis we review earlier work and show how some existing
    implementations of inverse iteration can fail in surprising ways.
    
    The main contribution of this thesis is a new $O(n^2)$, easily
    parallelizable algorithm for solving the tridiagonal
    eigenproblem. Three main advances lead to our new algorithm. A
    tridiagonal matrix is traditionally represented by its diagonal and
    off-diagonal elements. Our most important advance is in recognizing
    that its bidiagonal factors are ``better'' for computational
    purposes. The use of bidiagonals enables us to invoke a relative
    criterion to judge when eigenvalues are ``close''. The second advance
    comes with using multiple bidiagonal factorizations in order to
    compute different eigenvectors independently of each other. Thirdly,
    we use carefully chosen dqds-like transformations as inner loops to
    compute eigenpairs that are highly accurate and ``faithful'' to the
    various bidiagonal representations. Orthogonality of the eigenvectors
    is a consequence of this accuracy. Only $O(n)$ work per eigenpair is
    neede by our new algorithm.
    
    Conventional wisdom is that there is usually a trade-off between speed
    and accuracy in numerical procedures, i.e., higher accuracy can be
    achieved only at the expense of greater computing time. An interesting
    aspect of our work is that increased accuracy in the eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors obviates the need for explicit orthogonalization and
    leads to greater speed.
    
    We present timing and accuracy results comparing a computer
    implementation of our new algorithm with four existing EISPACK and
    LAPACK software routines. Our test-bed contains a variety of
    tridiagonal matrices, some coming from quantum chemistry
    applications. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of
    our new algorithm. For example, on a matrix of order 966 that occurs in
    the modeling of a biphenyl molecule our method is about 10 times
    faster than LAPACK's inverse iteration on a serial IBM RS/6000
    processor and nearly 100 times faster on a 128 processor IBM SP2
    parallel machine.",

    "We present new recursive serial and parallel algorithms for QR
    factorization of an $m$ by $n$ matrix. They improve performance. The
    recursion leads to an automatic variable blocking, and it also
    replaces a Level 2 part in a standard aglorithm with Level 3
    operations. However, there are significant additional costs for
    creating and performing the updates, which prohibit the efficient use
    of the recursion for large $n$. We present a quantitative analysis of
    these extra costs. This analysis leads us to introduce a hybrid
    recursive algorithm that outperforms the LAPACK algorithm DGEQRF by
    about 20\% for large square matrices up to almost a factor of 3 for
    tall thin matrices. Uniprocessor performance results are presented for
    two IBM RS/6000 SP nodes -- a 120-Mhz IBM POWER2 node and one
    processor of a four-way 332-Mhz IBM PowerPC 604e SMP node. The hybrid
    recursive algorithm reaches more than 90\% of the theoretical peak
    performance of the POWER2 node. Compared to standard block algorithms,
    the recursive approach also shows a significant advantage in the
    automatic tuning obtained from its automatic variable blocking. A
    successful parallel implementation on a four-way 332-MHz IBM PPC604e
    SMP node based on dynamic load balancing is presented. For two, three,
    and four processors it shows speedups of up to 1.97, 299, and 3.97."

    "Many ambitious computer algebra systems were initially designed in a
    flush of enthusiasm, with the goal of automating any symbolic
    mathematical manipulation ``correctly''. Historically, this approach
    results in programs that implicitly used certain identities to
    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed
    universally true to the programmers in the heat of writing the CAS
    (and often were true in well-known abstract algebraic domains) later
    neede re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new
    objects are generally introduced to the CAS by extending
    ``generically'' the arithmetic of other operations. For example,
    approximate floats do not have the mathematical properties of exact
    integers or rationals. Complex numbers may strain a system designed
    for real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider
    two categories of ``extended'' numbers: $\infty$ and {\sl undefined},
    and real intervals. We comment on issues raised by these two
    troublesome notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra
    system may require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign
    of parts of the program, and how they are related. An alternative
    (followed most notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision
    a ``meta'' CAS defined in terms of categories and inheritance with
    only the most fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build
    many variants of specific CAS features. This approach is appealing but
    can fail to accommodate extensions that violate some mathematical
    tenets in the cause of practicality.",

    "Bisection is one of the most common methods used to compute the
    eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrices. Bisection relies on the
    {\sl Sturm count}: for a given shift $\sigma$, the number of negative
    pivots in the factorization $T-\sigma{}I=LDL^T$ equals the number of
    eigenvalues of $T$ that are smaller than $\sigma$. In IEEE-754
    arithmetic, the value $\infty$ permits the computation to continue
    past a zero pivot, producing a correct Sturm count when $T$ is
    unreduced. Demmel and Li showed in the 90s that using $\infty$ rather
    than testing for zero pivots within the loop could improve performance
    significantly on certain architectures.
    
    When eigenvalues are to be computed to high relative accuracy, it is
    often preferable to work with $LDL^T$ factorizations instead of the
    original tridiagonal $T$, see for example the MRRR algorithm. In these
    cases, the Sturm count has to be computed from $LDL^T$. The
    differential stationary and progressive qds algorithms are the method
    of choice.
    
    While it seems trivial to replace $T$ by $LDL^T$, in reality these
    algorithms are more complicated: in IEEE-754 arithmetic, a zero pivot
    produces an overflow, followed by an invalid exception (NaN), that
    renders the Sturm count incorrect.
    
    We present alternative, safe formulations that are guaranteed to
    produce the correct result.
    
    Benchmarking these algorithms on a variety of platforms shows that the
    original formulation without tests is always faster provided no
    exception occurs. The transforms see speed-ups of up to 2.6x over the
    careful formulation.
    
    Tests on industrial matrices show that encountering exceptions in
    practice is rare. This leads to the following design: First, compute
    the Sturm count by the fast but unsafe algorithm. Then, if an
    exception occured, recompute the count by a safe, slower alternative.
    
    The new Sturm count algorithms improve the speed of bisection by up to
    2x on our test matrices. Furthermore, unlike the traditional
    tiny-pivot substitutions, proper use of IEEE-754 features provides a
    careful formulation that imposed no input range restrictions.",

    A four-parameter fit is developed for the class of integrals known as

    valid over the complete domain of the function (compact) and is
    everywhere accurate to within $\pm 0.0052\%$ when evaluating the first
    exponential integral, $E_1$. To achieve this result, a methodology
    that makes use of analytically known limiting behaviors at either
    extreme of the domain is employed. Because the fit accurately captures
    limiting behaviors of the $E_1$ function, more accuracy is retained
    when the fit is used as part of the scheme to evaluate higher-order
    exponential integrals, $E_n$, as compared with the use of brute-force
    fits to $E_1$, which fail to accurately model limiting
    behaviors. Furthermore, because the fit is compact, no special
    accommodations are required (as in the case of spliced piecewise fits)
    to smooth the value, slope, and higher derivatives in the transition

    This thesis is concerned with calculating polynomial greatest common
    divisors using straight line program representation.

    In the Introduction chapter, we introduce the problem and describe
    some of the traditional representations for polynomials, we then talk
    about some of the general subjects central to the thesis, terminating
    with a synopsis of the category theory which is central to the Axiom
    computer algebra system used during this research.

    The second chapter is devoted to describing category theory. We follow
    with a chapter detailing the important sections of computer code
    written in order to investigate the straight line program subject.
    The following chapter on evalution strategies and algorithms which are
    dependant on these follows, the major algorith which is dependant on
    evaluation and which is central to our theis being that of equality
    checking. This is indeed central to many mathematical problems.
    Interpolation, that is the determination of coefficients of a
    polynomial is the subject of the next chapter. This is very important
    for many straight line program algorithms, as their non-canonical
    structure implies that it is relatively difficult to determine
    coefficients, these being the basic objects that many algorithms work
    on. We talk about three separate interpolation techniques and compare
    their advantages and disadvantages. The final two chapters describe
    some of the results we have obtained from this research and finally
    conclusions we have drawn as to the viability of the straight line
    program approach and possible extensions.

    Finally we terminate with a number of appendices discussing side

    (Co)Inductive Constructions (CIC) implemented in the interactive
    theorem prover Matita. The refinement algorithm is in charge of giving
    a meaning to the terms, types and proof terms directly written by the
    user or generated by using tactics, decision procedures or general
    automation. The terms are written in an 'external syntax' meant to be
    user friendly that allows omission of information, untyped binders and
    a certain liberal use of user defined sub-typing. The refiner modifies
    the terms to obtain related well typed terms in the internal syntax
    understood by the kernel of the ITP. In particular, it acts as a type
    inference algorithm when all the binders are untyped. The proposed
    algorithm is bi-directional: given a term in external syntax and a
    type expected for the term, it propagates as much typing information
    as possible towards the leaves of the term. Traditional
    mono-directional algorithms, instead, proceed in a bottom-up way by
    inferring the type of a sub-term and comparing (unifying) it with the
    type expected by its context only at the end. We propose some novel
    bi-directional rules for CIC that are particularly effective. Among
    the benefits of bi-directionality we have better error message
    reporting and better inference of dependent types. Moreover, thanks to
    bi-directionality, the coercion system for sub-typing is more
    effective and type inference generates simpler unification problems
    that are more likely to be solved by the inherently incomplete higher
    order unification algorithms implemented. Finally we introduce in the
    external syntax the notion of vector of placeholders that enables to
    omit at once an arbitrary number of arguments. Vectors of placeholders
    allow a trivial implementation of implicit arguments and greatly
    simplify the implementation of primitive and simple tactics.",

  abstract =
    "Most working engineers view machine-checked mathematical proofs as an
    academic curiosity, if they have ever heard of the concept at all. In
    contrast, activities like testing, debugging, and code review are
    accepted as essential. They are woven into the lives of nearly all
    developers. In this talk, I will explain how I see machine-checked
    proofs enabling new everyday activities for developers of computer
    software and hardware. These activities have the potential to lower
    development effort dramatically, at the same time as they increase our
    assurance that systems behave correctly and securely. I will give a
    cosmological overview of this field, answering the FAQs that seem to
    stand in the way of practicality; and I will illustrate the principles
    with examples from projects that you can clone from GitHub today,
    covering the computing stack from digital hardware design to
    cryptographic software and applications.
    
    Today's developers of computer software and hardware are tremendously
    effective, compared to their predecessors. We have found very
    effective ways of modularizing and validating our work. The talk is
    about ammunition for these activities from a perhaps-unexpected
    source.
    
    Modularity involves breaking a complex system into a hierarchy of
    simpler pieces, which may be written and understood
    separately. Structured programming (e.g., using loops and conditionals
    instead of gotos) helps us read and understand parts of a single
    function in isolation, and data abstraction lets us encapsulate
    important functionality in objects, with guarantees that other code
    can only access the private data by calling public methods. That way,
    we can convince ourselves that the encapsulated code upholds certain
    essential properties, regardless of which other code it is linked
    with. Systematic unit testing also helps enforce contracts for units
    of modularity. Each of these techniques can be rerun automatically, to
    catch regressions in evolving systems, and catch those regressions in
    a way that accurately points the finger of responsibility to
    particular modules.
    
    Validation is an important part of development that encompasses
    testing, debugging, code review, and anything else that we do to raise
    our confidence that the system behaves as intended. Experienced
    engineers know that validation tends to take up the majority of
    engineering effort. Often that effort involves mentally taxing
    activities that would not otherwise come up in coding. One example is
    thinking about test-case coverage, and another is including
    instrumentation that produces traces to consult during debugging.
    
    It is not hard for working developers to imagine great productivity
    gains from better ways to break systems into pieces or raise our
    confidence in those pieces. The claim I will make in this talk is that
    a key source of such insights has been neglected: machine-checked
    mathematical proofs. Here the basic functionality is an ASCII language
    for defining mathematical objects, stating theorems about them, and
    giving proofs of theorems. Crucially, an algorithm checks that
    purported proofs really do establish the theorems. By going about
    these activities in the style of programming, we inherit usual
    supporting tools like IDEs, version control, continuous integration,
    and automated build processes. But how could so esoteric a task as
    math proofs call for that kind of tooling, and what does it have to do
    with building real computer systems?
    
    I will explain a shared vision to that end, developed along with many
    other members of my research community. Let me try to convince you
    that all of the following goals are attainable in the next 10 years.
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We will have complete computer systems implementing moderately
    complex network servers for popular protocols, proved to implement
    those protocols correctly, from the level of digital circuits on
    up. We will remove all deployed code (hardware or software) from the
    trusted computing base, shifting our trust to much smaller
    specifications and proof checkers.
    \item Hobbyists will be able to design new embedded computing
    platforms by mixing and matching open-source hardware and software
    components, also mixing and matching the proofs of these components,
    guaranteeing no bugs at the digital-abstraction level or higher, with
    no need for debugging.
    \item New styles of library design will be enabled by the chance to
    attach a formal behavioral specification to each library. For
    instance, rank-and-file programmers will able to assemble their own
    code for cryptographic protocols, with code that looks like reference
    implementations in Python, but getting performance comparable to what
    experts handcraft in assembly today. Yet that benefit would come with
    no need to trust that library authors have avoided bugs or intentional
    backdoors, perhaps even including automatic proofs of cryptographic
    security properties.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Main technical topics to cover to explain my optimism:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The basic functionality of proof assistants and why we should
    trust their conclusions
    \item How to think about system decomposition with specifications and
    proofs, including why, for most components, we do not need to worry
    about specification mistakes

    engineering up to speed with more traditional engineering disciplines,
    providing a mathematical foundation for rigorous analysis of realistic
    computer systems. As civil engineers apply their mathematical canon to
    reach high certainty that bridges will not fall down, the software
    engineer should apply a different canon to argue that programs behave
    properly. As other engineering disciplines have their computer-aided
    design tools, computer science has proof assistants, IDEs for logical
    arguments. We will learn how to apply these tools to certify that
    programs behave as expected.

    operators can be overloaded and information that can be deduced is

    Software applications that have to deal with formulae usually avoid
    these issues by fixing an unambiguous input notation. This solution is
    annoying for mathematicians because of the resulting tricky syntaxes
    and becomes a show stopper to the simultaneous adoption of tools
    characterized by different input languages.
    
    In this paper we present an efficient algorithm suitable for ambiguous
    parsing of mathematical formulae. The only requirement of the
    algorithm is the existence of a 'validity' predicate over abstract
    syntax trees of incomplete formulae with placeholders. This

  abstract =
    "The design of a module system for constructing and maintaining
    large programs is a difficult task that raises a number of theoretical
    and practical issues.  A fundamental issue is the management of the
    flow of information between program units at compile time via the
    notion of an interface.  Experience has shown that fully opaque
    interfaces are awkward to use in practice since too much
    information is hidden, and that fully transparent interfaces lead to
    excessive interdependencies, creating problems for maintenance
    and separate compilation.  The ``sharing'' specications of Standard ML
    address this issue by allowing the programmer to specify equational
    relationships between types in separate modules, but are not
    expressive enough to allow the programmer complete control over
    the propagation of type information between modules.
    
    These problems are addressed from a type-theoretic viewpoint by
    considering a calculus based on Girard's system $F_\omega$.  The calculus
    differs from those considered in previous studies by relying exclusively
    on a new form of weak sum type to propagate information at
    compile-time, in contrast to approaches based on strong sums which
    rely on substitution.  The new form of sum type allows for the 
    specification of equational, as well as type and kind, information
    in interfaces.  This provides complete control over the propagation
    of compile-time information between program units and is
    sufficient to encode in a straightforward way most uses of type
    sharing specifications in Standard ML.  Modules are treated as 
    ``first-class'' citizens, and therefore the system supports 
    higher-order modules and some object-oriented programming idioms: the
    language may be easily restricted to ``second-class' modules found in
    ML-like languages.",

    "This thesis presents algebraic and combinatorial approaches for
    reasoning about imperative loops with assignments, sequencing and
    conditionals.

    A certain family of loops, called P-solvable , is defined for which
    the value of each program variable can be expressed as a polynomial of
    the initial values of variables, the loop counter, and some new
    variables where there are algebraic dependencies among the new
    variables.  For such loops, a systematic method is developed for
    generating polynomial invariants.  Further, if the bodies of these
    loops consist only of assignments and conditional branches, and test
    conditions in the loop and conditionals are ignored, the method is
    shown to be complete for some special cases.  By completeness we mean
    that it generates a set of polynomials from which, under additional
    assumptions for loops with conditional branches, any polynomial
    invariant can be derived. Many non-trivial algorithms working on
    numbers can be naturally implemented using P-solvable loops.

    By combining advanced techniques from algorithmic combinatorics,
    symbolic summation, computer algebra and computational logic, a
    framework is developed for generating polynomial invariants for
    imperative programs operating on numbers.

    Exploiting the symbolic manipulation capabilities of the computer
    algebra system Mathematica , these techniques are implemented in a new
    software package called Aligator .  By using several combinatorial
    packages developed at RISC, Aligator includes algorithms for solving
    special classes of recurrence relations (those that are either
    Gosper-summable or C-finite) and generating polynomial dependencies
    among algebraic exponential sequences. Using Aligator , a complete set
    of polynomial invariants is successfully generated for numerous
    imperative programs working on numbers.

    The automatically obtained invariant assertions are subsequently used
    for proving the partial correctness of programs by generating
    appropriate verification conditions as first-order logical formulas.
    Based on Hoare logic and the weakest precondition strategy, this
    verification process is supported in an imperative verification
    environment implemented in the Theorema system.  Theorema is
    convenient for such an integration given that it is built on top of
    the computer algebra system Mathematica and includes automated methods
    for theorem proving in predicate logic, domain specific reasoning and
    proving by induction.",

    combination of first-order theories of data structures, the talk
    also discusses new features in first-order theorem proving, such as
    inductive reasoning and built-in boolean sort. These extensions allow

    "In recent years, proof assistants have reached an impressive level
    of maturity. They have led to the certification of complex
    programs such as compilers and operating systems. Yet, using a
    proof assistant requires highly specialised skills and it remains
    very different from standard programming. To bridge this gap, we
    aim at designing an ML-style programming language with support for
    proofs of programs, combining in a single tool the flexibility of
    ML and the fine specification features of a proof assistant. In
    other words, the system should be suitable both for programming
    (in the strongly-typed, functional sense) and for gradually
    increasing the level of guarantees met by programs, on a by-need
    basis.

    We thus define and study a call-by-value language whose type
    system extends higher-order logic with an equality type over
    untyped programs, a dependent function type, classical logic and
    subtyping. The combination of call-by-value evaluation, dependent
    functions and classical logic is known to raise consistency
    issues. To ensure the correctness of the system (logical
    consistency and runtime safety), we design a theoretical framework
    based on Krivine's classical realisability. The construction of
    the model relies on an essential property linking the different
    levels of interpretation of types in a novel way.

    We finally demonstrate the expressive power of our system using
    our prototype implementation, by proving properties of standard
    programs like the map function on lists or the insertion sort.",

    subtyping based on a set C of basic subtyping judgements, and show

    the other. We also compare coercive subtyping with the ‘ordinary’

    be a full scale system for foralizing intuitionistic mathematics as
    developed, for example, in the book by Bishop 1967. The language of
    the theory is richer than the language of first order predicate
    logic. This makes it possible to strengthen the axioms for existence
    and disjunction. In the case of existence, the possibility of
    strengthening the usual elimination rule seems first to have been
    indicated by Howard 1969, whose proposed axioms are special cases of
    the existential elimination rule of the present theory. Furthermore,
    there is a reflection principle which links the generation of objects
    and types and plays somewhat the same role for the present theory as
    does the replacement axiom for Zermelo-Frankel set theory.
    
    An earlier, not yet conclusive, attempt at formulating a theory of
    this kind was made by Scott 1970. Also related, although less closely,
    are the type and logic free theories of consructions of Kreisel 1962
    and 1965 and Goodman 1970.
    
    In its first version, the present theory was based on the strongly
    impredicative axiom that there is a type of all types whatsoever,
    which is at the same time a type and an object of that type. This
    axiom had to be abandoned, however, after it was shown to lead to a
    contradiction by Jean Yves Girard. I am very grateful to him for
    showing me his paradox. The change that it necessitated is so drastic
    that my theory no longer contains intuitionistic simple type theory as
    it originally did. Instead, its proof theoretic strength should be
    close to that of predicative analysis.",

    mathematics. This explains why the intuitionistic theory of types,
    which was originally developed as a symbolism for the precise
    codification of constructive mathematics, may equally well be viewed
    as a programming language. As such it provides a precise notation not
    only, like other programming languages, for the programs themselves
    but also for the tasks that the programs are supposed to
    perform. Moreover, the inference rules of the theory of types, which
    are again completely formal, appear as rules of correct program
    synthesis. Thus the correctness of a program written in the theory of
    types is proved formally at the same time as it is being
    synthesized.",

  link = "\url{http://strictlypositive.org/thesis.pdf}",
  abstract =
    "Research in dependent type theories has, in the past, concentrated on
    its use in the presentation of theorems and theorem-proving. This
    thesis is concerned mainly with the exploitation of the computational
    aspects of type theory for programming, in a context where the
    properties of programs may readily be specified and established. In
    particular, it develops technology for programming with dependent
    inductive families of datatypes and proving those programs correct. It
    demonstrates the considerable advantage to be gained by indexing data
    structures with pertinent characteristic information whose soundness
    is ensured by typechecking, rather than human effort.
    
    Type theory traditionally presents safe and terminating computation on
    inductive datatypes by means of elimination rules which serve as
    induction principles and, via their associated reduction behaviour,
    recursion operators. In the programming language arena, these appear
    somewhat cumbersome and give rise to unappealing code, complicated by
    the inevitable interaction between case analysis on dependent types
    and equational reasoning on their indices which must appear explicitly
    in the terms. Thierry Coquand's proposal to equip type theory directly
    with the kind of pattern matching notation to which functional
    programmers have become used to over the past three decades offers a
    remedy to many of these difficulties. However, the status of pattern
    matching relative to the traditional elimination rules has until now
    been in doubt. Pattern matching implies the uniqueness of identity
    proofs, which Martin Hofmann showed underivable from the conventiaonal
    definition of equality. This thesis shows that the adoption of this
    uniqueness as axiomatic is sufficient to make pattern matching
    admissible.
    
    A datatype's elimination rule allows abstraction only over the whole
    inductively defined family. In order to support pattern matching, the
    application of such rules to specific instances of dependent families
    has been systematised. The underlying analysis extends beyond
    datatypes to other rules of a similar second order character,
    suggesting they may have other roles to play in the specification,
    verification and, perhaps, derivation of programs. The technique
    developed shifts the specificity from the instantiation of the type's
    indices into equational constraints on indices freely chosen, allowing
    the elimination rule to be applied.
    
    Elimination by this means leaves equational hypotheses in the
    resulting subgoals, which must be solved if further progress is to be
    made. The first-order unification algorithm for constructor forms in
    simmple types presented in [McB96] has been extended to cover
    dependent datatypes as well, yielding completely automated solution of
    a class of problems which can be syntactically defined.
    
    The justification and operation of these techniques requires the
    machine to construct and exploit a standardised collection of
    auxiliary lemmas for each datatype. This is greatly facilitated by two
    technical developments of interest in their own right:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a more convenient definition of equality, with a relaxed
    formulation rule allowing elements of different types to be compared,
    but nonetheless equivalent to the usual equality plus the axiom of
    uniqueness
    \item a type theory, OLEG, which incorporates incomplete objects,
    accounting for their 'holes' entirely within the typing judgments and,
    novelly, not requiring any notion of explicit substitution to manage
    their scopes.
    \end{itemize}
    
    A substantial prototype has been implemented, extending the proof
    assistant LEGO. A number of programs are developed by way of
    example. Chiefly, the increased expressivity of dependent datatypes is
    shown to capture a standard first-order unification algorithm within
    the class of structurally recursive programs, removing any need for a
    termination argument. Furthermore, the use of elimination rules in
    specifying the components of the program simplifies significantly its
    correctness proof.",

  abstract =
    "Statically typed programming languages allow earlier error
    checking, better enforcement of disciplined programming styles,
    and generation of more efficient object code than languages where
    all type consistency checks are performed at run time. However,
    even in statically typed languages, there is often the need to
    deal with data whose type cannot be determined at compile time. To
    handle such situations safely, we propose to add a type Dynamic
    whose values are pairs of a value $v$ and a type tag T where $v$
    has the type denoted by T. Instances of Dynamic are built with an
    explicit tagging construct and inspected with a type safe typecase
    construct. 

    This paper explores the syntax, operational semantics, and
    denotational semantics of a simple language including the type
    Dynamic. We give examples of how dynamically typed values can be
    used in programming. Then we discuss an operational semantics for
    our language and obtain a soundness theorem. We present two
    formulations of the denotational semantics of this language and
    relate them to the operational semantics. Finally, we consider the
    implications of polymorphism and some implementation issues.",

    contributed to the empirical success of objects, and if so, how?

    This essay attempts to answer that question. After reviewing
    Cook's definition, I propose the term {\sl service abstractions}
    to capture the essential nature of objects. This terminology
    emphasizes, following Kay, that objects are not primarily about
    representing and manipulating data, but are more about providing
    services in support of higher-level goals. Using examples taken
    from object oriented frameworks, I illustrate the unique design
    leverage that service abstractions provide: the ability to define
    abstractions that can be extended, and whose extensions are
    interoperable in a first-class way. The essay argues that the form
    of interoperable extension supported by service abstractions is
    essential to modern software: many modern frameworks and
    ecosystems could not have been built without service
    abstractions. In this sense, the success of objects was not a
    coincidence: it was an inevitable consequence of their service
    abstraction nature.",

    "Given a tower of interpreters, i.e., a sequence of multiple
    interpreters interpreting one another as input programs, we aim to
    collapse this tower into a compiler that removes all interpretive
    overhead and runs in a single pass. In the real world, a use case
    might be Python code executed by an x86 runtime, on a CPU emulated
    in a JavaScript VM, running on an ARM CPU. Collapsing such a tower
    can not only exponentially improve runtime performance, but also
    enable the use of base language tools for interpreted programs,
    e.g. for analysis and verification. In this paper, we lay the
    foundations in an idealized but realistic setting.

    We present a multi-level lambda calculus that features staging
    constructs and stage polymorphism: based on runtime parameters, an
    evaluator either executes source code (thereby acting as an
    interpreter) or generates code (thereby acting as a compiler). We
    identify stage polymorphism, a programming model from the domain
    of high-performance program generators, as the key mechanism to
    make such interpreters compose in a collapsible way.

    We present Pink, a meta-circular Lisp-like evaluator on top of
    this calculus, and demonstrate that we can collapse arbitrarily
    many levels of self-interpretation, including levels with
    semantics modifications. We discuss several examples: compiling
    regular expressions through an interpreter to base code, building
    program transformers from modified interpreters, and others. We
    develop these ideas further to include reflection and reification,
    culminating in Purple, a reflective language inspired by Brown,
    Blond, and Black, which realizes a conceptually infinite tower,
    where every aspect of the semantics can change
    dynamically. Addressing an open challenge, we show how user
    programs can be compiled and recompiled under user-modified
    semantics.",

    typically prose and pseudocode documents, not rigorous or executable
    artifacts, leaving software and verification on shaky ground.
    
    In this paper, we present rigorous semantic models for the sequential
    behaviour of large parts of the mainstream ARMv8-A, RISC-V, and MIPS
    architectures, and the research CHERI-MIPS architecture, that are
    complete enough to boot operating systems, variously Linux, FreeBSD,
    or seL4. Our ARMv8-A models are automatically translated from
    authoritative ARM-internal definitions, and (in one variant) tested
    against the ARM Architecture Validation Suite.
    
    We do this using a custom language for ISA semantics, Sail, with a
    lightweight dependent type system, that supports automatic generation
    of emulator code in C and OCaml, and automatic generation of
    proof-assistant definitions for Isabelle, HOL4, and (currently only
    for MIPS) Coq. We use the former for validation, and to assess
    specification coverage. To demonstrate the usability of the latter, we
    prove (in Isabelle) correctness of a purely functional
    characterisation of ARMv8-A address translation. We moreover integrate
    the RISC-V model into the RMEM tool for (user-mode) relaxed-memory
    concurrency exploration. We prove (on paper) the soundness of the core
    Sail type system.
    
    We thereby take a big step towards making the architectural
    abstraction actually well-defined, establishing foundations for

    the prototype was used by a user group to test their reactions to
    the language. As time passed many features were added (and
    removed) from the interpreter and eventually the language reached
    a level of maturity where it was decided to try it out on a
    significant problem.

    About 3 years and some 20,000 lines of Erlang later, performance
    became an issue -- we wrote Prolog cross compilers from Erlang to
    various concurrent logic programming languages followed by a
    direct implementation of Erlang itself. The direct implementation
    of Erlang was loosely based on the WAM and made by writing a
    Prolog compiler from Erlang to a new abstractmachine and an
    emulator for the abstract machine in 'C'. The instruction set for
    the abstract machine was first prototyped in Prolog -- finally the
    compiler was re-written in Erlang, thus totally removing any
    dependency on Prolog.

    superimpose a labelled hierarchical nesting on an ordinary proof
    tree. The labels and nesting are used to describe the organisation
    of the proof, typically relating to its construction process. This
    can be useful for understanding and navigating the proof. Tactics
    in our language construct hiproof structure together with an
    underlying proof tree. We provide both a big-step and a small-step
    operational semantics for evaluating tactic expressions. The
    big-step semantics captures the intended meaning, whereas the
    small-step semantics hints at possible implementations and
    provides a unified notion of proof state. We prove that these

    non-numeric objects (NaNs), signed zeros, denormal numbers,
    different rounding modes... One possibility to reason about
    floating-point arithmetic is to model a program computation path
    by means of a set of ternary constraints of the form $z=x op y$
    and use constraint propagation techniques to infer new information
    on the variables' possible values. In this setting, we define and
    prove the correctness of algorithms to precisely bound the value
    of one of the variables $x$, $y$, or $z$, starting from the bounds
    known for the other two. We do this for each of the operations and
    for each rounding mode defined by the IEEE 754 binary
    floating-point standard, even in the case the rounding mode in
    effect is only partially known. This is the first time that such
    so-called filtering algorithms are defined and their correctness

  abstract =
    "Common Lisp [CL84,CL90] includes a dynamic datatype system of
    moderate complexity, as well as predicates for checking the types of
    language objects. Additionally, an interesting predicate of two 'type
    specifiers'— SUBTYPEP —is included in the language. This subtypep
    predicate provides a mechanism with which to query the Common Lisp
    type system regarding containment relations among the various built-in
    and user-defined types. While subtypep is rarely needed by an
    applications programmer, the efficiency of a Common Lisp
    implementation can depend critically upon the quality of its subtypep
    predicate: the run-time system typically calls upon subtypep to decide
    what sort of representations to use when making arrays; the compiler
    calls upon subtypep to interpret user declarations, on which efficient
    data representation and code generation decisions are based.

    As might be expected due to the complexity of the Common Lisp type
    system, there may be type containment questions which cannot be
    decided. In these cases subtypep is expected to return 'can't
    determine', in order to avoid giving an incorrect
    answer. Unfortunately, most Common Lisp implementations have abused
    this license by answering 'can't determine' in all but the most
    trivial cases. In particular, most Common Lisp implementations of
    SUBTYPEP fail on the basic axioms of the Common Lisp type system
    itself [CL84,p.33]. This situation is particularly embarrassing for
    Lisp—the premier 'symbol processing language'—in which the
    implementation of complex symbolic logical operations should be
    relatively easy. Since subtypep was presumably included in Common Lisp
    to answer the hard cases of type containment, this 'lazy evaluation'
    limits the usefulness of an important language feature.

    This paper shows how those type containment relations of Common Lisp
    which can be decided at all, can be decided simply and quickly by a
    decision procedure which can dramatically reduce the number of
    occurrences of the 'can't determine' answer from subtypep . This
    decision procedure does not require the conversion of a type specifier
    expression to conjunctive or disjunctive normal form, and therefore
    does not incur the exponential explosion in space and time that such a
    conversion would entail.

    The lattice mechanism described here for deciding subtypep is also
    ideal for performing type inference [Baker90]; the particular
    implementation developed here, however, is specific to the type system
    of Common Lisp [Beer88].",

  abstract =
    "The mathematicians' Digital mathematics library (DML), which is
    not to be confused with libraries of mathematical objects
    represented in some digital format, is the generous idea that all
    mathematics ever published should end up in digital form so that
    it would be more easily referenced, accessible, usable. This
    concept was formulated at the very beginning of this century, and
    yielded a lot of international activity that culminated around
    years 2002-2005. While it is estimated that a substantial part of
    the existing math literature is already available in some digital
    format, nothing looking like one digital mathematics library has
    emerged, but a multiplicity of competing electronic offers, with
    unique standards, features, business models, access policies,
    etc. -- even though the contents themselves overlap somewhat,
    while leaving wide areas untouched. The millenium's applealing
    idea has become a new Tower of Babel.

    It is not obvious how much of the traditional library functions we
    should give up while going digital. The point of view shared by
    many mathematicians is that we should be able to find a reasonable
    archiving policy fitting all stakeholders, allowing to translate
    the essential features of the past library system -- which is the
    central infrastructure of all math departments worldwide -- in the
    digital paradigm, while enhancing overall performances thanks to
    dedicated information technology.

    The vision of this library is rather straightforward: a third
    party to the academic publishing system, preserving, indexing, and
    keeping current its digital collections through a distributed
    network of partners curating the physical holdings, and a
    centralized access facility making use of innovative mining and
    interlinking techniques for easy navigation and discovery.

    However, the fragmentation level is so high that the hope of a
    unique portal providing seamless access to everything relevant to
    mathematical research seems now completely out of reach. 
    Nevertheless, we have lessons to learn from each one of the
    already numerous projects running. One of them is that there are
    too many items to deal with, and too many different inital choices
    over metadata sets and formats: it won't be possible to find a
    nontrivial greatest common divisor coping with everything already
    available, and manual upgrading is highly improbable.

    This is where future management techniques for loosely formalised
    mathematical knowledge could provide a new impetus by at last
    enabling a minimum set of features across projects borders through
    automated procedures. We can imagine e.g. math-aware OCR on
    scanned pages, concurrently with interpreters of electronic
    sources of born digital texts, both producing searchable full
    texts in a compatible semistructured format. The challenge is
    ultimately to take advantage of the high formalisation of
    mathematical texts rather than merely ignoring it!

    With these considerations in mind, the talk will focus on
    achievements, limitations, and failures of existing digital
    mathematics libraries, taking the NUMDAM and CEDRAM programs as
    principal examples, hence the speaker himself is the target.",

  abstract = 
    "Types express a program’s meaning, and checking types ensures that a
    program has the intended meaning. In a dependently typed programming
    language types are predicated on values, leading to the possibility of
    expressing invariants of a program’s behaviour in its type. Dependent
    types allow us to give more detailed meanings to programs, and hence
    be more confident of their correctness.  
    
    This thesis considers the practical implementation of a dependently
    typed programming language, using the Epigram notation defined by
    McBride and McKinna.  Epigram is a high level notation for dependently
    typed functional programming elaborating to a core type theory based
    on Luo’s UTT, using Dybjer’s inductive families and elimination rules
    to implement pattern matching. This gives us a rich framework for
    reasoning about programs.  However, a na ̈ıve implementation introduces
    several run-time overheads since the type sys- tem blurs the
    distinction between types and values; these overheads include the
    duplication of values, and the storage of redundant information and
    explicit proofs.
    
    A practical implementation of any programming language should be as
    efficient as pos- sible; in this thesis we see how the apparent
    efficiency problems of dependently typed pro- gramming can be overcome
    and that in many cases the richer type information allows us to apply
    optimisations which are not directly available in traditional
    languages. I introduce three storage optimisations on inductive
    families; forcing, detagging and collapsing. I further introduce a
    compilation scheme from the core type theory to G-machine code,
    including a pattern matching compiler for elimination rules and a
    compilation scheme for efficient run- time implementation of Peano’s
    natural numbers. We also see some low level optimisations for removal
    of identity functions, unused arguments and impossible case branches.
    As a result, we see that a dependent type theory is an effective base
    on which to build a feasible programming language.",

    case, but the actual computation time can vary greatly. It is
    possible to offer different formulations for a given problem
    leading to great differences in tractability. In this paper we
    suggest a new measure for CAD complexity which takes into account
    the real geometry of the problem. This leads to new heuristics for
    choosing: the variable ordering for a CAD problem, a designated
    equational constraint, and formulations for truth-table invariant

  abstract = 
    "Since Risch (1969) reduced the problem of integrating
    exponentials to solving a first order linear differntial equation
    in a differential field, there has been considerable interest in
    solving \[y^\prime + fy = g\] for $y$ in a given differential
    field $K$, where $f,g\in K$. Risch (1969) gave an algorithm for a
    more general equation. His algorithm, however, required factoring
    the denominators of $f$ and $g$, which is an obstacle to efficient
    implementations. 

    Later, Rothstein (1976) and Davenport (1986) presented algorithms
    for equation $(R)$ that both rely on a squarefree factorization of
    the denominator for $y$. The algorithm in (Davenport 1986) has
    been implemented in the Scratchpad II (see Jenks et al.) and Maple
    (see Char et al, 1985) computer algebra systems. This algorithm,
    however, requires $f$ to be in a certain form (called {\sl weakly
    normalized}), but no computer algorithm that makes $f$ weakly
    normalized has been published.

    We present here a weaker definition of weak-normality, which
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item can always be obtained in a tower of transcendental
    elementary extensions,
    \item gives us an explicit formula for the denominator of $y$, so
    equation $(R)$ can be reduced to a polynomial equation in one
    reduction step
    \end{enumerate}

    As a consequence, we obtain a new algorithm for solving equation
    $(R)$. OUr algorithm is very similar to the one described in
    Rothstein (1976), except that we use weak normality to prevent
    finite cancellation, rather than having to find integer roots of
    polynomials over the constant field of $K$ in order to detect it.",

    "We are developing an optimizing compiler for a dialect of the
    LISP language. The current target architecture is the S-1, a
    multiprocessing supercomputer designed at Lawrence Livermore
    National Laboraty. While LISP is usually thought of as a language
    primarily for symbolic processing and list manipulation, this
    compiler is also intended to compete with the S-1 PASCAL and
    FORTRAN compilers for quality of compiled numerical code. The S-1
    is designed for extremely high-speed signal processing as well as
    for symbolic computation; it provides primitive operations on
    vectors of floating-point and complex numbers. The LISP compiler
    is designed to exploit the architecture heavily.

    The compiler is structurally and conceptually similar to the
    BLISS-11 compiler and the compilers produced by PQCC. In
    particular, the TNBIND technique has been borrowed and extended. 

    Particularly interesting properties of the compiler are:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Extensive use of source-to-source transformation
    \item Use of an intermediate form that is expression-oriented
    rather than statement oriented
    \item Exploitation of tail-recursive function calls to represent
    coplex control structures
    \item Efficient compilation of code that can manipulate procedural
    object that require heap-allocated environments
    \item Smooth run-time interfacing between the ``numerical world''
    and ``LISP pointer world'', including automatic stack allocation
    of objects that ordinarlly must be heap-allocated
    \end{itemize}

    Each of these techniques has been used before, but we believe
    their synthesis to be original and unique.

    The compiler is table-driven to a great extent, more so than
    BLISS-11 but less so than a PQCC compiler. We expect to be able to
    redirect the compiler to other target architectures such as the
    VAX or PDP-10 with relatively little effort.",

  abstract =
    "This paper reports preliminary work on a novel approach to
    Coercive Subtyping that is based on relationships between
    reduction behaviour of source and target types in coerced
    terms. Coercive subtyping is a subset of record-based subtyping,
    allowing so-called coercion functions to carry the subtyping. This
    allows many novel and powerful forms of subtyping and
    abbreviation, with applicaions including interfaces to theorem
    provers and programming with dependent type systems. However, the
    use of coercion functions introduces non-trivial overheads, and
    requires difficult proof of properties such as coherence in order
    to guarantee sensible results. These points restrict the
    practicality of coercive subtyping. We begin with the idea that
    coercing a value $v$ from type $U$ to a type %T% intuitively means
    that we wish to compute with $v$ as if it was a value in $T$, not
    that $v$ must be converted into a value in $T$. Instead, we
    explore how to compute on $U$ in terms of computation on $T$, and
    develop a framework for mapping computations on some $T$ on
    computations on some $U$ via a simple extension of the elimination
    rule of $T$. By exposing how computations on different types are
    relatd, we gain insight on and make progress with several aspects
    of coercive subtyping, including (a) distinguishing classes of
    coercion and finding reasons to deprecate use of some classes; (b)
    alternative techniques for improving key properties of coercions;
    (c) greater efficiency from implementations of coercions.",

    not incompatible with relational and concurrent programming.

    The main purpose of this paper is to show how typeful programming
    is best supported by sophisticated type systems, and how these
    systems can help in clarifying programming issues and in adding
    power and regularity to languages.

    We start with an introduction to the notions of types, subtypes
    and polymorphism. Then we introduce a general framework, derived
    in part from constructive logic, into which most of the known type
    systems can be accommodated and extended. The main part of the
    paper shows how this framework can be adapted systematically to
    cope with actual programming constructs. For concreteness we
    describe a particular programming language with advanced features;
    the emphasis here is on the combination of subtyping and
    polymorphism. We then discuss how typing concepts apply to large
    programs. We also sketch how typing applies to system programming;
    an area which by nature escapes rigid typing. In summary, we
    compare the most common programming styles, suggesting that many

    algorithms which are a direct generalization of Euclid's
    algorithm. The main algorithms of this type are the Reduced PRS
    algorithm and the Subresultant PRS algorithm. Hearn discusses the
    use of trial divisions to further improve the performance of PRS
    algorithms. The first fundamentally different polynomial GCD
    algorithm was the modular algorithm. To amek the modular algorithm
    competative for sparse multivariate polynomals, Zippel developed
    the sparse modular algorithm. Another modular-type algorithm was
    the Hensel-based EZ GCD algorithm which was later improved as the
    EEZ GCD algorithm.

    the present paper discusses a new heuristic algorithm, GCDHEU,

    of variables. The heuristic algorithm can be viewed as
    amodular-type algorithm in that it uses evaluation and

  abstract =
    "What makes a good compiler IR? In the context of functional
    languages, there has been an extensive debate on the advantages
    and disadvantages of continuation-passing style (CPS). The
    consensus seems to be that some form of explicit continuations is
    necessary to model jumps in a functional style, but that they
    should have a 2nd-class status, separate from regular functions,
    to ensure efficient code generation. Building on this observation,
    a recent study from PLDI 2017 proposed a direct-style IR with
    explicit join points, which essentially represent local
    continuations, i.e. functions that do not return or escape. While
    this IR can work well in practice, as evidenced by the
    implementation of join points in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
    (GHC), there still seems to be room for improvement, especially
    with regard to the way continuations are handled in the course of
    optimization. 

    In this paper, we contribute to the CPS debate by developing a
    novel IR with the following features. First, we integrate a
    control operator that resembles Felleisen's C, eliminating certain
    redundant rewrites observed in the previous study. Second, we
    treat the non-returning and non-escaping aspects of continuations
    separately, allowing efficient compilation of well-behaved
    functions defined by the user. Third, we define a selective CPS
    translation of our IR, which erases control operators while
    preserving the meaning and typing of programs. These features
    enable optimizations in both direct style and full CPS, as well as
    in any intermediate style with selectively exposed continuations. 
    Thus, we change the spectrum of available options from 'CPS yes or
    no' to 'as much or as little CPS as you want, when you want it'.",

    universal model computing machine operating by finite
    means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine,
    because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not
    obey the principle, at leeast in the strong form above. A class of
    model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the
    class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that
    quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer' are compatible
    with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal
    quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many
    remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing
    machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive
    functions, but they do include 'quantum parallelism', a method by
    which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a
    universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of
    it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an
    intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other
    than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the
    quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are

    way elements of such sets are generated. The formulation is in
    natural deduction and is intended to be a natural generalization
    to type theory of Martin-Lof's theory of iterated inductive
    definitions of predicate logic.

    Formal criteria are given for correct formation and introduction
    rules of a new set former capturing definition by strictly
    positive, iterated, generalized induction. Moreover, there is an
    inversion principle for deriving elimination and equality rules
    from the formation and introduction rules. Finally, there is an
    alternative schematic presentation of definition by recursion. 

    The resulting theory is a flexible and powerful language for
    programming and constructive mathematics. We hint at the wealth of
    possible applications by showing several basic examples: predicate
    logic, generalized induction, and a formalization of the untyped
    lambda calculus.",

    in the sense of the ADJ-group a new theory for algebraic

    While main concepts of this new theory were given already at
    several conferences this paper provides the full theory of
    algebraic implementations developed in Berlin except of complexity
    considerations which are given in a separate paper. This new
    concept of algebraic implementations includes implementations for
    algorithms in specific programming languages and on the other hand
    it meets also the requirements for stepwise refinement of
    structured programs and software systems as introduced by Dijkstra
    and Wirth. On the syntactical level an algebraic implementation
    corresponds to a system of recursive programs while the semantical
    level is defined by algebraic constructions, called SYNTHESIS,
    RESTRICTION and IDENTIFICATION. Moreover the concept allows
    composition of implementations and a rigorous study of
    correctness. The main results of the paper are different kinds of
    correctness criteria which are applied to a number of illustrating
    examples including the implementation of sets by hash-tables.

    "Haskell, as implemented by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC),
    has been adding new type-level programming features for some
    time. Many of these features -- generalized algebraic datatypes
    (GADT)s, type families, kind polymorphism, and promoted datatypes
    -- have brought Haskell to the doorstep of dependent types. Many
    dependently typed programs can even currently be encoded, but
    often the constructions are painful.

    In this dissertation, I describe Dependent Haskell, which supports
    full dependent types via a backward-compatible extension to
    today's Haskell. An important contribution to this work is an
    implementation, in GHC, of a portion of Dependent Haskell, with
    the rest to follow. The features I have implemented are already
    released, in GHC 8.0. This dissertation contains several practical
    examples of Dependent Haskell code, a full description of the
    differences between Dependent Haskell and today's Haskell, a novel
    dependently typed lambda-calculus (called PICO) suitable for use
    as an intermediate language for compiling Dependent Haskell, and a
    type inference and elaboration algorithm, BAKE, that translates
    Dependent Haskell to type-correct PICO. Full proofs of type safety

  year = "2019",
  abstract =
    "Dependent types help programmers write highly reliable
    code. However, this reliability comes at a cost: it can be
    challenging to write new prototypes in (or migrate old code to)
    dependently-typed programming languages. Gradual typing makes
    static type disciplines more flexible, so an appropriate notion of
    gradual dependent types could fruitfully lower this cost. However,
    dependent types raise unique challenges for gradual
    typing. Dependent typechecking involves the execution of program
    code, but gradually-typed code can signal runtime type errors or
    diverge. These runtime errors threaten the soundness guarantees
    that make dependen types so attractive, while divergence spoils
    the type-driven programming experience.

    this paper presents GDTL, a gradual dependently-typed language
    that emphasizes pragmatic dependently-typed programming. GDTL
    fully embeds both an untyped and dependently-typed language, and
    allows for smooth transitions between the two. In addition to
    gradual types we introduce gradual terms, which allow the user to
    be imprecise in type indices and to omit proof terms; runtime
    checks ensure type safety. To account for nontermination and
    failure, we distinguish between compile-type normalization and
    run-time execution: compile-time normalization is approximate but
    total, while runtime execution is exact, but may fail or
    diverge. We prove that GDTL has decidable typechecking and
    satisfies all the expected properties of gradual languages. In
    particular, GDTL satisfies the static and dynamic gradual
    guarantees: reducing type precision preserves typedness, and
    altering type precision does not change program behavior outside
    of dynamic type failures. To prove these properties, we were led
    to establish a novel normalization gradual guarantee thata
    captures the monotonicity of approximate normalization with
    respect to imprecision.",

    mechanism for applying the algorithm to actual

    integrate reasoning about the synta of the expressions with
    reaoning about what the expressions mean. A syntax framework is a
    mathematical structure that is an abstract model for a syntax

    theory $T$. In the first approach the syntactic values for the
    expressions manipulated by the algorithm are members of an

    "The computation of a standard basis (also alled Groebner basis)
    of a multivariate polynomial ideal over a field $K$ is crucial in
    many appliations. The problem is intransically time and space
    consuming, and many researchers aim to improve the basic algorithm
    due to B. Buchberger [Bu1]. One has investigated the problem of
    the optimal choice of the term ordering depending from the use
    that has to be made of the results, [BS], and the systematic
    elimination of unnecessary reductions [Bu2],[GM],[Po]. We can call
    all these problems ``combinatorial complexity problems''.

    The present paper considers arithmetic complexity problems; our
    main problem is how to limit the growth of the coefficients in the
    algorithms and the complexity of the field operations
    involved. The problem is important with every ground field, with
    the obvious exception of finite fields.

    The ground field is often represented as the field of fractions of
    some explict domain, which is usually a quotient of a finite
    extension of $Z$, and the computations are hence reduced to these
    domains. 

    The problem of coefficient growth, and the complexity already
    appearing in the calculation of the GCD of tw univariate
    polynomials, which is indeed a very special case of standard basis
    computation; the PRS algorithms of Brown and Collins operate the
    partial coefficient simplifications predicted by a theorem, hence
    succeeding in controlling this complexity.

    Our approach looks for analogies with these algorithms, but a
    general structure theorem is missing, hence our approach relies on
    a limited seqrch of coefficient simplifications. The basic idea is
    the following: since the GCD is usually costly, we can use in its
    place the ``greatest between the common divisors that are easy to
    compute'' (the GECD), this suggestion allowing different
    instances. A set of such instances is based on the remark that if
    you hve elements in factorized form, then many common divisors are
    immediately evident. Since irreducible factorization, even
    assuming that is exists in our domain, is costly, we use a partial
    factorization basically obtained using a ``lazy multiplication''
    technique, i.e. performing coefficient multiplications only if
    they are unavoidable. The resulting algorithms were tested with a
    ``simulatied'' implementation on the integers, and the results
    suggest that a complete implementation should be very efficient,
    at least when the coefficient domain is a multivariate rational
    function field.",

    \item to each language is associated an algebraic abstract data type
    \item the semantic value of a program is given as a term of this
    data type
    \item the translation of the semantic values of source programs
    into semantic values of target programs is specified and proved as
    the representation of an algebrayc data type by another one.

    describe a heuristic method which can be used for many operations
    involving algebraic numbers. We gie specifics for doing algebraic
    number inverses, and algebraic number polynomial exact division
    and greatest common divisor calculation. The heurist will not
    solve all instances of these problems, but it returns either the
    correct result or with failure very quickly, and succeeds for a

    which the induction principle over natural numbers is not

    natural numbers that has been chosen (like e.g. polymorphic Church
    numerals), so in fact we prove that there can not be an encoding
    of natural numbers in $\lambda{}P2$ such that the induction
    principle is satisfied. The method extends immediately to other
    data types, like booleans, lists, trees, etc.

    program is correct with respect to those assertions.  An initial
    assertion characterizes conditions expected to be true upon entry to
    the program and a final assertion characterizes conditions expected to
    be true upon exit from the program.  When a program contains no
    branches, a technique known as symbolic execution can be used to show
    that the truth of the initial assertion upon entry guarantees the
    truth of the final assertion upon exit.  More generally, for a program
    with branches one can define a symbolic execution tree.  If there is
    an upper bound on the number of times each loop in such a program may
    be executed, a proof of correctness can be given by a simple traversal
    of the (finite) symbolic execution tree.
    
    However, for most programs, no fixed bound on the number of times each
    loop is executed exists and the corresponding symbolic execution trees
    are infinite.  In order to prove the correctness of such programs, a
    more general assertion structure must be provided.  The symbolic
    execution tree of such programs must be traversed inductively rather
    than explicitly.  This leads naturally to the use of additional
    assertions which are called ``inductive assertions.''",

    "Problem Statement: FriCAS a fork of Axiom project. Its starting
    point is wh-sandbox branch of the Axiom project. Axiom project
    tried to use literate programming methodology and switch emphasis
    from code to documentation. In practice that meants that almost
    all code is wrapped in so called pamhlet files and must be
    extracted by noweb tool before use in build process. This causes
    significant difficulties during developement, starting from having
    long file names, problems of tracking errors to exact source
    locations and complicationss in Makefiles. Literate programming
    practice in Axiom produced little documentation, but makes sources
    harder to read for programmer. FriCAS will use traditional
    methodology for new developement and gradually convert other files
    back to traditional form (back because Axiom was originally
    developed using traditional methodology, and only during
    transition to open source project files where mechanically
    converted to ``literate'' form). Axiom project evolved very
    slowly, many simple fixes were not applied for long time
    (years). FriCAS will use lightweight developement, allowing much
    faster evolution.

    Short term planned new technical developments: Axiom system is
    written in multiple languages, main two called Boot and Spad are
    specific to Axiom. Boot and Spad are translated to Common
    Lisp. Currently Axiom is fully functional when working on top of
    Gnu Common Lisp (GCL). In wh-sandbox branch core functionlity
    works also with other Lisp implementations, and FriCAS should
    fully support other Lisp implementations. This should increase
    acceptance of FriCAS, because on some platforms GCL is hard to
    build, on some does not work at all  and also Lisp developers
    frequently find other Lisp implementation preferable. The Spad
    language used for mathematical code in Axiom is strongly
    typed. Axiom system caches type information between builds --
    during build it uses type information from previous build. This
    makes modifications to Axiom code very difficult, because after
    changing type in source old type information is used in many
    cases, causing spurious type errors. FriCAS will use only type
    information from sources eliminationg such problems. Many modern
    mathematical codes to get better speed are written in C or
    C++. FriCAS will interface to such codes to gain speed
    advantage. Currently Axiom system offers its own user interface,
    but it is somewhat dated -- mostly text based,graphics has old
    looks and feel. FriCAS add hoos which make adding alternative user
    interfaces easier.

    Longer term plans: The compiler for Spad language included in
    Axiom is buggy and has serious performance problems -- new
    compiler is needed. New mathematical algorithms. Assertion
    support.",

    "In the last ten years declaration-free programming languages with
    a polymorphic typing discipline (ML, B) have been developed to
    approximate the flexibility and conciseness of dynamically typed
    languages (LISP, SETL) while retaining the safety and execution
    efficiency of conventional statically typed languages (Algol68,
    Pascal). These polymorphic languages can be type checked at
    compile time, yet allow functions whose arguments range over a
    variety of types.

    We investigate several polymorphic type systems, the most powerful
    of which, termed Milner-Mycroft Calculus, extends the so-called
    let-polymorphism found in, e.g. ML with a polymorphic typing rule
    for recursive defiitions. We show that semi-unification, the
    problem of solving inequalities over first-order terms,
    characterizes type checking in the Milner-Mycroft Calculus to
    polynomial time, even in the restricted case were nested
    definitions are disallowed. This permits us to extend some
    infeasibility results for related combinatorial problems to type
    inference and to correct several claims and statements in the
    literature. 

    We prove the existence of unique most general solutions of term
    inequalities, called most general semi-unifiers, and present an
    algorithm for computing them that terminates for all known inputs
    due to a novel ``extended occurs check''. We conjecture this
    algorithm to be uniformly terminating even though, at present,
    general semi-unification is not known to be decidable. We prove
    termination of our algorithm for a restricted case of
    semi-unification that is of independent interest.

    Finally, we offer an explanation for the apparent practicality of
    polymorphic type inference in the face of theoretical
    intractability results.",

    allowing machine support for the underlying semantic
    structures. MKM formats maintain strong invariants while trying to
    be foundationally unconstrained, which makes the induced design
    problem particularly challenging.

    In this situation, it is standard practice to define a minimal
    core language together with a scripting/macro facility for
    syntactic extensions that map into the core language. In practice,
    such extension facilities are either fully unconstrained (making
    invariants and machine support difficult) or limited to the object

    In this paper we develop a general methodology for extending MKM
    representation formats at the statement level. We show the utility
    (and indeed necessity) of statement-level extensions by
    redesigning the OMDoc format into a minimal, regular core language

    languages, via which systems can exchange mathematical
    knowledge. Major examples are the MathML-based markup languages
    and TPTP. However, these languages standardize only the syntax of
    the exchanged knowledge, which is insufficient when the involved
    logics are complex or numerous. Logical frameworks, on the other
    hand, allow representing the logics themselves (and are thus aware
    of the semantics), but they abstract from the concrete syntax.

    Maybe surprisingly, until recently, state-of-the-art logical
    frameworks were not quite able to adequately represent logics
    commonly used in formal systems. Using a recent extension of the
    logical framework LF, we show how to give concise formal
    definitions of the logics used in TPTP. We can also formally
    define translations and combinations between the various TPTP
    logics. This allows us to build sematics-aware tool support such
    as type-checking TPTP content.

    While our presentation focuses on the current TPTP logics, our
    approach can be easily extended to other logics and interchange
    languages. In particular, our logic representations can be used
    with both TPTP and MathML. Thus, a single definition of the

    formalism into account. Therefore, concrete management of change
    solutions are difficult to realize.

    The MMT language was designed as a generic declarative language
    that captures universal structural features while avoiding a
    commitment to a particular formalism. Therefore, it provides a
    promising framework for the systematic study of changes in

    code (an STM or state transition machine is a flow-chart-like
    program, low-level enough to be translated into efficient code on
    conventional computers). First, a compiler $\phi:LAMC\rightarrow
    STM$ from a lambda calculus dialect is defined. Any denotational
    defintion $\Delta$ of language $L$ defines a map
    $\over{\rightarrow}{\Delta}:L\rightarrow LAMC$, so 
    $\over{\rightarrow}{\Delta}\circ \phi$ compiles $L$ into STM
    code. Correctness follows from the correctness of $\phi$.

    The algebraic framework of Morris, ADJ, etc. is used. The set of
    STMs is given an algebraic structure so any
    $\over{\rightarrow}{\Delta} \circ \phi$ may be specified by giving
    a derived operator on STM for each syntax rule of $L$.

    This approach yields quite redundant object programs, so the paper
    ends by describing two flow analytic optimization methods. The
    first analyzes an already-produced STM to obtain information about
    its runtime behaviour which is used to optimize the STM. The
    second analyzer the generated compiling scheme to determine
    runtime properties of object programs in general which a compiler

    "Rust is a new systems programming language that promises to
    overcome the seemingly fundamental tradeoff between high-level

    formally proven, and there is good reason to question whether they
    actually hold. Specifically, Rust employs a string,
    ownership-based, type system, but then extends the expressive
    power of this core type system through libraries that internally
    use unsafe features. In this paper, we give the first formal (and
    machine-checked) safety proof for a language representing a
    realistic subset of Rust. Our proof is extensible in the sense
    that, for each new Rust library that uses unsafe features, we can
    say what verification condition it must satisfy in order for it to

    respect to these two criteria, while at the same time trying to
    remain consistent over the document and their own prior
    publications. In print media where notations are fixed at
    publication time, this is an over-constrained problem. In living

    preferences into account.

    We present a representational infrastructure for notations in

    the set of available notation definitions at arbitrary document
    levels, and they can guide the notation selection function via

  abstract =
    "Automated theorem provers are computer programs that check
    whether a logical conjecture follows from a set of logical
    statements. The conjecture and the statements are expressed in the
    language of some formal logic, such as first-order logic. Theorem
    provers for first-order logic have been used for automation in
    proof assistants, verification of programs, static analysis of
    networks, and other purposes. However, the efficient usage of
    these provers remains challenging. One of the challenges is the
    complexity of translating domain problems to first-order
    logic. Not only can such translation be cumbersome due to semantic
    differences between the domain and the logic, but it might
    inadvertently result in problems that provers cannot easily handle.

    The work presented in the thesis addresses this challenge by
    developing an extension of first-order logic named FOOL. FOOL
    contains syntactical features of programming languages and more
    expressive logics, is friendly for translation of problems from
    various domains, and can be efficiently suported by existing
    theorem provers. We describe the syntax and semantics of FOOL and
    present a simple translation from FOOL to plain first-order
    logic. We describe an efficient clausal normal form transformation
    algorithm for FOOL and based on it implement a support for FOOL in
    the Vampire theorem prover. We illustrate the efficient use of
    FOOL for program verification by describing a concise encoding of
    next state relations of imperative programs in FOOL. We show a
    usage of features of FOOL in problems of static analysis of
    networks. We demonstrate the efficiency of automated theorem
    proving in FOOL with an extensive set of experiments. In these
    experiments we compare the performance of Vampire on a large
    collection of problems from various sources translated to FOOL and
    ordinary first-order logic. Finally, we fix the syntax for FOOL in
    TPTP, the standard language of first-order theorem provers.",

    type system more powerful, but at the cost of increased

    of having no types at all. Typed formalisms have advantages too,
    stemming from the power of mechanical type checking. While types
    serve little purpose in hand proofs, they do help with mechanized

    "The polymorphic type discipline, as in the ML language, fits well
    within purely applicative languages, but does not extend naturally
    to the main feature of algorithmic languages: in-place update of
    data structures. Similar typing difficulties arise with other
    extensions of applicative languages: logical variables,
    communication channels, continuation handling. This work studies
    (in the setting of relational semantics) two new approaches to the
    polymorphic typing of these non-applicative features. The first
    one relies on a restriction of generalization over types (the
    notion of dangerous variables), and on a refined typing of
    functional values (closure typing). The resulting type system is
    compatible with the ML core language, and is the most expressive
    type systems for ML with imperative features so far. The second
    approach relies on switching to ``by-name'' sematics for the
    constructs of polymorphism, instead of the usual ``by-value''
    semanticcs. The resulting language differs from ML, but lends
    itself easily to polymorphic typing. Both approaches smoothly
    integrate non-applicative features and polymorphic typing.",

    "The motivation behind the work in very-high-level languages is to
    ease the programming task by providing the programmer with a
    language containing primitives or abstractions suitable to his
    problem area. The programmer is then able to spend his effort in
    the right place; he concentrates on solving his problem, and the
    resulting program will be more reliable as a result. Clearly, this
    is a worthwhile goal.

    Unfortunately, it is very difficult for a designer to select in
    advance all the abstractions which the users of his language might
    need. If a language is to be used at all, it is likely to be used
    to solve problems which its designer did not envision, and for
    which the abstractions embedded in the language are not sufficient.

    This paper presents an approach which allows the set of built-in
    abstractions to be augmented when the need for a new data
    abstraction is discovered. This approach to the handling of
    abstraction is an outgrowth of work on designing a language for
    structured programming. Relevant aspects of this language are
    described, and examples of the use and definitions of abstraction

    "This thesis presents and studies a unifying theory of dependent
    types ECC Extended Calculus of Constructions. ECC integrates
    Coquand-Huet's (impredicative) calculus of constructions and
    Martin-Lof's (predicative) type theory with universes, and turns
    out to be a strong and expressive calculus for formalization of
    mathematics, structured proof development and program specification.

    The meta theory of ECC is studied and we show that the calculus
    has good meta-theoretic properties. The main proof theoretic
    result is the {\sl strong normalization theorem} which makes
    explicit the predicativity of the predicative universes. The
    strong normalization result shows the proof theoretic consistency
    of the calculus; in particular, it implies the consistency of the
    embedded intuitionistic higher-order logic and the decidability of
    the theory. The meta-theoretic results establish the theoretical
    foundations both for pragmatic applications in theorem proving and
    program specification and for computer implementations of the
    theory. ECC has been implemente in the proof development system
    LEGO developed by Pollack.

    In ECC, dependent $\Sigma$ types are non-propositional types
    residing in the predicative universes and propositions are lifted
    as higher-level types as well. This solves the known difficulty
    that adding strong $\Sigma$ types to an impredicative system
    results in logical paradox and enables $\Sigma$ types to be used
    to express the intuitionistic notion of subsets. $\Sigma$ types
    together with type universes hence provide useful abstraction and
    module mechanisms for abstract description of mathematical
    theories and basic mechanisms for program specification and
    adequate formalization of abstract mathematics (e.g. abstract
    algebras and notions in category theory). A notion of (abstract)
    mathematical theory can be described and leads to a promising
    approach to {\sl abstract reasoning} and {\sl structured
    reasoning}. Program specifications can be expressed by $\Sigma$
    types, using propositions in the embedded logic to describe
    program properties (for example, by an equality reflection result,
    computational equality can be modeled by the propositional
    Leibniz's equality definable in the theory). These developments
    allow comprehensive structuring of formal or rigorous development
    of proofs and programs.

    Also discussed is how the calculus can be understood
    set-theoretically. We explain an $\omega-Set$ (realizability)
    model of the theory. In particular, propositions can be
    interpreted as partial equivalence relations and the predicative
    type universes as corresponding to large set universes.",

    limitation of expressive power because there are fewer operations

    and, as shown in this paper, plays a very useful role in making
    type theories more expressive for formal semantics. It not only
    gives a satisfactory solution to the basic problem of 'multiple
    categorisations' caused by interpreting common nouns as types, but
    provides a powerful formal framework to model interesting
    linguistic phenomena such as copredication, whose formal treatment
    has been found difficult in a Montagovian setting. In particular,
    we show how to formally introduce dot-types in a type theory with

  abstract =
    "One of the major challenges of building software systems is to
    ensure that the various components fit together in a well-defined
    manner. This problem is exacerbated by the recent advent of
    software components whose origin is unknown or inherently
    untrusted, such as mobile code or user extensions for operating
    system kernels or database servers. Such extensions are useful for
    implementing an efficient interaction model between a client and a
    server because several data exchanges between them can be saved at
    the cost of a single code exchange.

    In this dissertation, I propose to tackle such system integrity
    and security problems with techniques from mathematical logic and
    programming language semantics. I propose a framework, called 
    {\sl proof-carrying code}, in which the extension provider sends
    along with the extension code a representation of a formal proof
    that the code meets certain safety and correctness
    requirements. Then, the code receiver can ensure the safety of
    executing the extension by validating the attached proof. The
    major advantages of proof-carrying code are that it requires a
    simple trusted infrastructure and that it does not impose run-time
    penalties for the purpose of ensuring safety.

    In addition to the concept of proof-carrying code, this
    dissertation contributes the idea of certifying compilation. A 
    {\sl certifying compiler} emits, in addition to optimized target
    code, function specifications and loop invariants that enable a
    theorem-proving agent to prove non-trivial properties of the
    target code, such as type safety. Such a certifying compiler,
    along with a proof-generating theorem prover, is not only a
    convenient producer of proof-carrying code but also a powerful
    software-engineering tool. The certifier also acts as an effective
    referee for the correctness of each compilation, thus simplifying
    considerably compiler testing and maintenance.

    A complete system for proof-carrying code must also contain a 
    {\sl proof-generating theorem prover} for the purpose of producing
    the attached proofs of safety. This dissertation shows how
    standard decision procedures can be adapted so that they can
    produce detailed proofs of the proved predicates and also how
    these proofs can be encoded compactly and checked
    efficiently. Just like for the certifying compiler, a
    proof-generating theorem prover has significant software
    engineering advantages over a traditional prover. In this case, a
    simple proof checker can ensure the soundness of each successful
    proving task and indirectly assist in testing and maintenance of
    the theorem prover.",

    paper describes the results of an investigation into this question,
    determining how much specifications generalized from program runs
    must be changed in order to be verified by a static checker.
    Surprisingly, small test suites captured nearly all program behavior
    required by a specific type of static checking; the static checker
    guaranteed that the implementations satisfy the generated specifications
  , and ensured the absence of runtime exceptions. Measured
    against this verification task, the generated specifications scored
    over 90 percent on precision, a measure of soundness, and on recall, a
    measure of completeness.
    
    This is a positive result for testing, because it suggests that 
    dynamic analyses can capture all semantic information of interest for
    certain applications. The experimental results demonstrate that a
    specific technique, dynamic invariant detection, is effective at
    generating consistent, sufficient specifications for use by a static

    "Library authors often are faced with a design chice: should a
    function with preconditions be implemented as a partial function,
    or by returning a failure condition on incorrect use? Neither

    errors. Failure conditions must be checked at the use-site,
    placing an unfair tax on the users who have ensured that the
    function's preconditions were correctly met.

    In this paper, we introduce an API design concept called `ghosts
    of departed proofs' based on the following observation:
    sophisticated preconditions can be encoded in Haskell's type
    system with no run-time overhead, by using proofs that inhabit
    phantom type parameters attached to new type wrappers. The user
    expresses correctness arguments by constructing proofs to inhabit
    these phantom types. Critically, this technique allows the library 
    {\sl user} to decide when and how to validate that the API's
    preconditions are met.

    The 'ghost of departed proofs' approach to API design can achieve
    many of the benefits of dependent types and refinement types, yet
    only requires some minor and well-understood extensions to Haskell
    2010. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a series
    of case studies, showing how to enforce novel invariants for

  abstract =
    "Dependent type theories have a long history of being used for
    theorem proving. One aspect of type theory which makes it very
    powerful as a proof language is that it mixes deduction with
    computation. This also makes type theory a good candidate for
    programming -- the strength of the type system allows properties
    of programs to be stated and established, and the computational
    properties provide semantics for the programs.

    This thesis is concerned with bridging the gap between the
    theoretical presentations of type theory and the requirements of
    practical programming languages. Although there are many
    challenging research problems left to solve before we have an
    industrial scale programming language based on type theory, this
    thesis takes us a good step along the way.

    In functional programming languages pattern matching provides a
    concise notation for defining functions. In dependent type theory,
    pattern matching becomes even more powerful, in that inspecting
    the value of a particular term can reveal information about the
    types and values of other terms. In this thesis we give a type
    checking algorithm for definitions by pattern matching in type
    theory, supporting overlapping patterns, and pattern matching on
    intermediate results using the {\sl with} rule.

    Traditional presentations of type theory suffer from rather
    verbose notation, cluttering programs and proofs with, for
    instance, explicit type information. One solution to this problem
    is to allow terms that can be inferred automatically to be
    omitted. This is usually implemented by inserting metavariables in
    place of the omitted terms and using unification to solve these
    metavariables during type checking. We present a type checking
    algorithm for a theory with metavariables and prove its soundness
    independent of whether the metavariables are solved or not.

    In any programming language it is important to be able to
    structure large programs into separate units or modules and limit
    the interaction between these modules. In this thesis we present a
    simple, but powerful module system for a dependently typed
    language. The main focus of the module system is to manage the
    name space of a program, and an important characteristic is a
    clear separation between the module system and the type checker,
    making it largely independent of the underlying language.

    As a side track, not directly related to the use of type theory
    for programming, we present a connnection between type theory and
    a first-order logic theorem prover. This connection saves the user
    the burden of proving simple, but tedious first-order theorems by
    leaving them for the prover. We use a transparent translation to
    first-order logic which makes the proofs constructed by the
    theorem prover human readable. The soundness of the connection is
    established by a general metatheorem.

    Finally we put our work into practice in the implementation of a
    programming language, Agda, based on type theory. As an
    illustrating example, we show how to program a simple certified
    prover for equations in a commutative monoid, which can be used
    internally in Agda. Much more impressive examples have been done
    by others, showing that the ideas developed in this thesis are
    viable in practice.",

    We give a cost model to pre- and post-closure-conversion code by
    formalizing profiling semantics that keep track of the time and
    space resources needed for the execution of a program, taking
    garbage collection into account. To show preservation of time and

    correctness. Using this framework, we show semantics preservation

    divergence preservation and space safety for diverging source

    This is the first formal proof of space-safety of a

    "Compiler correctness is an old problem, with results stretching

    truly impressive verification efforts, the theorems being proved
    were only about the compilation of whole programs, a theoretically
    quite appealing but practically unrealistic simplification. For a
    compiler correctness theorem to assure complete trust, the theorem
    must reflect the reality of how the compiler will be used.

    There has been much recent work on more realistic 'compositional'
    compiler correctness aimed at proving correct compilation of
    components while supporting linking with components compiled from
    different languages using different compilers. However, the
    variety of theorems, stated in remarkably different ways, raises
    questions about what researchers even mean by a 'compiler is
    correct'. In this pearl, we develop a new framework with which to
    understand compiler correctness theorems in the presence of
    linking, and apply it to understanding and comparing this
    diversity of results. In doing so, not only are we better able to

    procedures. Here completeness means that the procedure is

    illustrate the process of turning a decision procedure into a
    synthesis procedure using linear integer arithmetic as an example.

    However, writing a complete specification can be a tedious task,
    sometimes even harder than writing the code itself. To overcome
    this problem, ideally the user could provide a few input-output
    examples, and then the code should be automatically derived. We

    rich specification, the synthesizer needs an advanced program
    verification mechanism that is sufficiently expressive and fully
    automatic. In this talk, I will present a program synthesis technique
    based on refinement type checking: a verification mechanism that
    supports automatic reasoning about expressive properties through a
    combination of types and SMT solving.
    
    The talk will present two applications of type-driven synthesis. The
    first one is a tool called Synquid, which creates recursive functional
    programs from scratch given a refinement type as input. Synquid is the
    first synthesizer powerful enough to automatically discover programs
    that manipulate complex data structures, such as balanced trees and
    propositional formulas. The second application is a language called
    Lifty, which uses type-driven synthesis to repair information flow
    leaks. In Lifty, the programmer specifies expressive information flow
    policies by annotating the sources of sensitive data with refinement
    types, and the compiler automatically inserts access checks necessary
    to enforce these policies across the code."

    manipulate data-structures against complex specifications --
    specifications that describe the structure of the heap, the data
    stored within it, and separation and framing of
    sub-structures. Natural proofs are a subclass of proofs that are
    amenable to completely automated reasoning, that provide sound but
    incomplete procedures, and that capture common reasoning tactics
    in program verification. We develop a dialect of separation logic
    over heaps, called DRYAD, with recursive definitions that avoids
    explicit quantification. We develop ways to reason with heaplets
    using classical logic over the theory of sets, and develop natural
    proofs for reasoning using proof tactics involving disciplined
    unfoldings and formula abstractions. Natural proofs are encoded
    into decidable theories of first-order logic so as to be
    discharged using SMT solvers.

    We also implement the technique and show that a large class of
    more than 100 correct programs that manipulate data-structures are
    amenable to full functional correctness using the proposed natural
    proof method. These programs are drawn from a variety of sources
    including standard data-structures, the Schorr-Waite algorithm for
    garbage collection, a large number of low-level C routines from
    the Glib library, the OpenBSD library and the Linux kernel, and
    routines from a secure verified OS-browser project. Our work is
    the first that we know of that can handle such a wide range of
    full functional verification properties of heaps automatically,
    given pre/post and loop invariant annotations. we believe that
    this work paves the way for the deductive verification technology
    to be used by programmers who do not (and need not) understand the
    internals of the underlying logic solvers, significantly

    "One of the most promising applications of mathematical knowledge
    management is search: Even if we restrict attention to the tiny
    fragment of mathematics that has been formalized, the amount
    exceeds the comprehension of an individual human.

    Based on the generic representation language MMT, we introduce the
    mathematical query langauge QMT: It combines simplicity,
    expressivity, and scalability while avoiding a commitment to a
    particular logical formalism. QMT can integrate various search
    paradigms such as unification, semantic web, or XQuery style
    queries, and QMT queries can span different mathematical
    libraries.

    We have implemented QMT as a part of the MMT API. This combination
    provides a scalable indexing and query engine that can be readily
    applied to any library of mathematical knowledge. While our focus
    here is on libraries that are available in a content markup
    language, QMT naturally extends to presentation and narration
    markup languages.",

    In this work, we allow MMT theories to declare user-devined
    literals, which makes literals as user-extensible as operators,
    axioms, and notations. This is particularly important for
    framework languages, which must be able to represent any choice of
    literals. Theoretically, our literals are introduced by importing
    a model that defines the denotations of some types and function
    symbols. Practically, MMT is coupled with a programming language,
    in which these models are defined.

    Our results are implemented in the MMT system. In particular,
    literals and computation on them are integrated with the parser
    and type checker.",

    "Let $F(x,u_1,\ldots,u_i)$ be a squarefree multivariate polynomial
    in main variable $x$ and sub-variables $u_1\ldots u_i$. We say
    that the leading coefficient (LC) of $F$ is singular if it
    vanishes at the origin of the sub-variables. A representative
    algorithm for non-sparse multivariate polynomial GCD is the EZ-GCD
    algorithm, which is based on the generalized Hensel construction
    (GHC). In order to apply the GHC easily, we requires 1) the LC of
    $F$ is non-singular, 2) $F(x,0,\ldots,0)$ is squarefree, and 3)
    the initial Hensel factor of GCD is ``lucky''. These requirements
    are usually satisfied by the ``nonzero substitution'', i.e. to
    shift the origin of sub-variables. However, the nonzero
    substitution may cause a drastic increase of the number of terms
    of $F$ if $F$ is sparse. In 1993, Sasaki and Kako proposed the
    extended Hensel construction (EHC) which does not perform the
    nonzero substitution even if the LC is singular. Using the EHC,
    Inaba implemented an algorithm of multivariate polynomial
    factorization and verified that it is very useful for sparse
    polynomials. In this paper, we apply the EHC for the computation
    of GCD of sparse multivariate polynomials. In order to find a
    lucky initial factor, we utilize the weighting of sub-variables,
    etc. Our naive implementation in Maple shows that our algorithm is
    comparable in performance to Maple's GCD routine base on the

    "META II is a compiler writing language which consists of syntax
    equations resembling Backus normal form and into which
    instructions to output assembly language commands are
    inserted. Compilers have been written in this language for VALGOL
    I and VALGOL II. The former is a simple algebraic language
    designed for the purpose of illustrating META II The latter
    contains a fairly arge subset of ALGOL 60.

    The method of writing compilers which is given in detail in the
    paper may be explained briefly as follows. Each synta equation is
    translated into a recursive subroutine which tests the input
    string for a particular phrase structure, and deletes it if
    found. Backup is avoided by the extensive use of factoring in the
    syntax equations. For each source language, an interpreter is
    written and programs are compiled into that interpretive language.

    META II is not intended as a standard language which everyone will
    use to write compilers. Rather, it is an example of a simple
    working language which can give one a good start in designing a
    compiler-writing compiler suited to his own needs. Indeed, the
    META II compiler is written in its own language, thus lending
    itself to modification.",

  abstract =
    "This dissertation is concerned with interactive proof
    construction and automated proof search in type theories, in
    particular the Calculus of Constructions and its subsystems.
 
    Type theories can be conceived as expressive logics which combine
    a functiona programming language, strong typing and a higher-order
    logic. They are therefore a suitable formalism for specification
    and verification systems. However, due to their expressiveness, it
    is difficult to provide appropriate deductive support for type
    theories. This dissertation first examines general methods for
    proof construction in type theories and then explores how these
    methods can be refined to yield proof search procedures for
    specialized fragments of the language.

    Proof development in type theories usually requires the
    construction of a term having a given type in a given context. For
    the term to be constructed, a {\sl metavariable} is introduced
    which is successively instantiated in the course of the proof. A
    naive use of metavariables leads to problems, such as
    non-commutativity of reduction and instantiation and the
    generation of ill-typed terms during reduction. For solving these
    problems, a calculus with {\sl explicit substitutions} is
    introduced, and it is shown that this calculus preserves
    properties such as strong normalisation and decidability of typing.

    In order to obtain a calculus appropriate for proof search, the
    usual natural deduction presentation of type theories is replaced
    by a {\sl sequent style presentation}. It is shown that the
    calculus thus obtained is correct with respect to the original
    calculus. Completeness (proved with a cut-elimination argument) is
    shown for all predicative fragments of the lambda cube.

    This dissertation concludes with a discussion of some techniques
    that make proof search practically applicable, such as unification
    and pruning of the proof search space by exploiting
    impermutabilities of the sequent calculus.",

    "We present a method for providing semantic interpretations for
    languages with a type system featuring inheritance polymorphism. Our
    approach is illustrated on an extension of the language Fun of
    Cardelli and Wegner, which we interpret via a translation into an
    extended polymorphic lambda calculus. Our goal is to interpret
    inheritances in Fun via coercion functions which are definable in the
    target of the translation. Existing techniques in the theory of
    semantic domains can be then used to interpret the extended
    polymorphic lambda calculus, thus providing many models for the
    original language. This technique makes it possible to model a rich
    type discipline which includes parametric polymorphism and recursive
    types as well as inheritance. A central difficulty in providing
    interpretations for explit type disciplines featuring inheritance in
    the sense discussed in this paper arises from the fact that programs
    can type-check in more than one way. Since interpretations follow the
    type-checking derivations, coherence theorems are required: that is,
    one must prove that the meaning of a program does not depend on the
    way it was type-checked. Proofs of such theorems for our proposed
    interpretation are the basic technical results of this paper. 
    Interestingly, proving coherence in the presence of recursive
    types, variants, and abstract types forced us to reexamine fundamental
    equational properties that arise in proof theory (in the form of
    commutative reductions) and domain theory (in the form of strict vs
    non-strict functions).",

    \item no dedicated code area is used as the code is placed

    structures on the heap
    \item variables in function and predicate symbol positions are

    \item a simple English-like syntax is used as an intermediate

    "One of the striking characteristics of mathematical reasoning is
    the contrast between the formal aspects of mathematical truth and
    the informal character of the ways to that truth. Among the many
    important and usually informal mathematical activities we are
    interested by proof analogy (i.e. common pattern between proofs of
    different theorems) in the context of interactive theorem
    proving. In some sense we propose a partial contribution of one of
    the Polya's wishes [Polya 73]:
    \begin{quote}
    Analogy pervades all our thinking, our everyday speech and our
    trivial conclusions as well as artistic way of expression and the
    highest scientific achievements... but analogy may reach the level
    of mathematical precision...
    \end{quote}
    
    It is a work in philosophy of mathematics [Resnik 75], in which
    mathematics is viewed as studying {\sl patterns} or 
    {\sl structures}, which encouraged us to pursue our aim of
    partially formalizing {\sl analogy}. We naturally arrived at the
    need of considering other activities strongly tied to the notion
    of analogy and very well known of the working mathematician:
    {\sl generalization}, {\sl abstraction} and {\sl analysis of
    proofs}.

    Let us assume that the user has to prove a conjecture C. Given a
    proof P for a known theorem T, he describes in the langauge L a
    scheme of P. Then he expresses the syntactic analogy he views as
    relevant between the scheme of P and what ``should be'' a proof
    scheme for C, as a {\sl transformation rule}. This process needs
    analysis of proofs, generalization and abstraction.

    A second order pattern matching algorithm constructs matchers of P
    and its scheme, and applies them to the intended proof scheme of
    the conjecture C. In the best case one obtains a potential proof
    of C, but in general one obtains a more instantiated proof-scheme
    with some ``holes'' to be filled by a theorem prover. In both
    cases a proof-checking process is necessary (analogy is in general
    a heuristic way of thinking).

    A question arises naturally: ``What to do when the assumed analogy
    fails?''. We study in this paper one of the possible answers:
    ``Inforamation may be extracted from the failure in order to 
    {\sl suggest lemmas} that try to {\sl semantically} restore
    analogy''. Of coure these lemmas an also serve for detecting wrong
    analogies (for example, if required lemmas clearly cannot be
    theorems.). Two kinds of failure are possible:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The given proof P and its proposed scheme are not matchable
    \item A type error is detected in the instantiated proof scheme
    for C.
    \end{enumerate}

    We give in the following a method to suggest lemmas in the first
    case, and sketch some ideas of how to use such a possibility in
    the second case.",

    functions required considerably more complex machinery than his
    earlier ones for purely transcendental functions. Moses'

  abstract = 
    "This thesis is aimed at simplifying the user-interaction in
    semi-interactive theorem proving for imperative programs.  More
    specically , we describe the creation of customised induction rules
    that are tailor-made for the specific program to verify and thus make
    the resulting proof simpler.  The concern is in user interaction,
    rather than in proof strength.  To achiev e this, two different
    verication techniques are used.
    
    In the first approach, we develop an idea where a software testing
    technique, partition analysis, is used to compute a partition of the
    domain of the induction variable, based on the branch predicates in
    the program we wish to prove correct.  Based on this partition we
    derive mechanically a partitioned induction rule, which then inherits
    the divide-and-conquer style of partition analysis, and (hopefully) is
    easier to use than the standard (Peano) induction rule.
    
    The second part of the thesis continues with a more thorough
    development of the method.  Here the connection to software testing is
    completely removed and the focus is on inductive theorem proving only.
    This time, we make use of failed proof attempts in a theorem prover
    to gain information about the problem structure and create the
    partition.  Then, based on the partition we create an induction rule,
    in destructor style, that is customised to make the proving of the
    loop simpler.
    
    With the customised induction rules, in comparison to standard (Peano)
    induction or Noetherian induction, the required user interaction is
    moved to an earlier point in the proof which also becomes more
    modularised.  Moreover, by using destructor style induction we
    circumvent the problem of creating inverses of functions.  The
    soundness of the customised induction rules created by the method is
    shown. Furthermore, the machinery of the theorem prover (KeY) is used
    to make the method automatic.  The induction rules are developed to
    prove the total correctness of loops in an object-oriented language
    and we concentrate on integers.",

    "Neural program embedding has shown potential in aiding the
    analysis of large-scale, complicated software. Newly proposed deep
    neural architectures pride themselves on learning program
    semantics rather than superficial syntactic features. However, by
    considering the source code only, the vast majority of neural
    networks do not capture a deep, precise representation of program
    semantics. In this paper, we present DYPRO, a novel deep neural
    network that learns from program execution traces. Compared to the
    prior dynamic models, not only is DYPRO capable of generalizing
    across multiple executions for learning a program's dynamic
    semantics in its entirety, but DYPRO is also more efficient when
    dealing with programs yielding long execution traces. For
    evaluation, we task DYPRO with semantic classification
    (i.e. categorizing programs based on their semantics) and compared
    it against two prominent static models: Gated Graph Neural Network
    and TreeLSTM. We find that DYPRO achieves the highest prediction
    accuracy among all models. To further reeal the capacity of all
    aforementioned deep neural architectures, we examine if the models
    can learn to detect deeper semantic properties of a program. In

    DYPRO beats all static models by a wide margin.",

    "Modern functional programming languages, such as Haskell or

    important topic in the Programming Languages research, there is
    little work on the mechanization of the metatheory of type
    inference in theorem provers. In particular we are unaware of any
    complete formalization of the type inference algorithms that are
    the backbone of modern functional languages.

    This paper presents the first full mechanical formalization of the
    metatheory for higher-ranked polymorphic type inference. The
    system that we formalize is the bidirectional type system by
    Dunfield and Krishnaswami (DK). The DK type system has two
    variants (a declarative and an algorithmic one) that have been
    manually proven sound, complete and decidable. We present a
    mechanical formalization in the Abella theorem provers of DK's
    declarative type system with a novel algorithmic system. We have a
    few reasons to use a new algorithm. Firstly, our new algorithm
    employs worklist judgments, which precisely capture the scope of
    variables and simplify the formalization of scoping in a theorem
    prover. Secondly, while DKs original formalizations comes with
    very well-written manual proofs, there are several details missing
    and some incorrect proofs, which complicate the task of writing a
    mechanized proof. Despite the use of a different algorithm we
    prove the same results as DK, although with significantly
    different proofs and proof techniques. Since such type inference
    algorithms are quite subtle and have a complex metatheory,
    mechanical formalizations are an important advance in type

    object.  The combinatory object representing a program is specified,
    in general, by means of a system of reduction relations among the
    representations of the program constituents.  This object denotes, in
    terms of the combinatory logic, the function that the program is
    intended to compute.

    The model has been derived by using intuitive, functional

    "Standard ML is a major revision of earlier dialects of the functional
    language ML. We describe the first compiler written for Standard ML in
    Standard ML.  The compiler incorporates a number of novel features and
    techniques, and is probably the largest system written to date in
    Standard ML.
    
    Great attention was paid to modularity in the construction of the
    compiler, leading to a successful large-scale test of the modular
    capabilities of Standard ML.  The front end is useful for purposes
    other than compilation, and the back end is easily retargetable (we
    have code generators for the VAX and MC68020). The module facilities
    of Standard ML were taken into account early in the design of the
    compiler, and they particularly influenced the environment management
    component of the front end. For example, the symbol table structure is
    designed for fast access to opened structures.
    
    The front end of the compiler is a single phase that integrates
    parsing, environment management, and type checking. The middle end
    uses a sophisticated decision tree scheme to produce efficient
    pattern matching code for functions and case expressions. The abstract
    syntax produced by the front end is translated into a simple
    lambda-calculus-based intermediate representation that lends itself to
    easy case analysis and optimization in the code generator. Special
    care was taken in designing the mntime data structures for fast
    allocation and garbage collection.
    
    We describe the overall organization of the compiler and present some
    of the data representations and algorithms used in its various
    phases. We conclude with some lessons learned about the ML language
    itself and about compilers for modem functional languages.",

    "Many modern programming environments use tag bits at runtime to

    common in systems with garbage collection, since the garbage
    collector must be able to distinguish pointers from non-pointers,
    and to learn the length of records pointed to.

    The use of tag bits leads to inefficiency. In addition to the
    obvious space overhead (tag bits and record descriptors occupy
    memory space), there is a time overhead: tag bits must be stripped
    off of data before arithmetic operations are performed, and
    re-attached to the data when it is stored into memory. This takes
    either extra instructions at runtime, or special tag-handling
    hardware, or both.

    This paper shows how the use of tag bits, record descriptor words,
    explicit type parameters, and the like can be avoided in languages
    (like ML) with static polymorphic typechecking. Through a form of
    tag will still be required for user-defined variant records, all
    other type information can be encoded once -- in the program --
    rather than replicated many times in the data. This can lead to
    savings in both space and time.",

    results can be used in formal proofs is not immediate. In this paper
    we show how to obtain formal proofs of statements such as Prime(61) in
    the context of Peano arithmetic or $(x + 1)(x + 1) = x 2 + 2x + 1$ in
    the context of rings. We hope that the method will help bridge the gap

    statements are about mathematical objects and algorithms, proofs show
    the correctness of statements and computations, and computations are
    dealing with objects and proofs. Interactive computer systems for a
    full integration of defining, computing and proving are based on
    this. The human defines concepts, constructs algorithms and provides
    proofs, while the machine checks that the definitions are well formed
    and the proofs and computations are correct. Results formalized so far
    demonstrate the feasibility of this ‘computer mathematics’. Also there
    are very good applications. The challenge is to make the systems more

    "Despite the reputed limitations of first order logic, it is easy to
    state and prove almost all interesting properties of recursive
    programs within a simple first order theory, by using an approach we
    call 'first order programming logic'. Unlike higher order logics based
    on fixed-point induction, first order programming logic is founded on
    deductive principles that are familiar to most programmers. Informal
    structural induction arguments (such as termination proofs for LISP
    append, McCarthy’s 91-function, and Ackermann’s function) have direct
    formalizations within the system.

    The essential elements of first order programming logic are:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The data domain $D$ must be a finitely generated set that 
    explicitly includes the 'undefined' object $\bot$
    (representing nontermination) as well as ordinary data objects.
    \item Recursive programs over $D$ are treated as logical definitions
    augmenting a first order theory of the data domain.
    \item The interpretation of a recursive program is the least 
    fixed-point of the functional corresponding to the program.
    \end{enumerate}

    Since the data domain $D$ is a finitely generated set, the first order
    axiomatization of $D$ includes a structural induction axiom scheme. This
    axiom scheme serves as the fundamental 'proof rule' of first order
    programming logic.

    The major limitation of first order programming logic is that every
    fixed-point of the functional corresponding to a recursive program is
    an acceptable interpretation for the program. The logic fails to
    capture the notion of least fixed-point. To overcome this limitation,
    we present a simple, effective procedure for transforming an arbitrary
    recursive program into an equivalent recursive program that has a
    unique fixed-point, yet retains the logical structure of the
    original. Given this transformation technique, it is our experience
    that first order programming logic is sufficiently powerful to prove
    almost any property of practical interest about the functions computed
    by recursive programs.",

    "Three studies in the machine assisted proof of recursion
    implementation are described. The verification system used is
    Edinburgh LCF (Logic for Computable Functions). Proofs are generated,
    in LCF, in a goal-oriented fashion by the application of strategies
    reflecting informal proof plans. LCF is introduced in Chapter 1. We
    present three case studies in which proof strategies are developed and
    (except in the third) tested in LCF. Chapter 2 contains an account of
    the machine generated proofs of three program transformations (from
    recursive to iterative function schemata). Two of the examples are
    taken from Manna and Waldinger. In each case, the recursion is
    implemented by the introduction of a new data type, e.g., a stack or
    counter. Some progress is made towards the development of a general
    strategy for producing the equivalence proofs of recursive and
    iterative function schemata by machine. Chapter 3 is concerned with
    the machine generated proof of the correctness of a compiling
    algorithm. The formulation, borrowed from Russell, includes a simple
    imperative language with a while and conditional construct, and a low
    level language of labelled statements, including jumps. We have, in
    LCF, formalised his denotational descriptions of the two languages and
    performed a proof of the preservation of the semantics under
    compilation. In Chapter 4, we express and informally prove the
    correctness of a compiling algorithm for a language containing
    declarations and calls of recursive procedures. We present a low level
    language whose semantics model a standard activation stack
    implementation. Certain theoretical difficulties (connected with
    recursively defined relations) are discussed, and a proposed proof in
    LCF is outlined. The emphasis in this work is less on proving original
    theorems, or even automatically finding proofs of known theorems, than
    on (i) exhibiting and analysing the underlying structure of proofs,
    and of machine proof attempts, and (ii) investigating the nature of
    the interaction (between a user and a computer system) required to
    generate proofs mechanically; that is, the transition from informal
    proof plans to behaviours which cause formal proofs to be performed.",

  abstract =
    "Programs have precise semantics, so we can use mathematical proof to
    establish their properties. These proofs are often too large to
    validate with the usual “social process” of mathematics, so instead we
    create and check them with theorem-proving software. This software
    must be advanced enough to make the proof process tractable, but this
    very sophistication casts doubt upon the whole enterprise: who
    verifies the verifier?
    
    We begin with a simple proof checker, Level 1, that only accepts
    proofs composed of the most primitive steps, like Instantiation and
    Cut. This program is so straightforward the ordinary, social process
    can establish its soundness and the consistency of the logical
    theory it implements (so we know theorems are “always true”).
    
    Next, we develop a series of increasingly capable proof checkers,
    Level 2, Level 3, etc.  Each new proof checker accepts new kinds of
    proof steps which were not accepted in the previous levels. By taking
    advantage of these new proof steps, higher-level proofs can be
    written more concisely than lower-level proofs, and can take less time
    to construct and check. Our highest-level proof checker, Level 11, can
    be thought of as a simplified version of the ACL2 or NQTHM theorem
    provers. One contribution of this work is to show how such systems can
    be verified.
    
    To establish that the Level 11 proof checker can be trusted, we first
    use it, without trusting it, to prove the fidelity of every Level n to
    Level 1: whenever Level n accepts a proof of some $\phi$, there exists a
    Level 1 proof of $\phi$. We then mechanically translate the Level 11 proof
    for each Level n into a Level n − 1 proof—that is, we create a Level 1
    proof of Level 2’s fidelity, a Level 2 proof of Level 3’s fidelity,
    and so on. This layering shows that each level can be trusted, and
    allows us to manage the sizes of these proofs.
    
    In this way, our system proves its own fidelity, and trusting Level 11
    only requires us to trust Level 1.",

    based on an idealised version of ACL2’s computational logic and
    provides the user with high-level tactics similar to ACL2’s. In
    contrast to NQTHM and ACL2, Milawa has a small kernel that is somewhat
    like an LCF-style system. We explain how the Milawa theorem prover is
    constructed as a sequence of reflective extensions from its
    kernel. The kernel establishes the soundness of these extensions
    during Milawa’s boot-strapping process. Going deeper, we explain how
    we have shown that the Milawa kernel is sound using the HOL4 theorem
    prover. In HOL4, we have formalized its logic, proved the logic sound,
    and proved that the source code for the Milawa kernel (1,700 lines of
    Lisp) faithfully implements this logic. Going even further, we have
    combined these results with the x86 machine-code level verification of
    the Lisp runtime Jitawa. Our top-level theorem states that Milawa can
    never claim to prove anything that is false when it is run on this

    "Type inference gives programmers the benefit of static,
    compile-time type checking without the cost of manually specifying
    types, and has long been a standard feature of functional programming
    languages. However, it has proven difficult to integrate type
    inference with subtyping, since the unification engine at the core of
    classical type inference accepts only equations, not subtyping
    constraints.
    
    This thesis presents a type system combining ML-style parametric
    polymorphism and subtyping, with type inference, principal types,
    and decidable type subsumption. Type inference is based on {\sl
    biunification} , an analogue of unification that works with
    subtyping constraints.
    
    Making this possible are several contributions, beginning with the
    notion of an 'extensible' type system, in which an open world of
    types is assumed, so that no typeable program becomes untypeable
    by the addition of new types to the language. While previous
    formulations of subtyping fail to be extensible, this thesis
    shows that adopting a more algebraic approach can remedy this.
    Using such an approach, this thesis develops the theory of
    biunification, shows how it is used to infer types, and shows how
    it can be efficiently implemented, exploiting deep connections
    between the algebra of regular languages and polymorphic subtyping.",

    programs.
    
    This is made possible by keeping a strict separation between the types
    used to describe inputs and those used to describe outputs, and
    extending the classical unification algorithm to handle subtyping

  abstract = 
    "Despite its mathematical origins, progress in computer assisted
    reasoning has mostly been driven by applications in computer science,
    like hardware or protocol security verification. Paradoxically, it has
    yet to gain widespread acceptance in its original domain of
    application, mathematics; this is commonly attributed to a 'lack of
    libraries': attempts to formalize advanced mathematics get bogged down
    into the formalization of an unwieldly large set of basic resuts.

    This problem is actually a symptom of a deeper issue: the main
    function of computer proof systems, checking proofs down to their
    finest details, is at odds with mathematical practice, which ignores
    or defers details in order to apply and combine abstractions in
    creative and elegant ways. Mathematical texts commonly leave logically
    important parts of proofs as 'exercises to the reader', and are rife
    with 'abuses of notation that make mathematics tractable' (according
    to Bourbaki). This (essential) flexibility cannot be readily
    accomodated by the narrow concept of 'proof library' used by most
    proof assistants and based on 19th century first-order logic: a
    collection of constants, definitions, and lemmas.  

    This mismatch is familiar to software engineers, who have been
    struggling for the past 50 years to reconcile the flexibility needed
    to produce sensible user requirements with the precision needed to
    implement them correctly with computer code. Over the last 20 years
    object and components have replaced traditional data and procedure
    libraries, partly bridging this gap and making it possible to build
    significantly larger computer systems.  

    These techniques can be implemented in compuer proof systems by
    exploiting advances in mathematical logic. Higher-order logics allow
    the direct manipulation of functions; this can be used to assign
    behaviour, such as simplification rules, to symbols, similarly to
    objects. Advanced type systems can assign a secondary, contextual
    meaning to expressions, using mechanisms such as type classes, 
    similarly to the metadata in software components. The two can be combined
    to perform reflection, where an entire statement gets quoted as
    metadata and then proved algorithmically by some decision procedure.

    We propose to use a more modest, small-scale form of reflection, to
    implement mathematical components. We use the type-derived metadata to
    indicate how symbols, definitions and lemmas should be used in other
    theories, and functions to implement this usage — roughly, formalizing
    some of the exercize section of a textbook. We have applied
    successfully this more engineered approch to computer proofs in our
    past work on the Four Color Theorem, the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem, and
    our ongoing long-term effort on the Odd Order Theorem, which is the
    starting point of the proof of the Classification of Finite Simple
    Groups (the famous 'monster theorem' whose proof spans 10,000 pages in
    400 articles).",

    "Formal reasoning about computer programs can be based directly on the
    seman tics of the programming language, or done in a special purpose
    logic like Hoare logic.  The advantage of the first approach is that
    it guarantees that the formal reasoning applies to the language being
    used (it is well known, for example, that Hoare's assignment axiom
    fails to hold for most programming languages).  The advantage of the
    second approach is that the proofs can be more direct and natural.
    
    In this paper, an attempt to get the advantages of both approaches
    is described.  The rules of Hoare logic are mechanically derived
    from the semantics of a simple imperative programming language
    (using the HOL system).  These rules form the basis for a simple
    program verifier in which verification conditions are generated by LCF
    -style tactics whose validations use the derived Hoare rules.
    Because Hoare logic is derived, rather than postulated, it is straight
    tforw ard to mix seman tic and axiomatic rea- soning.  It is also
    forward to combine the constructs of Hoare logic with other
    application-specific notations.  This is briefly illustrated for
    various logical constructs, including termination statements, VDM-style
    `relational' correctness specifications, weakest precondition
    statements and dynamic logic formulae.
    
    The theory underlying the work presented here is well known. Our
    contribution is to propose a way of mechanizing this theory in a
    way that makes certain practical details work out smoothly .",

    unifying theme to the proposed logical extensions, and that is the
    scoped introduction of extensions to a programming context. More
    specifically, these extensions are the ability to introduce variables
    whose scope is limited to the term in which they occur (i.e. A-bound
    variables within A-terms), the ability to intro~iuce into a goal a
    fresh constant whose scope is limited to the derivation of that goal,
    and the ability to introduce into a goal a program clause whose scope
    is limited to the derivation of that goal. The purpose of the
    additions for increased control is to facilitate the raising and
    handling of failures.
    
    To motivate these various extensions, we have repeatedly appealed to
    examples related to the construction of a generic theorem prover. It

    "Horn clause logic with equality is an amalgamation of functional and
    logic programming languages. A sound and complete operational
    semantics for logic programs with equality is based on resolution to

    expressions. This paper proposes a technique for compiling programs
    with these inference rules into programs of a low-level abstract
    machine which can be efficiently executed on conventional
    architectures. The presented approach is based on an extension of the
    Warren abstract machine (WAM). In our approach pure logic programs
    without function definitions are compiled in the same way as in the
    WAM-approach, and for logic programs with function definitions
    particular instructions are generated for occurrences of functions
    inside clause bodies. In order to obtain an efficient implementation
    of functional computations, a stack of occurrences of function symbols
    in goals is managed by the abstract machine. The compiler generates
    the necessary instructions for the efficient manipulation of the
    occurrence stack from the given equational logic programs.",

    because abstract mathematical requirements cannot easily be used by
    new members of a development team to understand past design

    the integration of these techniques provides significant benefits over

    the confidence in these solvers and Coq 's automation; second,
    theorems established in interactive provers based on Higher-Order
    Logic can be exported to Coq and checked again, in order to offer the
    possibility to produce formal developments which mix these two
    different logical paradigms.  It ended up in two software : SMTCoq, a
    bi-directional cooperation between Coq and SAT/SMT solvers, and
    HOLLIGHTCOQ, a tool importing HOL Light theorems into Coq.
    
    For both tools, we took great care to define a modular and efficient
    architecture, based on three clearly separated ingredients: an
    embedding of the formalism of the external tool inside Coq which is
    carefully translated into Coq terms, a certified checker to establish
    the proofs using the certicates and a Ocaml preprocessor to transform
    proof witnesses coming from different provers into a generic
    certificate. This division allows that a change in the format of proof
    witnesses only affects the preprocessor, but no proved Coq code.

    computational reflection, which exploits the computational power of
    Coq to establish generic and small proofs based on the certicates.",

    "There is a large ecosystem of mathematical software systems. 
    Individually, these are optimized for particular domains and
    functionalities, and together they cover many needs of practical and
    theoretical mathematics. However, each system specializes on one area,
    and it remains very difficult to solve problems that need to involve
    multiple systems. Some integrations exist, but the are ad-hoc and have
    scalability and maintainability issues. In particular, there is not
    yet an interoperability layer that combines the various systems into a
    virtual research environment (VRE) for mathematics.
    
    The OpenDreamKit project aims at building a toolkit for such VREs. It
    suggests using a central system-agnostic formalization of mathematics

    "The G-Machine is an efficient implementation of lazy functional
    languages developed by Augustsson and Johnsson. This thesis may be
    read as a formal mathematical proof that the G-machine is correct with
    respect to a denotational semantic specification of a simple
    language. It also has more general implications. A simple lazy
    functional language is defined both denotationally and operationally;
    both are defined to handle erroneous results. The operational
    semantics models combinator graph reduction, and is based on reduction
    to weak head normal form. The two semantic definitions are shown to be
    congruent. Because of error handling the language is not
    confluent. Complete strictness is shown to be a necessary and
    sufficient condition for changing lazy function calls to strict
    ones. As strictness analyses are usually used with confluent
    languages, methods are discussed to restore this property. The
    operational semantic model uses indirection nodes to implement
    sharing. An alternative, which is without indirection nodes, is shown
    to be operationally equivalent for terminating programs. The G-machine
    is shown to be a representation of the combinator graph reduction
    operational model. It may be represented by the composition of a small
    set of combinators which correspond to an abstract machine instruction
    set. Using a modified form of graph isomorphism, alternative sequences
    of instructions are shown to be isomorphic, and hence may be used

    "Type inference, the process of assigning types to untyped
    expressions, may be motivated by the design of a typed language or
    semantical considerations on the meeaaings of types and expressions.
    A typed language GR with polymorphic functions leads to the GR
    inference rules. With the addition of an 'oracle' rule for equations
    between expressions, the GR rules become complete for a general class
    of semantic models of type inference. These inference models are
    models of untyped lambda calculus with extra structure similar to
    models of the typed language GR. A more specialized set of type
    inference rules, the GRS rules, characterize semantic typing when the
    functional type $a~$ , is interpreted as all elements of the model that
    map a to $~r$ and the polymorphic type $Vt,~0$ is interpreted as the
    intersection of all $o'(r)$. Both inference systems may be reformulated
    using rules for deducing containments between types. The advantage of
    the type inference rules based on containments is thatproofs

    "The standard reading of type theory through the lens of category
    theory is based on the idea of viewing a type system as a category

    rather than interpreting type systems as categories, we describe
    them as {\sl functors} from a category of typing derivations to a
    category of underlying terms. Then, turning this around, we
    explain how in fact {\sl any} functor gives rise to a generalized
    type system, with an abstract notion of type judgment, typing
    derivations and typing rules. This leads to a purely categorical
    reformulation of various natural classes of type systems as
    natural classes of functors.

    "Compilers for monomorphic languages, suc h as C and Pascal, take
    advantage of types to determine data representations, alignment,
    calling conventions, and register selection.  However, these languages
    lack important features including polymorphism, abstract datatypes,
    and garbage collection.  In contrast, modern programming languages
    such as Standard ML (SML), provide all of these features, but existing
    implementations fail to take full advantage of types.  The result is
    that performance of SML code is quite bad when compared to C.

    In this thesis, I provide a general framework, called 
    {\sl type-directed compilation}, that allows compiler writeres to
    take advantage of types at all stages in compilation. In the
    framework, types are used not only to determine efficient
    representations and calling conventions, but also to prove the
    correctness of the compiler. A key property of type-directed
    compilation is that all but the lowest levels of the compiler use
    {\sl typed intermediate languages}. An advantage of this approach
    is that it provides a means for automatically checking the
    integrity of the resulting code.

    An mportant contribution of this work is the development of a new,
    statically-typed intermediate language, called $\lambda^{ML}_i$.
    This language supports {\sl dynamic type dispatch}, providing a
    means to select operations based on types at run time. I show how
    to use dynamic type dispatch to support polymorphism, ad-hoc
    operators, and garbage collection without having to box or tag
    values. This allows compilers for SML to take advantage of
    techniques used in C compilers, without sacrificing language
    features or separate compilation.

    TO demonstrate the applicability of my approach, I, along with
    others, have constructed a new compiler for SML called TIL that
    eliminates most restrictions on the representations of values. The
    code produced by TIL is roughly twice as fast as code produced by
    the SML/NJ compiler. This is due to at least partially to the use
    of natural representations, but primarily to the conventional
    optimizer which manipulates typed, $\lambda^{ML}_i$ code. TIL
    demonstrates that combining type-directed compilation with dynamic
    type dispatch yields a superior architecture for compilers of
    modern languages.",

    "When a C programmer needs an efficient data structure for a
    particular problem, he or she can often simply look one up in any of
    a number of good textbooks or handbooks.  Unfortunately, programmers
    in functional languages such as Standard ML or Haskell do not have
    this luxury.  Although some data structures designed for imperative
    languages such as C can be quite easily adapted to a functional
    setting, most cannot, usually because they depend in crucial ways on
    assignments, which are disallowed, or at least discouraged, in
    functional languages.  To address this imbalance, we describe several
    techniques for designing functional data structures, and numerous
    original data structures based on these techniques, including multiple
    variations of lists, queues, double-ended queues, and heaps, many
    supporting more exotic features such as random access or efficient
    catenation.

    In addition, we expose the fundamental role of lazy evaluation in
    amortized functional data structures.  Traditional methods of
    amortization break down when old versions of a data structure, not
    just the most recent, are available for further processing.  This
    property is known as persistence , and is taken for granted in
    functional languages.  On the surface, persistence and amortization
    appear to be incompatible, but we show how lazy evaluation can be used
    to resolve this conflict, yielding amortized data structures that are
    efficient even when used persistently.  Turning this relationship
    between lazy evaluation and amortization around, the notion of
    amortization also provides the first practical techniques for
    analyzing the time requirements of non-trivial lazy programs.

    Finally, our data structures offer numerous hints to programming
    language designers, illustrating the utility of combining strict and
    lazy evaluation in a single language, and providing non-trivial

    programming languages, the {\sl coercive typed $\lambda$-calculi},

    choosing the linguistic constants (i.e. generators) of $L$, we can
    view phrases of variants of ALGOL as syntactically sugared phrases
    of $L$.

    This dissertation breaks into three parts. In the first part,
    consisting of the first chapter, we supply basic definitions and
    motivate the idea that functor categories arise naturally in the
    explanation of block structure and stack discipline. The second
    part, consisting of the next three chapters, is dedicated to the
    general theory of the semantics of the coercive typed
    $\lambda$-calculus; the interplay between posets, algebras, and
    Cartesian closed categories is particularly intense here. The
    remaining four chapters make up the final part, in which we apply
    the general theory to give both direct and continuation semantics

    certain functor categories are Cartesian closed and to describe a

    represented as expansion proofs, $H$ , a form of the sequent calculus we
    define, non-analytic proofs are represented by natural deductions. A
    non-deterministic translation algorithm between expansion proofs and 
    $H$-deductions is presented and its correctness is proven. We also
    present an algorithm for translation in the other direction and prove
    its correctness. A cut-elimination algorithm for expansion proofs is
    given and its partial correctness is proven. Strong termination of
    this algorithm remains a conjecture for the full higher-order
    system, but is proven for the first-order fragment. We extend the
    translations to a non-analytic proof system which contains a primitive
    notion of equality, while leaving the notion of expansion proof
    unaltered. This is possible, since a non-extensional equality is
    definable in our system of type theory. Next we extend analytic and
    non-analytic proof systems and the translations between them to
    include extensionality.  Finally, we show how the methods and notions
    used so far apply to the problem of translating expansion proofs into
    natural deductions. Much care is taken to specify this translation in
    a modular way (through tactics) which leaves a large number of choices
    and therefore a lot of room for heuristics to produce elegant natural
    deductions. A practically very useful extension, called symmetric
    simplification, produces natural deductions which make use of lemmas

    Extended Calculus of Constructions and two of its subsystems. LEGO
    also supports the extension of these three systems with inductive
    types. These type systems can be viewed as logics, and as meta
    languages for expressing logics, and LEGO is intended to be used for
    interactively constructing proofs in mathematical theories presented
    in these logics. I have developed LEGO over six years, starting from
    an implementation of the Calculus of Constructions by Gerard
    Huet. LEGO has been used for problems at the limits of our abilities
    to do formal mathematics.  

    In this thesis I explain some aspects of the meta-theory of LEGO’s
    type systems leading to a machine-checked proof that typechecking is
    decidable for all three type theories supported by LEGO, and to a
    verified algorithm for deciding their typing judgements, assuming only
    that they are normalizing. In order to do this, the theory of Pure
    Type Systems (PTS) is extended and formalized in LEGO. This extended
    example of a formally developed body of mathematics is described, both
    for its main theorems, and as a case study in formal mathematics. In
    many examples, I compare formal definitions and theorems with their
    informal counterparts, and with various alternative approaches, to
    study the meaning and use of mathematical language, and suggest
    clarifications in the informal usage.

    Having outlined a formal development far too large to be surveyed in
    detail by a human reader, I close with some thoughts on how the human
    mathematician’s state of understanding and belief might be affected by
    posessing such a thing.",

    actually normalize them. There are problems to be worked out in
    practice, such as extraction of programs from constructive proof, and
    efficient execution of pure, total programs. Although this approach
    doesn't address the difficulty of proving correctness of tactics in
    the meta level, it is immediatly useful for tactics with structural
    justification (e.g. weakening) which are not even representable in
    LCF, and are infeasible in the Nuprl variant of LCF. Since it can be
    used for any object system without adding new principles such as
    reflection, and is compatible with other approaches to extensibility

    type inequalities, rather than equalities. However, the number of
    such inequalities is linear in the program size -- whence, from a
    practical point of view, a serious efficiency and readability
    problem. 

    To solve this problem, one must simplify the inferred
    constraints. So, after studying the logical properties of
    subtyping constraints, this work proposes several simplifcation
    algorithms. They combine seamlessly, yielding a homogeneous, fully
    formal framework, which directly leads to an efficient

    Systems (PTSs).  We show how we can define such a language by
    extending the PTS framework with algebraic data types, case
    expressions and definitions. To be able to experiment with our
    language we present an implementation of a type checker and an
    interpreter for our language.  PTSs are well suited as a basis for a
    functional programming language because they are at the top of a
    hierarchy of increasingly stronger type systems. The concepts of
    `existential types', `rank-n polymorphism' and `dependent types' arise
    naturally in functional programming languages based on the systems in
    this hierarchy. There is no need for ad-hoc extensions to incorporate
    these features.  The type system of our language is more powerful than
    the Hindley-Milner system.  We illustrate this fact by giving a number
    of meaningful programs that cannot be typed in Haskell but are typable
    in our language. A `real world' example of such a program is the
    mapping of a specialisation of a Generic Haskell function to a Haskell
    function.  Unlike the description of the Henk language by Simon Peyton

    problems, is a superintelligent AI system that only answers questions.
    The aim of this manuscript is to survey contemporary research problems
    related to oracles which align with long-term research goals of AI
    safety.  We examine existing question answering systems and argue that
    their high degree of architectural heterogeneity makes them poor
    candidates for rigorous analysis as oracles.  On the other hand, we
    identify computer algebra systems (CASs) as being primitive examples
    of domain-specific oracles for mathematics and argue that efforts to
    integrate computer algebra systems with theorem provers, systems which
    have largely been developed independent of one another, provide a
    concrete set of problems related to the notion of provable safety that
    has emerged in the AI safety community.  We review approaches to
    interfacing CASs with theorem provers, describe well-defined
    architectural deficiencies that have been identified with CASs, and

    "Though Haskell's module language is quite weak, its core language
    is highly expressive. Indeed, it is tantalisingly close to being
    able to express much of the structure traditionally delegated to a
    separate module language. However, the encoding are awkward, and
    some situations can't be encoded at all.

    In this paper we refine Haskell's core language to support 
    {\sl first-class modules} with many of the features of ML-style
    modules. Our proposal cleanly encodes signatures, structures and
    functors with the appropriate type abstraction and type sharing,
    and supports recursive modules. All of these features work across
    compilation units, and interact harmoniously with Haskell's class
    system. Coupled with support for staged computation, we believe
    our proposal would be an elegant approach to run-time dynamic
    linking of structured code.

    Our work builds directly upon Jones' work on parameterised
    signatures, Odersky and Laufer's system of higher-ranked type
    annotations, Russo's semantics of ML modules using ordinary
    existential and universal quantifications, and Odersky and
    Zenger's work on nested types. We motivate the system by examples,

    "We have developed a compiler for the lexically-scoped dialect of LISP
    known as SCHEME. The compiler knows relatively little about specific
    data manipulation primitives such as arithmetic operators, but
    concentrates on general issues of environment and control. Rather than
    having specialized knowledge about a large variety of control and
    environment constructs, the compiler handles only a small basis set
    which reflects the semantics of lambda-calculus. All of the
    traditional imperative constructs, such as sequencing, assignment,
    looping, GOTO, as well as many standard LISP constructs such as AND,
    OR, and COND, are expressed in macros in terms of the applicative
    basis set. A small number of optimization techniques, coupled with the
    treatment of function calls as GOTO statements, serve to produce code
    as good as that produced by more traditional compilers. The macro
    approach enables speedy implementation of new constructs as desired
    without sacrificing efficiency in the generated code. 
    
    A fair amount of analysis is devoted to determining whether
    environments may be stack-allocated or must be heap-allocated.
    Heap-allocated environments are necessary in general because SCHEME
    (unlike Algol 60 and Algol 68, for example) allows procedures with
    free lexically scoped variables to be returned as the values of other
    procedures; the Algol stack-allocation environment strategy does not
    suffice. The methods used here indicate that a heap-allocating
    generalization of the 'display' technique leads to an efficient
    implementation of such 'upward funargs'. Moreover, compile-time
    optimization and analysis can eliminate many 'funargs' entirely, and
    so far fewer environment structures need be allocated at run time than
    might be expected.
    
    A subset of SCHEME (rather than triples, for example) serves as the
    representation intermediate between the optimized SCHEME code and the
    final output code; code is expressed in this subset in the so-called
    continuation-passing style. As a subset of SCHEME, it enjoys the same
    theoretical properties; one could even apply the same optimizer used
    on the input code to the intermediate code. However, the subset is so
    chosen that all temporary quantities are made manifest as variables,
    and no control stack is needed to evaluate it. As a result, this
    apparently applicative representation admits an imperative
    interpretation which permits easy transcription to final imperative
    machine code. These qualities suggest that an applicative language
    like SCHEME is a better candidate for an UNCOL than the more
    imperative candidates proposed to date.",

    We explore the consequences of various variable binding
    disciplines and the introduction of side effects. We find that
    dynamic scoping is unsuitable for constructing procedural
    abstractions, but has another role as an agent of modularity,
    being a structured form of side effect. More general side effects
    are also found to be necessary to promote modular style. We find
    that the notion of side effect and the notion of equality (object
    identity) are mutually constraining; to define one is to define
    the other.

    The interpreters we exhibit are all written in a simple dialect of

    Unfortunately, there are some little-known pitfalls in

    Compare the value of $(z^2 + z^3)^{3/2}$  with that of its 
    truncated series expansion about $z = 0$, approximated at

    Compare the value of $ln(z^2 + z^3)$ with its truncated series

    \begin{quote}
      There are very clever 'thinking machines' in existence today,
      such as Watson, the IBM computer that conquered {\sl Jeopardy!}
      last year. But next to Eureqa, Watson is merely a glorified
      search engine.
    \end{quote}
    
    The program is designed to work with noisy experimental data,
    searching for then returning a set of result expressions that
    attempt to optimally trade off conciseness with accuracy.

    However, if the data is generated from a formula for which there
    exists more concise equivalent formulas, sometimes some of the
    candidate Eureqa expressions are one or more of those more concise
    equivalents expressions. If not, perhaps one or more of the
    returned Eureqa expressions might be a sufficiently accurate
    approximation that is more concise than the given
    formula. Moreover, when there is no known closed form expression,
    the data points can be generated by numerical methods, enabling
    Eureqa to find expressions that concisely fit those data points
    with sufficient accuracy. In contrast to typical regression
    software, the user does not have to explicitly or implicitly
    provide a specific expression or class of expressions containing
    unknown constants for the software to determine.

    Is Eureqa useful enough in these regards to provide an additional
    tool for experimental mathematics, computer algebra users and
    numerical analysts? Yes, if used carefully. Can computer algebra
    and numerical methods help Eureqa? Definitely.",

    "When scripts in untyped languages grow into large programs,

    wish to change a program. This analysis step both slows down the
    maintenance process and may even introduce mistakes due to the
    violation of undiscovered invariants.
    
    This paper presents Typed Scheme, an explicitly typed extension of PLT
    Scheme, an untyped scripting language. Its type system is based on
    the novel notion of occurrence typing, which we formalize and
    mechanically prove sound. The implementation of Typed Scheme
    additionally borrows elements from a range of approaches, including
    recursive types, true unions and subtyping, plus polymorphism combined
    with a modicum of local inference.
    
    The formulation of occurrence typing naturally leads to a simple and
    expressive version of predicates to describe refinement types. A
    Typed Scheme program can use these refinement types to keep track of
    arbitrary classes of values via the type system. Further, we show how
    the Typed Scheme type system, in conjunction with simple recursive
    types, is able to encode refinements of existing datatypes, thus
    expressing both proposed variations of refinement types.",

    Possible approaches to this problem are discussed. Topology seems to

    branches of constructive mathematics and classical mathematics
    (‘reuniting the antipodes’).  We give a simplification of basic
    intuitionistic theory, especially with regard to so-called ‘bar
    induction’.  We then plead for a limited number of axiomatic systems,
    which differentiate between the various branches of mathematics.
    Finally, in the appendix we offer bish an elegant topological

    is equivalent to the usual classical and/or intuitionistic definition

    "This paper addresses the crucial issue in the design of a proof
    development system of how to deal with partial functions and the
    related question of how to treat undefined terms. Often the problem is
    avoided by artificially making all functions total. However, that does
    not correspond to the practice of everyday mathematics.

    In type theory partial functions are modeled by giving functions extra
    arguments which are proof objects. In that case it will not be
    possible to apply functions outside their domain. However, having
    proofs as first class objects has the disadvantage that it will be
    unfamiliar to most mathematicians. Also many proof tools (like the
    theorem prover Otter) will not be usable for such a logic. Finally
    expressions get difficult to read because of these proof objects.

    The PVS system solves the problem of partial functions
    differently. PVS generates type-correctness conditions (TCCs) for
    statements in its language. These are proof obligations that have to
    be satisfied ‘on the side’ to show that statements are well-formed.

    We propose a TCC-like approach for the treatment of partial functions
    in type theory. We add domain conditions (DCs) to classical
    first-order logic and show the equivalence with a first order system

    right questions are: What’s different between us and the other
    primates and what’s the same.  I answer the {\sl what’s different}
    question by saying that we became symbolic in a way that enabled
    story understanding, directed perception, and easy communication,
    and other species did not. I argue against Turing’s
    reasoning-centered suggestions, offering that reasoning is just a
    special case of story understanding. I answer the {\sl what’s the
    same} question by noting that our brains are largely engineered in
    the same exotic way, with information flowing in all directions at
    once. By way of example, I illustrate how these answers can
    influence a research program, describing the Genesis system, a
    system that works with short summaries of stories, provided in
    English, together with low-level {\sl common-sense rules} and
    higher-level {\sl concept patterns}, likewise expressed in
    English. Genesis answers questions, notes abstract concepts such
    as {\sl revenge}, tells stories in a listener-aware way, and fills

    "We present an approach to enriching the type system of ML with a
    restricted form of dependent types, where type index objects are drawn
    from a constraint domain C , leading to the DML( C ) language schema.
    This allows specification and inference of significantly more precise
    type information, facilitating program error detection and compiler
    optimization.  A major complication resulting from introducing
    dependent types is that pure type inference for the enriched system is
    no longer possible, but we show that type-checking a suciently
    annotated program in DML( C ) can be reduced to constraint
    satisfaction in the constraint domain C .  We exhibit the 
    un-obtrusiveness of our approach through practical examples and prove
    that DML( C ) is conservative over ML. The main contribution of the
    paper lies in our language design, including the formulation of
    type-checking rules which makes the approach practical.  To our
    knowledge, no previous type system for a general purpose programming
    language such as ML has combined dependent types with features including
    datatype declarations, higher-order functions, general recursions,
    let-polymorphism, mutable references, and exceptions.  In addition,
    we have finished a prototype implementation of DML( C ) for an integer
    constraint domain C , where constraints are linear inequalities (Xi

    "Coercive subtyping is a useful and powerful framework of subtyping
    for type theories.  In this thesis, we point out the problem in the
    old formulation of coercive subtyping in [Luo99], give a new and
    adequate formulation $T[C]$, the system that extends a type theory $T$
    with coercive subtyping based on a set $C$ of basic subtyping
    judgements, and show that coercive subtyping is a conservative
    extension and, in a more general sense, a definitional extension.
    
    We introduce an intermediate system, the star-calculus $T[C]^∗$ , in
    which the positions that require coercion insertions are marked, and
    show that $T[C]^∗$ is a conservative extension of $T$ and that $T[C]^*$
    is equivalent to $T[C]$.  Further more, in order to capture all the
    properties of the coercive subtyping framework, we introduce another
    intermediate system $T[C]_{0K}$ which does not contain the coercion
    application rules.  We show that $T[C]^∗$ is actually a definitional
    extension of $T[C]_{0K}$, which is a conservative extension of $T$.
    This makes clear what we mean by coercive subtyping being a
    conservative extension and amends a technical problem that has led to
    a gap in the earlier conservativity proof.
    
    Another part of the work in this thesis concerns the implementation of
    coercive subtyping in the proof assistant Plastic.  Coercive subtyping
    was implemented in Plastic by Paul Callaghan [CL01].  We have done
    some improvement based on that work, fixed some problems of Plastic,
    and implemented a new kind of data type called {\sl dot-types}, which are
    special data types useful in formal semantics to describe interesting
    linguistic phenomena such as copredication, in Plastic.",

    "An old and celebrated analogy says that writing programs is like
    proving theorems. This analogy has been productive in both
    directions, but in particular has demonstrated remarkable utility in
    driving progress in programming languages, for example leading towards
    a better understanding of concepts such as abstract data types and
    polymorphism.  One of the best known instances of the analogy actually
    rises to the level of an isomorphism: between Gentzen’s natural
    deduction and Church’s lambda calculus.  However, as has been
    recognized for a while, lambda calculus fails to capture some of the
    important features of modern programming languages. Notably, it does
    not have an inherent notion of evaluation order, needed to make sense
    of programs with side effects. Instead, the historical descendents of
    lambda calculus (languages like Lisp, ML, Haskell, etc.) impose
    evaluation order in an ad hoc way.

    This thesis aims to give a fresh take on the proofs-as-programs
    analogy—one which better accounts for features of modern programming
    languages—by starting from a different logical foundation.  Inspired
    by Andreoli’s focusing proofs for linear logic, we explain how to
    axiomatize certain canonical forms of logical reasoning through a
    notion of pattern.  Propositions come with an intrinsic polarity,
    based on whether they are defined by patterns of proof, or by patterns
    of refutation.  Applying the analogy, we then obtain a programming
    language with built-in support for pattern-matching, in which
    evaluation order is explicitly reflected at the level of types—and
    hence can be controlled locally, rather than being an ad hoc, global
    policy decision. As we show, different forms of continuation-passing
    style (one of the historical tools for analyzing evaluation order)
    can be described in terms of different polarizations.  This language
    provides an elegant, uniform account of both untyped and
    intrinsically-typed computation (incorporating ideas from infinitary
    proof theory), and additionally, can be provided an extrinsic type
    system to express and statically enforce more refined properties of
    programs. We conclude by using this framework to explore the theory of
    typing and subtyping for intersection and union types in the presence
    of effects, giving a simplified explanation of some of the unusual
    artifacts of existing systems.",

    advent of powerful computer architectures, a new research line started
    to develop practically feasible implementations of such decision
    procedures. Since then, symbolic computation has grown to an extremely
    successful scientific area, supporting all kinds of scientific
    computing by efficient computer algebra systems.
    
    Independently, around 1960 a new technology called SAT solving started

    be very efficient when employed by formal methods for verification. It

    had been extended to cover also different theories. Nowadays, fast
    SAT-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers are available also for arithmetic
    problems.

  abstract =
    "This thesis presents a type system which supports the strong static
    type checking of programs developed in an applicative subset of the
    Common Lisp language. The Lisp subset is augmented with a guard
    construct for function definitions, which allows type restrictions to
    be placed on the arguments. Guards support the analysis and safe use
    of partial functions, like CAR, which are well-defined only for
    arguments of a certain type.

    A language of type descriptors characterizes the type
    domain. Descriptors are composed into function signatures which
    characterize the guard and which map various combinations of actual
    parameter types to possible result types. From a base of signatures
    for a small collection of primitive functions, the system infers
    signatures for newly submitted functions.

    The system includes a type inference algorithm which handles
    constructs beyond the constraints of ML-style systems. Most notable
    are the free use of CONS to construct objects of undeclared type and
    the use of IF forms whose two result components have unrelated types,
    resulting in ad hoc polymorphism. Accordingly, the type descriptor
    language accommodates disjunction, unrestricted CONS, recursive type
    forms, and ad hoc polymorphic function signatures. As with traditional
    type inference systems, unification is a central algorithm, but the
    richness of our type language complicates many component algorithms,
    including unification. Special treatment is given to recognizer
    functions, which are predicates determining whether an object is of a
    particular type. Type inference in this setting is undecidable, so the
    algorithm is heuristic and is not complete.

    The semantics of the system are in terms of a function which
    determines whether values satisfy descriptors with respect to a
    binding of type variables. The soundness of each signature emitted by
    the system is validated by a signature checker, whose properties are
    formally specified with respect to the formal semantics and proven to
    hold. The checker algorithm is substantially simpler than the
    inference algorithm, as it need not perform operations such as
    discovering closed recursive forms. Thus, its proof is both more
    straightforward to construct and easier to validate than a direct
    proof of the inference algorithm would be.",

    may depend on other components. Cayenne also combines the 
    syntactic categories for value expressions and type expressions thus
    reducing the number of language concepts. 
    
    Having dependent types
    and combined type and value expressions makes the language very
    powerful. It is powerful enough that a special module concept
    is unnecessary; ordinary records suffice. It is also powerful enough to
    encode predicate logic at the type level allowing types to be
    used as specifications of programs. However this power comes at a
    cost: type checking of Cayenne is undecidable. While this may
    appear to be a steep price to pay it seems to work well in practice.",

    "Is the use of computer algebra technology beneficial for
    mechanised reasoining in and about mathematical domains? Usually
    it is assumed that it is. Many works in this area, however, either
    have little reasoning conent, or use symbolic computation only to
    simplify expressions. In work that has achieved more, the used
    methods do not scale up. They trust the computer algebra system
    either too much or too little.

    Computer algebra systems are not as rigorous as many provers. They
    are not logically sound reasoning systems, but collections of
    algorithms. We classify soundness problems that occur in computer
    algebra systems. While many algorithms and their implementations
    are perfectly trustworthy, the semantics of symbols is often
    unclear and leads to errors. On the other hand, more robust
    approaches to interface external reasoners to provers are not
    always practical because the mathematical depth of proofs
    algorithms in computer algebra are based on can be enormous.

    Our own approach takes both trustworthiness of the overall system
    and efficiency into account. It relies on using only reliable
    parts of a computer algebra system, which can be achieved by
    choosing a suitable library, and deriving specifications for these
    algorithms from their literature.

    We design and implement an interface between the prover Isabelle
    and the computer algebra library Sumit and use it to prove
    non-trivial theorems from coding theory. This is based on the
    mechanisation of the algebraic theories of rings and
    polynomials. Coding theory is an area where proofs do have a
    substantial amount of computational content. Also, it is realistic
    to assume that the verification of an encoding or decoding device
    could be undertaken in, and indeed, be simplified by, such a
    system. 

    The reason why semantics of symbols is often unclear in current
    computer algebra systems is not mathematical difficulty, but the
    design of those systems. For Gaussian elimination we show how the
    soundness problem can be fixed by a small extension, and without
    losing efficiency. This is a prerequisite for the efficient use of
    the algorithm in a prover.",

    examples of both categories are stand alone special purpose systems

    We will argue that the present state of the art in logic is such that
    there is a natural formal language, independent of the special purpose
    application in question, by which these systems can communicate
    mathematical statements. In this way their individual power will be

    come from the other site or from the local site itself, but in both
    cases it is verified locally.  In cases where there is no evidence of
    impeccability one has to rely on cross checking. There is a trade-off

    excellent handling of equality) and also the power of lambda
    unification. We illustrate how these capabilities work well together
    by using Otter-lambda to find proofs by mathematical induction. Lambda
    unification instantiates the induction schema to find a useful
    instance of induction, and then Otter's first-order reasoning can be
    used to carry out the base case and induction step. If necessary,
    induction can be used for those, too. We present and discuss a variety
    of examples of inductive proofs found by Otter-lambda: some in pure
    Peano arithmetic, some in Peano arithmetic with defined predicates,
    some in theories combining algebra and the natural numbers, some
    involving algebraic simplification (used in the induction step) by
    simplification code from MathXpert, and some involving list induction
    instead of numerical induction. These examples demonstrate the
    feasibility and usefulness of adding lambda unification to a
    first-order prover.",

  abstract =
    "The HOL system is a fully-expansive theorem prover: Proofs generated
    in the system are composed of applications of the primitive inference
    rules of the underlying logic. This has two main advantages. First,
    the soundness of the system depends only on the implementations of the
    primitive rules. Second, users can be given the freedom to write their
    own proof procedures without the risk of making the system unsound. A
    full functional programming language is provided for this purpose. The
    disadvantage with the approach is that performance is
    compromised. This is partly due to the inherent cost of fully
    expanding a proof but, as demonstrated in this thesis, much of the
    observed inefficiency is due to the way the derived proof procedures
    are written. This thesis seeks to identify sources of non-inherent
    inefficiency in the HOL system and proposes some general-purpose and
    some specialised techniques for eliminating it. One area that seems to
    be particularly amenable to optimisation is equational reasoning. This
    is significant because equational reasoning constitutes large portions
    of many proofs. A number of techniques are proposed that transparently
    optimise equational reasoning. Existing programs in the HOL system
    require little or no modification to work faster. The other major
    contribution of this thesis is a framework in which part of the
    computation involved in HOL proofs can be postponed. This enables
    users to make better use of their time. The technique exploits a form
    of lazy evaluation. The critical feature is the separation of the code
    that generates the structure of a theorem from the code that justifies
    it logically. Delaying the justification allows some non-local
    optimisations to be performed in equational reasoning. None of the
    techniques sacrifice the security of the fully-expansive approach. A
    decision procedure for a subset of the theory of linear arithmetic is
    used to illustrate many of the techniques. Decision procedures for
    this theory are commonplace in theorem provers due to the importance
    of arithmetic reasoning. The techniques described in the thesis have
    been implemented and execution times are given. The implementation of
    the arithmetic procedure is a major contribution in itself. For the
    first time, users of the HOL system are able to prove many arithmetic
    lemmas automatically in a practical amount of time (typically a second
    or two). The applicability of the techniques to other fully-expansive
    theorem provers and possile extensions of the ideas are considered."

    "We discuss the problem of incorporating into a heuristic theorem
    prover a decision procedure for a fragment of the logic.  An obvious
    goal when incorporating such a procedure is to reduce the search space
    explored by the heuristic component of the system, as would be
    achieved by eliminating from the system’s data base some explicitly
    stated axioms.  For example, if a decision procedure for linear
    inequalities is added, one would hope to eliminate the explicit
    consideration of the transitivity axioms.  However, the decision
    procedure must then be used in all the ways the eliminated axioms
    might have been.  The difficulty of achieving this degree of
    integration is more dependent upon the complexity of the heuristic
    component than upon that of the decision procedure.  The view of the
    decision procedure as a ``black box'' is frequently destroyed by the
    need pass large amounts of search strategic information back and forth
    between the two components.  Finally, the efficiency of the decision
    procedure may be virtually irrelevant; the efficiency of the final
    system may depend most heavily on how easy it is to communicate
    between the two components.  This paper is a case study of how we
    integrated a linear arithmetic procedure into a heuristic theorem
    prover.  By linear arithmetic here we mean the decidable subset of

    particular, now that computers are no longer the exclusive
    playground for highly educated scientists, usability is now more
    important than ever, and justifiably so.  

    I will also examine what I see as some principal failings of
    current systems, primarily to understand some major mistakes to
    avoid. These failings will be analyzed to extract what seems to be
    the root mistake, and I will present my favourite solutions.

    Furthermore, various technologies have matured since the creation
    of many of our systems, and whenever appropriate, these should be
    used. For example, our understanding of the structure of
    mathematics has significantly increased, yet this is barely
    reflected in our libraries. The extreme focus on efficiency by the
    computer algebra community, and correctness by the (interactive)
    theorem proving community should no longer be considered viable
    long term strategies.  But how does one effectively bridge that
    gap?  

    I personally find that a number of (programming) language-based
    solutions are particularly effective, and I will emphasize
    these. Solutions to some of these problems will be illustrated
    with code from a prototype of MathScheme 2.0, the system I am
    developing with Bill Farmer and our research group.",

    "Decomposing the domain of a function into parts has many uses in
    mathematics. A domain may naturally be a union of pieces, a

    may hold on different regions. For any particular problem the
    domain can be given explicitly, but when dealing with a family of
    problems given in terms of symbolic parameters, matters become
    more difficult. This article shows how hybrid sets, that is
    multisets allowing negative multiplicity, may be used to express
    symbolic domain decompositions in an efficient, elegant and

    "The benefits of formal correctness proofs for software are clear
    intuitively, but the high human costs of proof construction have
    generally been viewed as prohibitive. To support that integration, we
    need to rethink the familiar programming toolchains. The new world
    needn't be all about doing prodigious extra work to achieve the virtue
    of correct programs; formal methods also suggest new programming
    approaches that better support abstraction and modularity than do
    coarser-grained specification styles like normal static types. This
    talk overviews Bedrock, a framework for certified programming inside
    of the Coq proof assistant. Bedrock programs are implemented,
    specified, verified, and compiled inside of Coq. A single program may
    be divided into modules with formal interfaces, written in different
    programming languages and verified with different proof styles. The
    common foundation is an assembly language with an operational
    semantics (serving as the trusted code base) and a semantic module
    system (orchestrating linking of code and proofs across source
    languages). A few different programming styles have been connects to
    the shared foundation, including a C-like language with an ``array of
    bytes'' memory model, higher-level more C++-like languages with ``array
    of abstract data types'' memory models, a domain-specific language for
    XML processing, standard Coq functional programs, and even declarative
    specifications that are refined automatically into assembly code with
    correctness proofs. The talk will present Bedrock's shared foundation
    and sketch the pieces that go into refining declarative specifications
    into closed assembly programs, covering joint work with Thomas
    Braibant, Santiago Cuellar, Benjamin Delaware, Jason Gross, Gregory

    {\sl normalization function}, that is, the function which maps a term into
    its normal form.
    
    Such a normalization function can be constructed by building an
    appropriate model and a function ``quote'' which inverts the
    interpretation function. The normalization function is then obtained
    by composing the quote function with the interpretation function. We
    also discuss how to gt a simple proof of the property that
    constructors are one-to-one, which usually is obtained as a corollary
    of Church-Rosser and normalization in the traditional sense.
    
    We illustrate this approach by showing how a glueing model (closely

    rise to a normalization algorithm for a combinatory formlation of
    Godel System T. We then show how the method extends in a

    Two languages are defined, one total and one partial, with identical

    spaces. A partial equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the
    domain of which is the total subset of the partial language. For types

    functions are related if they map related values to related values.

    It is proved that if two closed terms have the same semantics in the

    large collection of commonly occuring inductive data structures. It also
    includes a variety of universes which are constructive analogues of 
    inaccessibles and other large cardinals below the first Mahlo cardinal.
    In this article we give a new compact formalization of inductive-recursive
    definnitions by modeling them as initial algebras in slice categories. We
    give generic formation, introduction, elimination, and equality rules
    generalizing the usual rules of type theory. Moreover, we prove that the

    induction-recursion as a reflection principle given in Dybjer and
    Setzer (Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 2183 (2001) 93). Finally we discuss
    two type-theoretic analogues of Mahlo cardinals in set theory: an external
    Mahlo universe which is defined by induction-recursion and captured by our
    formalization, and an internal Mahlo universe, which goes beyond induction-
    recursion. We show that the external Mahlo universe, and therefore also

    converting incrementally to use more efficient forms. Frequent symbolic

    discourse between low-level proof methods and the logic of scientific

    justification of an algorithm typically relies on algebra or analysis,
    but the correctness of the program requires that the arithmetic
    expressions are written correctly and that iterations converge to
    correct values in spite of truncation of infinite processes or series
    and the commission of numerical roundoff errors. We hope to help
    bridge this gap by showing how we can, in some cases, state a
    high-level requirement and by using a computer algebra system (CAS)
    demonstrate that a program satisfies that requirement. A CAS can
    contribute program manipulation, partial evaluation, simplification or
    other algorithmic methods. A novelty here is that we add to the usual
    list of techniques automatic differentiation, a method already widely

    throughout is the possibility of representation theorems (aka
    completeness theorems or embedding theorems) for various categorical
    structures, spanning back now about five decades (as of this writing)
    to the original embedding theorems for abelian categories, such as the
    Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem.

    "The Calculus of Constructions (CC) is a typed lambda calculus for

    calculus, and a first order dependent typed lambda calculus in the
    style of de Bruijn's Automath or Martin-Lof's intuitionistic theory

    the Calculus of Constructions thus becomes a higher order language for
    the typing of functional programs. We shall introduce and try to
    explain CC by exploiting especially the first point of view, by
    introducing a typed lambda calculus that faithfully represent higher
    order predicate logic (so for this system the Curry-Howard
    'formuals-as-types isomorphism' is really an isomorphism.) Then we
    discuss some propositions that are provable in CC but not in the

    Algebra has been formalized in Coq.

    The algebraic hierarchy that is described here is both abstract and
    structured. Structures like groups and rings are port of it in an
    abstract way, defining e.g. a ring as a tuple consisting of a group, a
    binary operation and a constant that together satisfy the properties
    of a ring. In this way, a ring automatically inherits the group
    properties of the additive subgroup. The algebraic hierarchy is
    formalized in Coq by applying a combination of labeled record types
    and coercions. In the labeled record types of Coq, one can use 
    {\sl dependent types}: the type of one label may depend on another
    label. This allows to give a type to a dependent-typed tuple like
    $\langle A, f, a \rangle$, where $A$ is a set, $f$ an operation on $A$
    and $a$ an element of $A$. Coercions are functions that are used
    implicitly (they are inferred by the type checker) and allow, for
    example, to use the structure $\mathcal{A} := \langle A, f, a \rangle$
    as a synonym or the carrier set $A$, as is often done in mathematical
    practice. Apart rom the inheritance and reuse of properties, the
    algebraic hierarchy has proven very useful for reusing notations.",

    nearly 2.4 million LLVM instructions per second on a typical laptop

    "One way to ensure correctness of the inference performed by computer
    theorem provers is to force all proofs to be done step by step in a
    simple, more or less traditional, deductive system. Using techniques
    pioneered in Edinburgh LCF, this can be made palatable. However, some
    believe such an approach will never be efficient enough for large,
    complex proofs. One alternative, commonly called reflection, is to
    analyze proofs using a second layer of logic, a metalogic, and so
    justify abbreviating or simplifying proofs, making the kinds of
    shortcuts humans often do or appealing to specialized decision
    algorithms. In this paper we contrast the fully-expansive LCF approach
    with the use of reflection. We put forward arguments to suggest that
    the inadequacy of the LCF approach has not been adequately
    demonstrated, and neither has the practical utility of reflection
    (notwithstanding its undoubted intellectual interest). The LCF system
    with which we are most concerned is the HOL proof assistant.
    
    The plan of the paper is as follows. We examine ways of providing user
    extensibility for theorem provers, which naturally places the LCF and
    reflective approaches in opposition. A detailed introduction to LCF is
    provided, emphasizing ways in which it can be made efficient. Next, we
    present a short introduction to metatheory and its usefulness, and,
    starting from Gödel's proofs and Feferman's transfinite progressions
    of theories, look at logical `reflection principles'. We show how to
    introduce computational `reflection principles' which do not extend
    the power of the logic, but may make deductions in it more efficient,
    and speculate about their practical usefulness. Applications or
    proposed applications of computational reflection in theorem proving
    are surveyed, following which we draw some conclusions. In an
    appendix, we attempt to clarify a couple of other notions of
    `reflection' often encountered in the literature.
    
    The paper questions the too-easy acceptance of reflection principles
    as a practical necessity. However I hope it also serves as an adequate
    introduction to the concepts involved in reflection and a survey of
    relevant work. To this end, a rather extensive bibliography is

    areas, such as the verification of floating point hardware and hybrid
    systems. It also allows the formalization of many more branches of
    classical mathematics, which is particularly relevant for attempts to
    inject more rigour into computer algebra systems.
    
    Our work is conducted in a version of the HOL theorem prover. We
    describe the rigorous definitional construction of the real numbers,
    using a new version of Cantor's method, and the formalization of a
    significant portion of real analysis. We also describe an advanced
    derived decision procedure for the `Tarski subset' of real algebra as
    well as some more modest but practically useful tools for automating
    explicit calculations and routine linear arithmetic reasoning.
    
    Finally, we consider in more detail two interesting application
    areas. We discuss the desirability of combining the rigour of theorem
    provers with the power and convenience of computer algebra systems,
    and explain a method we have used in practice to achieve this. We then
    move on to the verification of floating point hardware. After a
    careful discussion of possible correctness specifications, we report
    on two case studies, one involving a transcendental function.
    
    We aim to show that a theory of real numbers is useful in practice and
    interesting in theory, and that the `LCF style' of theorem proving is
    well suited to the kind of work we describe. We hope also to convince
    the reader that the kind of mathematics needed for applications is
    well within the abilities of current theorem proving technology.",

    This thesis describes substantial enhancements that were made to the
    software tools in the Nuprl system that are used to interactively
    guide the production of formal proofs. Over 20,000 lines of code were
    written for these tools. Also, a corpus of formal mathematics was
    created that consists of roughly 500 definitions and 1300
    theorems. Much of this material is of a foundational nature and
    supports all current work in Nuprl. This thesis concentrates on
    describing the half of this corpus that is concerned with abstract
    algebra and that covers topics central to the mathematics of the
    computations carried out by computer algebra systems.
    
    The new proof tools include those that solve linear arithmetic
    problems, those that apply the properties of order relations, those
    that carry out inductive proof to support recursive definitions, and
    those that do sophisticated rewriting. The rewrite tools allow
    rewriting with relations of differing strengths and take care of
    selecting and applying appropriate congruence lemmas automatically.
    The rewrite relations can be order relations as well as equivalence
    relations. If they are order relations, appropriate monotonicity
    lemmas are selected.
    
    These proof tools were heavily used throughout the work on
    computational algebra. Many examples are given that illustrate their
    operation and demonstrate their effectiveness.
    
    The foundation for algebra introduced classes of monoids, groups, ring
    and modules, and included theories of order relations and
    permutations.  Work on finite sets and multisets illustrates how a
    quotienting operation hides details of datatypes when reasoning about
    functional programs. Theories of summation operators were developed
    that drew indices from integer ranges, lists and multisets, and that
    summed over all the classes mentioned above. Elementary factorization
    theory was developed that characterized when cancellation monoids are
    factorial. An abstract data type for the operations of multivariate
    polynomial arithmetic was defined and the correctness of an
    implementation of these operations was verified. The implementation is
    similar to those found in current computer algebra systems.
    
    This work was all done in Nuprl's constructive type theory. The thesis
    discusses the appropriateness of this foundation, and the extent to
    which the work relied on it.",

    In the world of proof assistants these two kinds of natural deduction

    "We present a semantics of a significant fragment of the C programming
    language as described by the C11 standard. It consists of a small step
    semantics of a core language, which uses a structured memory model to
    capture subtleties of C11, such as strict-aliasing restrictions
    related to unions, that have not yet been addressed by others. The
    semantics of actual C programs is defined by translation into this
    core language. We have an explicit type system for the core language,
    and prove type preservation and progress, as well as type correctness
    of the translation.
    
    Due to unspecified order of evaluation, our operational semantics is
    non-deterministic. To explore all defined and undefined behaviors, we
    present an executable semantics that computes a stream of finite sets
    of reachable states. It is proved sound and complete with respect to
    the operational semantics.
    
    Both the translation into the core language and the executable
    semantics are defined as Coq programs.  Extraction to OCaml is used to
    obtain a C interpreter to run and test the semantics on actual C

    intermediate step.

    The first step in the method presented in this paper is to transform a
    mathematical specification into a Haskell program. The next step is to
    make repetition structures explicit by higher order functions, and
    after that rewrite the specification in the form of a Mealy
    Machine. Finally, adaptations have to be made in order to comply to
    the fixed nature of hardware. The result is then given to
    C$\lambda$aSH, a compiler which generates synthesizable VHDL from the
    resulting Haskell code. An advantage of the approach presented here is
    that in all phases of the process the design can be directly simulated
    by executing the defining code in a standard Haskell environment.

    To illustrate the design process, the N queens problem is chosen as a
    running example."

    In this paper it is shown how it is possible to
    automate these tasks by integrating a first-order automated theorem
    proving tool, called FAUST, into HOL.  It is based on an efficient
    variant of the well-known sequent calculus.  In order to maintain the
    high confdence in HOL-generated proofs, FAUST is able to generate HOL

    results on polynomials over some rational function field by
    computations that are done merely over the rationals and, therefore,
    is of general interest also. Finally, computing time statistics on 70

    "{\sl Mathematical Components} is the name of a library of formalized
    mathematic for the COQ system. It covers a veriety of topics, from the
    theory of basic data structures (e.g. numbers, lists, finite sets) to
    advanced results in various flavors of algebra. This library
    constitutes the infrastructure for the machine-checked proofs of the
    Four Color Theorem and the Odd Order Theorem.

    The reason of existence of this books is to break down the barriers to
    entry. While there are several books around covering the usage of the
    COQ system and the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components
    library is build in an unconventional way. As a consequence, this book
    provides a non-standard presentation of COQ, putting upfront the
    formalization choices and the proof style that are the pillars of the
    library.

    This book targets two classes of public. On one hand, newcomers, even
    the more mathematically inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the
    programming language of COQ, Gallina, and the Ssreflect proof
    language.  On the other hand accustomed COQ users find a substantial
    accound of the formalization style that made the Mathematical
    Components library possible.

    By no means does this book pretend to be a complete description of COQ
    or Ssreflect: both tools already come with a comprehensive user
    manual.  In the course of the book, the reader is nevertheless invited
    to experiment with a large library of formalized concepts and she is
    given as soon as possible sufficient tools to prove non-trivial
    mathematical results by reusing parts of the library. By the end of
    the first part, the reader has learnt how to prove formally the
    infinitude of prime numbers, or the correctnes of the Euclidean's
    division algorithm, in a few lines of proof text.",

    and tools can be applied to check for errors in the design, even while
    it is being written. In contrast, conventional design documents
    consist of prose, static diagrams, and perhaps pseudo-code in an ad

    are often ambiguous, or omit critical aspects such as partial failure
    or the granularity of concurrency (i.e. which constructs are assumed
    to be atomic). At the other end of the spectrum, the final executable
    code is unambiguous, but contains an overwhelming amount of detail. We
    needed to be able to capture the essence of a design in a few hundred
    lines of precise description. As our designs are unavoidably complex,
    we need a highly-expressive language, far above the level of code, but
    with precise semantics. That expressivity must cover real-world
    concurrency and fault-tolerance. And, as we wish to build services

  abstract =
    "We present a new approach to automated reasoning about higher-order
    programs by endowing symbolic execution with a notion of higher-order,
    symbolic values.

    To validate our approach, we use it to develop and evaluate a system
    for verifying and refuting behavioral software contracts of components
    in a functional language, which we call {\sl soft contract
    verification}. In doing so, we discover a mutually beneficial relation
    between behavioral contracts and higher-order symbolic
    execution. Contracts aid symbolic execution by providing a rich
    language of specifications that can serve as the basis of symbolic
    higher-order values; the theory of blame enables modular verification
    and leads to the theorem that {\sl verified compnents can't be
    blamed}; and the run-time monitoring of contracts enables {\sl soft}
    verification whereby verified and unverified components can safely
    interact and verification is not an all-or-nothing
    proposition. Conversely, symbolic execution aids contracts by
    providing compile-time verification which increases assurance and
    enables optimizations; automated test-case generation for contracts
    with counter-examples; and engendering a virtuous cycle between
    verification and the gradual spread of contracts.

    Our system uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging contracts
    as a source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values,
    and employs an updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about
    flow-sensitive facts. Whenever a contract is refuted, it reports a
    concrete {\sl counterexample} reproducing the error, which may involve
    solving for an unknown function. The approach is able to analyze
    first-class contracts, recursive data structures, unknown functions,
    and control-flow-sensitive refinement of values, which are all
    idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of an
    off-the-shelf solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. Our
    counterexample search is sound and relatively complete with respect to
    a first-order solver for base type values. Therefore, it can form the
    basis of automated verification and bug-finding tools for higher-order
    programs. The approach is competitive with a wide range of existing
    tools -- including type systems, flow analyzers, and model checkers --
    on their own benchmarks. We have built a tool which analyzes programs

    "Recently my research has been centered around the development of a
    self-certifying compiler for a functional language with linear types
    called Cogent (see O'Connor et al. [2016]). The compiler works by
    emitting, along with generated low-level code, a proof in Isabelle/HOL
    (see Nipkow et al. [2002]) that the generated code is a refinement of
    the original program, expressed via a simple functional semantics in HOL.

    As dependent types unify for us the language of code and proof, my
    current endeavour has been to explore how such a compiler would look
    if it were implemented and verified in a dependently typed programming
    language instead. In this post, I implement and verify a toy compiler
    for a language of arithmetic expressions and variables to an idealised
    assembly language for a virtual stack machine, and explain some of the
    useful features that dependent types give us for writing verified
    compilers."

    "Recent discoveries have been made connecting abstract homotopy
    theory and the field of type theory from logic and theoretical computer
    science. This has given rise to a new field, which has been christened
    {\sl homotopy type theory}. In this direction, Vladimir Voevodsky 
    observed that it is possible to model type theory using simpical sets
    and that this model satisfies an additional property, called the
    {\sl Univalence Axiom}, which has a number of striking consequences.
    He has subsequently advocated a program, which he calls {\sl univalent
    foundations}, of developing mathematics in the setting of type theory
    with the Univalence Axiom and possibly other additional axioms motivated
    by the simplical set model. Because type theory posses good computational
    properties, this program can be carried out in a computer proof assistant.
    In this paper we give an introduction to homotopy type theory in 
    Voevodsky's setting, paying attention to both theoretical and practical
    issues. In particular, the paper serves as an introduction to both the
    general ideas of homotopy type theory as well as to some of the concrete
    details of Voevodsky's work using the well-known proof assistant Coq. 
    The paper is written for a general audience of mathematicians with basic
    knowledge of algebraic topology; the paper does not assume any 
    preliminary knowledge of type theory, logic, or computer science. Because
    a defining characteristic of Voevodsky's program is that the Coq code has
    fundamental mathematical content, and many of the mathematical concepts
    which are efficiently captured in the code cannot be explained in 
    standard mathematical English without a length detour through type theory,
    the later sections of this paper (beginning with Section 3) make use of
    code; however, all notions are introduced from the beginning and in a
    self-contained fashion.",

    "This paper describes a program called BOUNDER that proves

    Previous inequality algorithms perform well on some subset of the

    BOUNDER maintains a hierarchy of increasingly complex algorithms.
    When one fails to resolve an inequality, it tries the next.  This
    strategy resolves more inequalities than any single algorithm.  It
    also performs well on hard problems without wasting time on easy
    ones.  The current hierarchy consists of four algorithms: bounds
    propagation, substitution, derivative inspection, and iterative
    approximation.  Propagation is an extension of interval arithmetic
    that takes linear time, but ignores constraints between variables
    and multiple occurrences of variables.  The remaining algorithms
    consider these factors, but require exponential time.  Substitution
    is a new, provably correct, algorithm for utilizing constraints
    between variables.  The final two algorithms analyze constraints
    between variables.  Inspection examines the signs of partial
    derivatives.  Iteration is based on several earlier algorithms

    "Although generic programming founds more and more attention –
    nowadays generic programming languages as well as generic libraries
    exist – there are hardly approaches for the verification of generic
    algorithms or generic libraries. This thesis deals with generic
    algorithms in the field of computer algebra. We propose the Mizar
    system as a theorem prover capable of verifying generic algorithms on
    an appropriate abstract level. The main advantage of the MIZAR theorem
    prover is its special input language that enables textbook style
    presentation of proofs. For generic versions of Brown/Henrici addition
    and of Euclidean’s algorithm we give complete correctness proofs
    written in the MIZAR language.
    
    Moreover, we do not only prove algorithms correct in the usual
    sense. In addition we show how to check, using the MIZAR system, that
    a generic algebraic algorithm is correctly instantiated with a
    particular domain. Answering this question that especially arises if
    one wants to implement generic programming languages, in the field of
    computer algebra requires nontrivial mathematical knowledge.
    
    To build a verification system using the MIZAR theorem prover, we also
    implemented a generator which almost automatically computes for a
    given algorithm a set of theorems that imply the correctness of this

    theorem proving system CLAM. 

    One surprising discovery was the
    usefulness of the ripple tactic in summing series. Rippling is the key
    tactic for controlling inductive proofs, and was previously thought to
    be specialised to such proofs. However, it turns out to be the key
    sub-tactic used by all the main tactics for summing series. The only
    change required was that it had to be supplemented by a difference
    matching algorithm to set up some initial meta-level annotations to
    guide the rippling process. In inductive proofs these annotations are
    provided by the application of mathematical induction. This evidence
    suggests that rippling, supplemented by difference matching, will find
    wide application in controlling mathematical proofs. The research
    reported in this paper was supported by SERC grant GR/F/71799, a SERC
    PostDoctoral Fellowship to the first author and a SERC Senior
    Fellowship to the third author. We would like to thank the other
    members of the mathematical reasoning group for their feedback on this

    allows dilogarithms to occur in the integral in addition to elementary
    functions. The proof is base on two identities for the dilogarithm,
    that characterize all the possible algebraic relations among
    dilogarithms of functions that are built up from the rational
    functions by taking transcendental exponentials, dilogarithms, and
    logarithms.",

    is based on a series of analyses rendered by Carlson and his
    associates in the last ten years (Refs. 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12). The class
    of integrands is of the form $r(x,y)$, where $y^2$ is a polynomial in $x$,
    and $r$ a rational function in $x$ and $y$. This is the type of integrand
    that classically led to the study of elliptic integrals. At first
    glance this is a rather restricted class of algebraic functions. But
    in fact many trigonometric and hyperbolic integrands reduce to this
    form. The richness of this class of integrands is exemplified by a
    recently published handbook of 3000 integral formulas (Ref. 1). Our
    proposed approach will cover fifty to seventy percent of the items in
    the handbook. Furthermore the non-classical approach we shall describe
    holds great promise of developing to the case where definite integrals
    can be evaluated in terms of a host of other well-known functions

    "In 1976 Risch [1] proposed a scheme for finding the integrals of
    forms built up out of transcendental functions that viewed general
    functions as rational forms in a suitable differential field and
    represented the polynomial parts of those forms in a distributed
    rather than recursive way. By using a data representation where all
    variables were (more or less) equally important this new method seemed
    to side-step some of the complications that had appeared in his
    previous scheme [2] where various side-constraints had to be
    propagated between the levels present in a tower of separate
    extensions of differential fields, otherwise seen as levels in
    recursive data structures. 

    An initial implementation of the method was
    prepared in the context of the SCRATCHPAD/1 algebra system and
    demonstrated at the 1976 SYMSAC meeting at Yorktown Heights, a
    subsequent version for Reduce [3][5] came after that, and made it
    possible to try the method on a large range of integrals. These
    practical studies showed up some problems with the method and its
    implementation. 

    The presentation given here re-expresses the 1976
    Risch method in terms of rewrite rules, and thus exposes the major
    problem it suffers from as a manifestation of the fact that in certain
    circumstances the set of rewrites generated is not confluent. This
    difficulty is then attacked using a critical-pair/completion (CPC)
    approach. For very many integrands it is then easy to see that the
    initial set of rewrites used in the early implementations [1] and [3]
    do not need any extension, and this fact explains the high level of
    competence of the programs involved despite their shaky theoretical
    foundations. For a further large collection of problems even a simple
    CPC scheme converges rapidly; when the techniques presented here are
    applied to the REDUCE integration test suite in all applicable cases a
    short computation succeeds in completing the set of rewrites and hence
    gives a secure basis for testing for integrability. 

    This paper describes the implementation of the CPC process and
    discusses current limitations to and possible future extended
    applications of it.",

  abstract = "
    The general goal of this thesis is to investigate and develop computer
    algebra tools for the simplification resp. evaluation of definite
    integrals. One way of finding the value of a definite integral is
    via the evaluation of an antiderivative of the integrand. In the
    nineteenth century Joseph Liouville was among the first who analyzed
    the structure of elementary antiderivatives of elementary functions
    systematically. In the early twentieth century the algebraic structure
    of differential fields was introduced for modeling the differential
    properties of functions. Using this framework Robert H. Risch
    published a complete algorithm for transcendental elementary
    integrands in 1969. Since then this result has been extended to
    certain other classes of integrands as well by Michael F. Singer,
    Manuel Bronstein, and several others. On the other hand, if no
    antiderivative of suitable form is available, then linear relations
    that are satisfied by the parameter integral of interest may be found
    based on the principle of parametric integration (often called
    differentiating under the integral sign or creative telescoping).

    The main result of this thesis extends the results mentioned above to
    a complete algorithm for parametric elementary integration for a
    certain class of integrands covering a majority of the special
    functions appearing in practice such as orthogonal polynomials,
    polylogarithms, Bessel functions, etc. A general framework is provided
    to model those functions in terms of suitable differential fields. If
    the integrand is Liouvillian, then the present algorithm considerably
    improves the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm given by Singer
    et al. in 1985. Additionally, a generalization of Czichowski’s
    algorithm for computing the logarithmic part of the integral is
    presented. Moreover, also partial generalizations to include other
    types of integrands are treated.

    As subproblems of the integration algorithm one also has to find
    solutions of linear ordinary differential equations of a certain
    type. Some contributions are also made to solve those problems in our
    setting, where the results directly dealing with systems of
    differential equations have been joint work with Moulay A. Barkatou.

    For the case of Liouvillian integrands we implemented the algorithm in
    form of our Mathematica package Integrator. Parts of the
    implementation also deal with more general functions. Our procedures
    can be applied to a significant amount of the entries in integral
    tables, both indefinite and definite integrals. In addition, our
    procedures have been successfully applied to interesting examples of
    integrals that do not appear in these tables or for which current
    standard computer algebra systems like Mathematica or Maple do not
    succeed. We also give examples of how parameter integrals coming from
    the work of other researchers can be solved with the software, e.g.,
    an integral arising in analyzing the entropy of certain processes.",

    Computing integrals is a common task in many areas of science,
    antiderivatives are one way to accomplish this.  The problem of
    integration in finite terms can be states as follows. Given a
    differential field $(F,D)$ and $f \in F$, compute $g$ in some
    elementary extension of $(F,D)$ such that $Dg = f$ if such a $g$
    exists.

    This problem has been solved for various classes of fields $F$.  For
    rational functions $(C(x), \frac{d}{dx})$ such a $g$ always exists and
    algorithms to compute it are known already for a long time. In 1969
    Risch published an algorithm that solves this problem when $(F,D)$ is
    a transcendental elementary extension of $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Later
    this has been extended towards integrands being Liouvillian functions
    by Singer et. al. via the use of regular log-explicit extensions of
    $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Our algorithm extends this to handling
    transcendental Liouvillian extensions $(F,D)$ of $(C,0)$ directly
    without the need to embed them into log-explicit extensions. For
    example, this means that
    \[\int{(z-x)x^{z-1}e^{-x}dx} = x^ze^{-x}\]
    can be computed without including log(x) in the differential field.",

    $\int{f}$ of a given function $f$ as a finite combination $g$ of elementary

    functions contains an element $g$ such that $g^\prime = f$.

    In the first part of this thesis, we compare different algorithms for
    symbolic integration. Specifically, we review the integration rules
    taught in calculus courses and how they can be used systematically to
    create a reasonable, but somewhat limited, integration method. Then we
    present the differential algebra required to prove the transcendental
    cases of Risch's algorithm. Risch's algorithm decides if the integral
    of an elementary function is elementary and if so computes it. The
    presentation is mostly self-contained and, we hope, simpler than
    previous descriptions of the algorithm. Finally, we describe
    Risch-Norman's algorithm which, although it is not a decision
    procedure, works well in practice and is considerably simpler than the
    full Risch algorithm.

    In the second part of this thesis, we briefly discuss an
    implementation of a computer algebra system and some of the

    the rule-based approach and how it can be used, not only to compute

    "Algorithms on multivariate polynomials represented by straight-line
    programs are developed.  First, it is shown that most algebraic
    algorithms can be probabilistically applied to data that are given by
    a straight-line computation.  Testing such rational numeric data for
    zero, for instance, is facilitated by random evaluations modulo random
    prime numbers.  Then, auxiliary algorithms that determine the
    coefficients of a multivariate polynomial in a single variable are
    constructed.  The first main result is an algorithm that produces the
    greatest common divisor of the input polynomials, all in straight-line
    representation.  The second result shows how to find a straight-line
    program for the reduced numerator and denominator from one for the
    corresponding rational function.  Both the algorithm for that
    construction and the greatest common divisor algorithm are in random
    polynomial time for the usual coefftcient fields and output a
    straight-line program, which with controllably high probability
    correctly determines the requested answer.  The running times are
    polynomial functions in the binary input size, the input degrees as
    unary numbers, and the logarithm of the inverse of the failure
    probability.  The algorithm for straight-line programs for the
    numerators and denominators of rational functions implies that every
    degree-bounded rational function can be computed fast in parallel,
    that is, in polynomial size and polylogarithmic depth.",

    "In this thesis we address algorithms for polynomial factorisation
    over finite fields. In the univariate case, we study a recent
    algorithm due to Niederreiter where the factorisation problem is
    reduced to solving a linear system over the finite field in question,
    and the solutions are used to produce the complete factorisation of
    the polynomials into irreducibles. We develop a new algorithm for
    solving the linear system using sparse Gaussian elimination with the
    Markowitz ordering strategy, and conjecture that the Niederreiter
    linear system is not only initially sparse, but also preserves its
    sparsity throughout the Gaussian elimination phase. We develop a new
    bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) algorithm base on the approach of
    Gottfert for extracting the factors of a polynomial using a basis of
    the Niederreiter solution set of $\mathbb{F}_2$. We improve upon the
    complexity and performance of the original algorithm, and produce
    binary univariate factorisations of trinomials up to degree 400000.

    We present a new approach to multivariate polynomial factorisation
    which incorporates ideas from polyhedral geometry, and generalises
    Hensel lifting. The contribution is an algorithm for factoring
    bivariate polynomials via polytopes which is able to exploit to some
    extent the sparsity of polynomials. We further show that the polytope
    method can be made sensitive to the number of nonzero terms of the
    input polynomial. We describe a sparse adaptation of the polytope
    method over finite fields of prime order which requires fewer bit
    operations and memory references for polynomials which are known to be
    the product of two sparse factors. Using this method, and to the best
    of our knowledge, we achieve a world record in binary bivariate
    factorisation of a sparse polynomial of degree 20000. We develop a BSP
    variant of the absolute irreducibility testing via polytopes given in
    [45], producing a more memory and run time efficient method that can
    provide wider ranges of applicability. We achieve absolute
    irreducibility testing of a bivariate and trivariate polynomial of
    degree 30000, and of multivariate polynomials with up to 3000

    In [14] an algorithm was presented for zero-testing functions defined

    In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
    ``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
    On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
    programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
    paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between the two,
    which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmetic implement
    the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise because
    mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex numbers, is
    more difficult than expected; for example the complex function log is
    not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse function
    is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic
    simplification rules are not universally valid.

    The good news is that these problems are theoretically capable of
    being solved, and are practically close to being solved, but not yet
    solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is still a long
    way to go before implementations match the theoretical possibilities.",

    resolved between the various algebra systems and the numerical

    systems, many mathematical textbooks are much further behind: for

    In this paper we present a new deterministic algorithm for computing
    the square-free decomposition of multivariate polynomials with
    coefficients from a finite field.

    Our algorithm is based on Yun's square-free factorization algorithm
    for characteristic 0. The new algorithm is more efficient than
    existing, deterministic algorithms based on Musser's squarefree
    algorithm

    We will show that the modular approach presented by Yun has no
    significant performance advantage over our algorithm. The new
    algorithm is also simpler to implement and it can rely on any existing
    GCD algorithm without having to worry about choosing ``good'' evaluation
    points.

    To demonstrate this, we present some timings using implementations in
    Maple (Char et al. 1991), where the new algorithm is used for Release
    4 onwards, and Axiom (Jenks and Sutor, 1992) which is the only system
    known to the author to use and implementation of Yun's modular
    algorithm mentioned above.",

    The concept of polynomial squarefree decomposition is an important one
    in algebraic computation. The squarefree decomposition process has
    many uses in computer symbolic computation. A recent survey by D. Yun
    [3] describes many useful algorithms for this purpose. All of these
    methods depend on computing the greated common divisor (gcd) of the
    polynomial to be decomposed and its first derivative (with repect to
    some variable). In the multivariate case, this gcd computation is
    non-trivial and dominates the cost for the squarefree decompostion.",

    Previously known algorithms for polynomial square-free decomposition
    rely on greatest common divisor (gcd) computations over the same
    coefficient domain where the decomposition is to be performed. In
    particular, gcd of the given polynomial and its first derivative (with
    respect to some variable) is obtained to begin with. Application of
    modular homomorphism and $p$-adic construction (multivariate case) or
    the Chinese remainder algorithm (univariate case) results in new
    square-free decomposition algorithms which, generally speaking, take
    less time than a single gcd between the given polynomial and its first
    derivative. The key idea is to obtain one or several ``correct''
    homomorphic images of the desired square-free decomposition
    first. This provides information as to how many different square-free
    factors there are, their multiplicities and their homomorphic
    images. Since the multiplicities are known, only the square-free
    factors need to be constructed. Thus, these new algorithms are

    The summation analogue of the Risch integration algorithm developed by
    Karr uses towers of difference fields to model nested indefinite sums

    fields to model the so called {\sl elementary functions}. The

    equations over such towers of difference fields, in turn simplifying

    "The main result of this thesis is an effective method to extend Karr's
    symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for
    example, when working with expressions involving $(-1)^n$. An
    implementation of this method, including a modernised version of
    Karr's algorithm is presented.

    Karr's algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for
    indefinite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized
    difference fields called $\prod\sum$-fields are used to model nested
    sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions
    involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in
    differential fields in the integration case.

    In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental
    extensions are allowed in Karr's construction. Algebraic extensions of
    $\prod\sum$-fields can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr's
    methods rely heavily on the ability to solve first-order linear
    difference equations and they are no longer applicable over these
    rings.

    Based on Bronstein's formulation of a method used by Singer for the
    solution of differential equations over algebraic extensions, we
    transform a first-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to
    a system of first-order equations over a purely transcendental
    extension field. However, this domain is not necessarily a
    $\prod\sum$-field. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der
    Put, we reduce this system to a single first-order equation over a
    $\prod\sum$-field, which can be solved by Karr's algorithm. We also
    describe how to construct towers of difference ring extensions on an
    algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used.

    A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the
    computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function
    fields. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over $\mathbb{Q}(x)$
    which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS
    subroutines after modular reduction. This part is joint work with Arne
    Storjohann.",

    We seek to understand a general method for finding a closed form for a
    given sum that acts as its antidifference in the same way that an
    integral has an antiderivative. Once an antidifference is found, then
    given the limits of the sum, it suffices to evaluate the
    antidifference at the given limits. Several algorithms (by Karr and
    Schneider) exist to find antidifferences, but the apers describing
    these algorithms leave out several of the key proofs needed to
    implement the algorithms. We attempt to fill in these gaps and find
    that many of the steps to solve difference equations rely on being
    able to solve two problems: the equivalence problem and the homogenous
    group membership problem. Solving these two problems is essential to
    finding the polynomial degree bounds and denominator bounds for
    solutions of difference equations. We study Karr and Schneider's

    One of the problems with manipulating function identities in computer
    algebra systems is that they often involve functions which are
    multivalued, whilst most users tend to work with single-valued
    functions.  The problem is that many well-known identities may no
    longer be true everywhere in the complex plane when working with their
    single-valued counterparts. Conversely, we cannot ignore them, since
    in particular contexts they may be valid. We investigate the
    practicality of a method to verify such identities by means of an
    experiment; this is based on a set of test examples which one might
    realistically meet in practice.  Essentially, the method works as
    follows. We decompose the complex plane via means of cylindrical
    algebraic decomposition into regions with respect to the branch cuts
    of the functions. We then test the identity numerically at a sample
    point in the region. The latter step is facilitated by the notion of
    the {\sl adherence} of a branch cut, which was previously introduced
    by the authors. In addition to presenting the results of the
    experiment, we explain how adherence relates to the proposal of 
    {\sl signed zeros} by W. Kahan, and develop this idea further in order to
    allow us to cover previously untreatable cases. Finally, we discuss
    other ways to improve upon our general methodology as well as topics

    An optimal solution formula construction algorithm would be {\sl

    "The McCallum Projection for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD)

    however it does not always produce a sign-invariant CAD for the set of

    factor vanishes identically over a k-level cell. According to
    McCallum's paper, when this happens (and $k+1$ is not the highest
    level in the CAD) we do not know whether the projection is valid,
    i.e. whether or not a sign-invariant CAD for the set of input
    polynomials will be produced when lifting is performed in the usual
    way. When the $k$-level cell in question has dimension 0, McCallum
    suggests a modification of the lifting method that will ensure the
    validity of his projection, although to my knowledge this has never
    been implemented.

    In this paper we give easily computable criteria that often allow us
    to conclude that McCallum's projection is valid even though a
    projection factor vanishes identically over a cell. We also improve on
    McCallum's modified lifting method.

    We've incorporated the ideas contained in the paper into QEPCAD, the
    most complete implementation of CAD. When McCallum's projection is
    invalid because of a projection factor not being order-invariant over a
    region on which it vanishes identically, at least a warning message
    ought to be issued. Currently, QEPCAD may print warning messages that
    are not needed, and may fail to print warning messages when they are
    needed. Our implementation in QEPCAD ensures that warning messages are
    printed when needed, and reduces the number of times warning messages
    are printed when not needed. Neither McCallum's modified lifting
    method nor our improvement of it have been implemented in QEPCAD. The

    determination algorithm due to Ben-Or, Kozen and Reif. In this
    paper we describe a new sign determination method based on the earlier
    algorithm, but with two advantages: (i) It is faster in the univariate
    case, and (ii) In the general case, it allows purely symbolic
    quantifier elimination in pseudo-polynomial time. By purely symbolic,
    we mean that it is possible to eliminate a quantified variable from a
    system of polynomials no matter what the coefficient values are. The
    previous methods required the coefficients to be themselves
    polynomials in other variables. Our new method allows transcendental
    functions or derivatives to appear in the coefficients.
    
    Another corollary of the new sign-determination algorithm is a very
    simple, practical algorithm for deciding existentially-quantified
    formulae of the theory of the reals. We present an algorithm that has
    a bit complexity of $n^{k+1}d^{O(k)}(c log n)^{1+\epsilon}$ randomized, or

    elimination method for this theory also provides a decision method,
    which enables one to decide whether any sentence of the theory is
    true or false.  Since many important and difficult mathematical
    problems can be expressed in this theory, any computationally
    feasible quantifier elimination algorithm would be of utmost
    significance.  
    
    However, it became apparent that Tarski's method required too much
    computation to be practical except for quite trivial problems.
    Seidenberg in 1954, described another method which he thought
    would be more efficient.  A third method was published by Cohen in
    1969.  Some significant improvements of Tarski's method have been
    made by W. Boge, which are described in a thesis by Holthusen

    University in March 1973 and in abstract form at a symposium at 
    Carnegie-Mellon University in May 1973.  In August 1974 a full 
    presentation of the method was delivered at the EUROSAM 74 Conference 
    in Stockholm, and a preliminary version of the present paper was 
    published in the proceedings of that conference.",

    intermingles CAD construction with truth evaluation so that parts of
    the CAD are constructed only as needed to further truth evaluation and
    aborts CAD construction as soon as no more truth evaluation is needed.
    The truth evaluation utilizes in an essential way any quantifiers

    from which some variables are absent.  Preliminary observations show

    In $\S{}I$ we give a generalisation of Sturm theorem essentially due to

    Our result is an improvement of previously known results (see [BKR])
    since no hypotheses have to be made on polynomials.

    In $\S{}III$ we introduce the Sturm-Habicht sequence, which generalises
    Habicht's work ([H]). This new sequence obtained automatically from a
    subresultant sequence has some remarkable properties:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item it gives the same information than the Sturm sequence, and this

    "Many important mathematical and applied mathematical problems can be
    formulated as quantifier elimination problems (QE) in elementary
    algebra and geometry. Among several proposed QE methods, the best one
    is the CAD-based method due to G. E. Collins. The major contributions
    of this thesis are centered around improving each phase of the
    CAD-based method: the projection phase, the truth-invariant CAD
    construction phase, and the solution formula construction phase
    
    Improvements in the projection phase. By generalizing a lemma on which
    the proof of the original projection operation is based, we are able
    to reduce the size of the projection set significantly, and thus speed
    up the whole QE process.
    
    Improvements in the truth-invariant CAD construction phase. By
    intermingling the stack constructions with the truth evaluations, we
    are usually able to complete quantifier elimination with only a
    partially built CAD, resulting in significant speedup.
    
    Improvements in the solution formula construction phase. By
    constructing defining formulas for a collection of cells instead of
    individual cells, we are often able to produce simple solution
    formulas, without incurring the enormous cost of augmented projection.
    
    The new CAD-based QE algorithm, which integrates all the improvements
    above, has been implemented and tested on ten QE problems from diverse
    application areas. The overall speedups range from 2 to perhaps
    300,000 times at least
    
    We also implemented D. Lazard's recent improvement on the projection
    phase. Tests on the ten QE problems show additional speedups by up to
    1.8 times."

    An algorithm is given for eliminating the quantifier from a formula
    $(\exists x \in \mathbb{R})[a_x^2+a_1x+a_0=0 \land F]$, where $F$
    is a quantifier free formula in $x_1,\ldots,x_r,x$ and
    $a_2,a_1,a_0$ are polynomials in $x_1,\ldots,x_r$ with real
    coefficients such that the system 
    $\{a_2=0,a_1=0,a_0=0\}$ has no solution in $\mathbb{R}^r$.
    The output formulas are made of resultants and their variants,
    which we call {\sl slope} resultants. The slope resultants can be,
    like the resultants, expressed as determinants of certain matrices.
    If we allow the determinant symbol in the output the computing time
    of the algorithm is {\sl linear} in the length of the input. If not,
    the computing time is dominated by $N(n^{2r+1}\ell+n^{2r}\ell^2)$
    where $N$ is the number of polynomials in the input formula, $r$
    is the number of variables, $n$ is the maximum of the degrees for
    every variable, and $\ell$ is the maximum of the integer 
    coefficient bit lengths. Experimants with implementation suggest
    that the algorithm is sufficiently efficient to be useful in practice.",

    equivalent to the input. The motivation/rationale for studying such a
    variant QE problem is that many quantified formulas arising in
    applications do satisfy the extra conditions. Furthermore, in most
    applications, it is sufficient that the output formula is almost
    equivalent to the input formula. The main idea underlying the
    algorithm is to substitute the repeated projection step of CAD by a
    single projection without carrying out a parametric existential
    decision over the reals. We find that the algorithm can tackle
    important and challenging problems, such as numerical stability
    analysis of the widely-used MacCormack’s scheme. The problem has been
    practically out of reach for standard QE algorithms in spite of many
    attempts to tackle it. However, the current implementation of VQE can
    solve it in about 12 hours. This paper extends the results reported at

    "A fundamental algorithm pertaining to the solution of polynomial

    a set $A$ of integral polynomials in $r$ variables, the cad 
    algorithm produces a decomposition of the euclidean space of $r$
    dimensions into cells, such that each polynomial in $A$ is 
    invariant in sign throughout each of the cells in the decomposition.
    
    A key component of the cad algorithm is the projection operation:
    the {\sl projection} of a set $A$ of $r$-variate polynomials is
    defined to be a certain set $P$ of $(r-1)$-variate polynomials.
    The solution set, or variety, of the polynomials in $P$ comprises
    a projection in the geometric sense of the variety of $A$. The cad
    algorithm proceeds by forming successive projections of the input
    set $A$, each projection resulting in the elimination of one
    variable.
    
    This thesis is concerned with a refinement to the cad algorithm,
    and to its projection operation in particular. It is shown, using
    a theorem from real algebraic geometry, that the original 
    projection set that Collins used can be substantially reduced in
    size, without affecting its essential properties. The results of
    theoretical analysis and empirical observations suggest that the

    by the algebraic constraints and defined in terms of the trace from
    the coordinate ring of the variety to the ground field, and we show
    that the rank and signature of these forms are sufficient to determine
    the number of real points lying within a constraint region. In all
    cases we count geometric points, which is to say, we count points
    without multiplicity. The theoretical results on these quadratic forms
    are more or less classical, but forgotten too, and can be found also

    We insist on effectivity of the computation and complexity analysis:
    we show how to calculate the trace and signature using Gröbner bases,

    forms may be combined to determine the number of real points
    satisfying a conjunction of constraints. The complexity of the

    "A. Tarski [4] has given a decision method for elementary algebra. In
     essence this comes to giving an algorithm for deciding whether a
     given finite set of polynomial inequalities has a solution. Below we
     offer another proof of this result of Tarski. The main point of our
     proof is accomplished upon showing how to decide whether a given
     polynomial $f(x,y)$ in two variables, defined over the field 
     $\mathbb{R}$ 
     of rational numbers, has a zero in a real-closed field $\mathbb{K}$ 
     containing $R^1$.
     This is done in \S{}2, but for purposes of induction it is necessary to
     consider also the case that the coefficients of $f(x,y)$ involve
     parameters; the remarks in \S{}3 will be found sufficient for this
     point. In \S{}1, the problem is reduced to a decision for equalities,
     but an induction (on the number of unknowns) could not possibly be
     carried out on equalities alone; we consider a simultaneous system
     consisting of one equality $f(x,y) = 0$ and one inequality $F(x) \ne 0$.
     Once the decision for this case is achieved, at least as in \S{}3,
     the induction is immediate.",

    "We consider linear problems in fields, ordered fields, discretely
    valued fields (with finite residue field or residue field of
    characteristic zero) and fields with finitely many independent
    orderings and discrete valuations. Most of the fields considered will
    be of characteristic zero. Formally, linear statements about these
    structures (with parameters) are given by formulas of the respective
    first-order language, in which all bound variables occur only
    linearly. We study symbolic algorithms 
    ({\sl linear elimination procedures})
    that reduce linear formulas to linear formulas of a very simple form,
    i.e. quantifier-free linear formulas, and algorithms 
    ({\sl linear decision procedures}) 
    that decide whether a given linear sentence holds in all
    structures of the given class. For all classes of fields considered,
    we find linear elimination procedures that run in double exponential
    space and time. As a consequence, we can show that for fields (with
    one or several discrete valuations), linear statements can be
    transferred from characteristic zero to prime characteristic $p$,
    provided $p$ is double exponential in the length of the statement. (For
    similar bounds in the non-linear case, see Brown, 1978.) We find
    corresponding linear decision procedures in the Berman complexity
    classes $\bigcup_{c\in N} STA(*,2^{cn},dn)$
    for $d = 1, 2$. In particular, all these procedures run in
    exponential space. The technique employed is quantifier elimination
    via Skolem terms based on Ferrante and Rackoff (1975). Using ideas of
    Fischer and Rabin (1974), Berman (1977), Fürer (1982), we establish
    lower bounds for these problems showing that our upper bounds are
    essentially tight. For linear formulas with a bounded number of
    quantifiers all our algorithms run in polynomial time. For linear
    formulas of bounded quantifier alternation most of the algorithms run
    in time $2^{O(n^k)}$ for fixed $k$.",

    numbers is a facinating area of research at the intersection of

    computer algebra, computational geometry and complexity
    theory. Originally the method of quantifier elimination was invented
    (among others by Th. Skolem) in mathematical logic as a technical tool
    for solving the decision problem for a formalized mathematical
    theory. For the elementary formal theory of real numbers (or more
    accurately of real closed fields) such a quantifier elimination
    procedure was established in the 1930s by A. Tarski, using an
    extension of Sturm's theorem of the 1830s for counting the number of
    real zeros of a univariate polynomial in a given interval. Since then
    an abundance of new decision and quantifier elimination methods for
    this theory with variations and optimizations has been published with
    the aim both of establishing the theoretical complexity of the problem
    and of finding methods that are of practical importance (see Arnon
    1988a and the discussion and references in Renegar 1992a, 1992b, 1992c
    for a comparison of these methods). For subproblems such as
    elimination of quantifiers with respect to variables, that are

    "For numerical experiments concerning various problems in a finite
    field $\mathbb{F}_q$ it is useful to have an explicit data
    presentation $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ of for large $m$, and a method for the
    construction of towers
    \[\mathbb{F}_q \subset \mathbb{F}_{q^{d_1}} \subset \cdots \subset
    \mathbb{F}_{q^{d_k}} = \mathbb{F}_{q^m}\]
    In order to avoid the identification problem it is advantageous to 
    have all fields in the tower presented by properly chosen normal bases, 
    whereby the embedding 
    $\mathbb{F}_{q^{d_i}} \subset \mathbb{F}_{q^{d_{i+1}}}$
    is given by the trace function.
    
    The following notion is introduced: A sequence of polynomials 
    $\{f_n | n \ge 1\}$ with degree$(f_n)=n$ called trace-compatible over 
    $\mathbb{F}_q$ if (1) $f_n$ is a normal polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$, 
    (2) if $\alpha_n \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ is a root of $f_n$, then for any 
    proper divisor $d$ of $n$ the trace of $\alpha_n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ 
    is a root of $f_d$.
    
    The main goal of the dissertation is to give algorithms for
    construction of sequences of trace-compatible polynomials and to
    present explicit numerical data. An analogous notion of
    norm-compatible sequences is also introduced and studied.
    
    The dissertation consists of four chapters and a supplement, as
    follows: (1) Basic notions (1-31). (2) Presentation of the algebraic
    closure of a finite field (32-59). (3) Sequences of polynomials and
    sequences of elements (60-115). (4) Implementations (118-139). (5)
    Supplement (142-171).
    
    In chapters (1)–(3) various known results and algorithms are
    collected, and new results are added and compared with those
    previously used. 
    
    The numerical results in the supplement contain sequences of
    trace-compatible polynomials of degree $n$, where $n \le 100$, and
    $q=2,3,5,7,11,13$. For implementation, the computer-algebra system
    AXIOM has been used. The details contained in this dissertation are
    not readily describable in a short review.",

    simulations were done of established, and proposed, dynamic storage
    algorithms for the VM/SP operating system. Empirical evidence is given
    that simplifying statistical assumptions about the distribution of
    interarrival times and holding times has high predictive
    ability. Algorithms such as first-fit, modified first-fit, and
    best-fit are found to be CPU-inefficient. Buddy systems are found to
    be very fast but suffer from a high degree of internal
    fragmentation. A form of extended subpooling is shown to be as fast as
    buddy systems with improved storage efficiency. This algorithm was

  abstract =
    "Computer algebra started in 1953, and there were several systems in
    existence in the 1960's. Those inspired by physical applications
    largely implemented ``high school'' algebra and, from the point of
    view of today's much larger machines and more sophisticated
    programming languages, the miracle is that they worked at all, or as
    efficiently as they did.
    
    By the end of the 1960's it was clear that more sophisticated
    algorithms were necessary, either to solve problems for which the
    ``high school'' algorithms were inefficient on large data (e.g. gcd or
    factorization), or problems for which the ``high school'' techniques
    were not really algorithms at all (e.g. integration, solution of sets
    of equations).
    
    Hence the 1970's (and indeed much of the 1980's) were the ``age of
    algorithms''. It rapidly became obvious that these algorithms required
    more complex data structures and mathematical objects: finite fields,
    ideals, algebraic curves, divisor class groups to name but a few. This
    led to the growth of new systems, such as Axiom (formerly Scratchpad),
    Maple, Mathematica and Reduce 3. It is currently the case that many
    more algorithms are known than are implemented, and certainly that few
    systems implement even a reasonable cross-section of the known
    algorithms.
    
    At the present, there are two main trends. One is the rush to
    implement, which is causing a lot of duplication of work, but there is
    also a realisation that these systems need to be able to communicate,
    and that it is inherently impossible to have all the best algorithms
    in one system. To take an example, why implement from scratch enough
    group theory to analyse blocks of imprimitivity in a permutation
    group, when Cayley has all this and much more? However, parts of
    integration theory require this analysis.
    
    The other trend is the tendency to more ``structure-oriented''
    algorithms, i.e. algorithms which take accound of the structure of the
    problem. To name two, there is Gatemann's work on polynomial equation
    systems with symmetry, and Richardson's work on roots of polynomials
    which can be written as $p(x,x^n)$ with $p$ of low degree.
    
    The paper concludes with some speculations on the future of computer
    algebra.",

    new applications of canonical simplification of rational functions.

    essay is on a new, practical, canonical simplification algorithms

    "One of the important advantages held by computer algebra systems (CAS)
    over purely-numerical computational frameworks is that the CAS can
    provide a higher-level ``symbolic'' viewpoint for problem
    solving. Sometimes this can convert apparently impossible problems to
    trivial ones. Sometimes the symbolic perspective can provide
    information about questions which cannot be directly answered, or
    questions which might be hard to pose. For example, we might be able
    to analyze the asymptotic behavior of a solution to a differential
    equation even though we cannot solve the equation. One route to
    implicitly solving problems is the use of symmetry arguments. In this
    paper we suggest how, through symmetry, one can solve a large class of
    definite integration problems, including some that we found could not
    be solved by computer algebra systems. One case of symmetry provides
    for recognition of periodicity, and this solves additional problems,
    since removal of periodic components can be important in integration

    "In a numerical calculation sometimes we need higher-than
    double-precision floating-point arithmetic to allow us to be confident
    of a result. One alternative is to rewrite the program to use a
    software package implementing arbitrary-precision extended
    floating-point arithmetic such as ARPREC or MPFR, and try to choose a
    suitable precision.  
    
    Such an arithmetic scheme, in spite of helpful tools, may be
    inconvenient to write. There are also facilities in computer algebra
    systems (CAS) for such software-implemented ``bigfloats.'' These
    facilities are convenient if one is already using the CAS. In any of
    these situations the bigfloats may be rather slow, a cost of its
    generality.
    
    There are possibilities intermediate between the largest hardware
    floating-point format and the general arbitrary-precision software
    which combine a considerable (but not arbitrary) amount of extra
    precision with a (relatively speaking) modest factor loss in
    speed. Sometimes merely doubling the number of bits in a
    double-floating-point fraction is enough, in which case arithmetic on
    double-double (DD) operands would suffice. Another possibility is to
    go for yet another doubling to quad-double (QD) arithmetic: instead of
    using the machine double-floats to give about 16 decimal digits of
    precision, QD supplies about 64 digits. DD and QD as used here provide
    the same exponent range as ordinary double.
    
    Here we describe how we incorporated QD arithmetic implemented in a
    library into a Common Lisp system, providing a smooth interface while
    adding only modest overhead to the run-time costs (compared to
    accessing the library from C or C++). One advantage is that we keep
    the program text almost untouched while switching from double to
    quad-double. Another is that the programs can be written, debugged,
    and run in an interactive environment. Most of the lessons from QD can
    be used for other versions of arithmetic which can be embedded in
    Lisp, including MPFR, for indefinite (arbitrary) precision, should QD
    provide inadequate precision or range.",

    "Computer algebra systems (CAS) are supposed to do mathematics. 
    Unfortunately, much of human mathematics presentation and
    manipulation depends on humans to understand what is going on more
    generally. This context is often not made available to the computer
    system, and so it will sometimes fail to make the right guess at the
    meaning of constructions, unless they are made unambiguous. Among many
    issues, one that has been raised and resolved, is the need for
    attributing properties to operators that distinguish between ``the name
    of the operation'' and ``the operation itself''.  
    
    As a simple example, referential transparency requires that if $x = y$,
    then any true statement $P(x)$ about $x$ must be true about $y$, namely
    $P(y)$ is also true.
    
    Consider now the well-known equation $sin(0) = 0$, and the statement 
    $P(r) :=$ ``r = 0 is a rule to simplify the sin() function''.  The
    statement $P(sin(0))$ is clearly true. Therefore $P(0)$ should be true
    as well. It is not, since $0 = 0$ is not a rule to simplify $sin()$.
    
    The point here is that $sin(0)$ is not equal to 0 if sin is treated as
    the name of an operation. Perhaps it is a character string, or a data
    structure of some sort: a noun phrase. The corresponding expression
    including the verb form of sin is one in which $sin(0)$ can be
    simplified to something equivalent, but in some sense preferable. Here
    it is reasonable to replace it by 0.",

    that all of mathematics can be done by computer, or at least that we
    are on track for the continued ``arithmetization of mathematics.''
    Working mathematicians tend to disagree with the characterization that
    we are at all close now, nor that we are headed toward any goal of
    being able to do or understand mathematics.
    
    Most of the problems which we indicate below are actually quite
    general problems in computer-human communication. For specificity (and
    the possibility that one could qunatify a solution!) we will count our
    discussion of in terms of applications in the area of algebraic
    manipulation. If we cannot handle allegedly well-formed mathematical
    issues, how can we expect to handle ill-formed ambigious

    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed

    needed re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new

    the arithmetic or other operations.  For example, approximate floats
    do not have the mathematical properties of exact integers or
    rationals.  Complex numbers may strain a system designed for
    real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider two
    categories of “extended” numbers: ∞ or undefined, and real
    intervals. We comment on issues raised by these two troublesome
    notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra system may
    require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign of parts of
    the program, and how they are related. An alternative (followed most
    notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision a “meta” CAS
    defined in terms of categories and inheritance with only the most
    fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build many variants

    "The aim of this diploma thesis is the visualization of some
    fundamental results in the context of the theory of the modular group
    and modular functions. For this purpose the computer algebra software
    Mathematica is utilized.  

    The thesis is structured in three parts. In
    Chapter 1, we summarize some important basic concepts of group theory
    which are relevant to this work.  Moreover, we introduce obius
    transformations and study their geometric mapping properties. 

    Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of the modular group from an
    algebraic and geometric point of view. We introduce the canonical
    fundamental region which gives rise to the modular tessellation of
    the upper half-plane. Additionally, we present a general method
    for nding fundamental regions with respect to subgroups of the
    modular group based on the concepts of 2-dimensional hyperbolic
    geometry.

    In Chapter 3 we give some concrete examples how the developed results and
    methods can be exploited for the visualization of certain mathematical
    results. Besides the visualization of function graphs of modular
    functions, a particularly nice result is the connection between
    modular transformations and continued fraction expansions.",

    "SCRATCHPAD is a very large computer-algebra system implemented by the
    IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. It is available there on an IBM
    370, and it is available from other IBM corporate sites via
    telephone. Regrettably, this fine system has not yet been released to
    the public, but it is discussed here because of its novel features.
    
    In its entirety, the system occupies about 1600K bytes on an IBM 370
    with virtual storage, for which an additional minimum of 100 K bytes
    is recommeded for workspace. The variety of built-in transformations
    currently lies between that of REDUCE and MACSYMA. However, each of
    the three systems has features that none of the others possess, and
    one of these features may be a decisive advantage for a particular
    application. Here are some highlights of the SCRATCHPAD system:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The system provides single-precision floating-point arithmetic
    as well as indefinite-precision rational arithmetic
    \item The built-in unavoidable and optional algebraic transformations
    are approximately similar to those of MACSYMA.
    \item The built-in exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric
    transformations are approximately similar to those of REDUCE.
    \item Besides built-in symbolic matrix algebra, APL like array
    operations are included, and they are even further generalized to
    permit symbolic operations of nonhomogeneous arrays and on arrays
    of indefinite or infinite size.
    \item Symbolic differentiation and integration are built-in, with
    the latter employing the powerful Risch-Normal algorithm.
    \item There is a particularly elegant built-in facility for
    determining Taylor series expansions.
    \item There is a built-in SOLVE function capable of determining the
    exact solution to a system of linear equations.
    \item There is a powerful pattern-matching facility which serves as
    the primary mechanism for user level extensions. The associated syntax
    is at a very high level, being the closest of all computer algebra
    systems to the declarative, nonprocedural notation of mathematics.
    To implement the trigonometric multiple-angle expansions, we can
    merely enter the rewrite rules:
    \[cos(n*x) == 2*cos(x)*cos((n-1)*x)-cos((n-2)*x), n{\rm\ in\ }
    (2,3,...), x{\rm\ arb}\]
    \[sin(n*x) == 2*cos(x)*sin((n-1)*x)-sin((n-2)*x), n{\rm\ in\ }
    (2,3,...),x{\rm\ arb}\]
    Then, whenever we subsequently enter an expression such as 
    $cos(4*b)$, the response will be a corresponding expanded
    expression such as
    \[8*cos(B) - 8*cos^2(B)+1\]
    Thus, programs resemble a collection of math formulae, much as they
    would appear in a book or article.
    \item SCRATCHPAD has a particularly powerful yet easily used mechanism
    for controlling the output format of expressions.. For example, the user
    can specify that an expression be displayed as a power series in x,
    with coefficients which are factored rational functions in b and c,
    etc. For large expressions, such fine control over the output may
    mean the difference between an important new discovery and an
    inconprehensible mess.
    \end{itemize}
    
    This generalized recursive format idea is so natural and effective
    that SCRATCHPAD is now absorbing the idea into an internal 
    representation. A study of the polynomial additional algorithm in
    the previous section reveals that it is written to be applicable
    to any coefficient domain which has the algebraic properties of a
    {\sl ring}. The coefficients could be matrices, power-series, etc.
    That coefficient domain could in turn have yet another coefficient
    domain, and so on. With a careful modular design, packages to treat
    each of these domains can be dynamically linked together so that
    code can be shared and combined in new ways without extensive
    rewriting and duplication. Then not only the output, but also the
    internal computations can be selected most suitably for a particular
    application.

    parametric equations of curves and surfaces into implicit
    equations. The method proceeds via writing out the implicit polynomial
    $F$ of estimated degree with indeterminate coefficients $u_i$,
    substituting the rational expressions for the given parametric curve
    or surface into $F$ to yield a rational expression $g/h$ in the
    parameter $s$ (or $s$ and $t$), equating the coefficients of $g$ in
    terms of $s$ (and $t$) to 0 to generate a sparse, partially triangular
    system of linear equations in $u_i$ with constant coefficients, and
    finally solving the linear system for ui. If a nontrivial solution is
    found, then an implicit polynomial is obtained; otherwise, one repeats
    the same process, increasing the degree of $F$. Our experiments show
    that this simple method is efficient. It performs particularly well in
    the presence of base points and may detect the dependency of
    parameters incidentally.",

    "How do you solve the equation
    \[1.6^x = 5054.4 - 122.35*x\]
    We will refer to equations of this type, with an exponential
    expression on one side and a linear one on the other, as
    {\sl exponential-linear} equations. Numerical approaches such as Newton’s
    method or bisection quickly lead to accurate approximate solutions of
    exponential-linear equations. But in terms of the elementary functions
    of calculus and college algebra, there is no analytic solution.
    
    One approach to remedying this situation is to introduce a special
    function designed to solve exponential-linear equations. Quadratic
    equations, by way of analogy, are solvable in terms of the special
    function $\sqrt{x}$ , which in turn is simply the inverse of a very
    special and simple quadratic function. Similarly, exponential
    equations are solvable in terms of the natural logarithm {\sl log},
    and that too is the inverse of a very special function. So it is
    reasonable to ask whether there is a special function in terms of
    which exponential-linear equations might be solved. Furthermore, an
    obvious strategy for finding such a function is to invert some simple
    function connected with exponential-linear equations.
    
    This line of thinking proves to be immediately successful, and leads
    to a function I call {\sl glog} (pronounced {\sl gee-log}) which is a
    kind of generalized logarithm. As intended, glog can be used to solve
    exponential-linear equations. But that is by no means all it is good
    for. For example, with glog you can write a closed-form expression for
    the iterated exponential ($x^{x^{x^.}}$), and solve $x + y = x^y$ for
    $y$. The glog function is also closely related to another special
    function, called the Lambert $W$ function in [3] and [6], whose study
    dates to work of Lambert in 1758 and of Euler in 1777. Interesting
    questions about glog arise at every turn, from symbolic integration,
    to inequalities and estimation, to numerical computation. Elaborating
    these points is the goal of this paper.",

    "One of the most classical problems of mathematics is to solve systems
    of polynomial equations in several unknowns. Today, polynomial
    models are ubiquitous and widely applied across the sciences. They
    arise in robotics, coding theory, optimization, mathematical
    biology, computer vision, game theory, statistics, machine learning,
    control theory, and numerous other areas.  The set of solutions to a
    system of polynomial equations is an algebraic variety, the basic
    object of algebraic geometry. The algorithmic study of algebraic 
    varieties is the central theme of computational algebraic
    geometry. Exciting recent developments in symbolic algebra and
    numerical software for geometric calculations have revolutionized
    the field, making formerly inaccessible problems tractable, and
    providing fertile ground for experimentation and conjecture.
    
    The first half of this book furnishes an introduction and represents a
    snapshot of the state of the art regarding systems of polynomial
    equations.  Afficionados of the well-known text books by Cox, Little,
    and O’Shea will find familiar themes in the first five chapters:
    polynomials in one variable, Groebner bases of zero-dimensional
    ideals, Newton polytopes and Bernstein’s Theorem, multidimensional
    resultants, and primary decomposition.
    
    The second half of this book explores polynomial equations from a
    variety of novel and perhaps unexpected angles. Interdisciplinary
    connections are introduced, highlights of current research are
    discussed, and the author’s hopes for future algorithms are
    outlined. The topics in these chapters include computation of Nash
    equilibria in game theory, semidefinite programming and the real
    Nullstellensatz, the algebraic geometry of statistical models, the
    piecewise-linear geometry of valuations and amoebas, and the
    Ehrenpreis-Palamodov theorem on linear partial differential equations
    with constant coefficients.
    
    Throughout the text, there are many hands-on examples and exercises,
    including short but complete sessions in the software systems maple,
    matlab, Macaulay 2, Singular, PHC, and SOStools . These examples
    will be particularly useful for readers with zero background in
    algebraic geometry or commutative algebra. Within minutes, anyone can
    learn how to type in polynomial equations and actually see some
    meaningful results on the computer screen.",

    "Formal power series (FPS) of the form
    $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_k(x-x_0)^k}$ are important in calculus and
    complex analysis.  In some Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) it is
    possible to define an FPS by direct or recursive definition of its
    coefficients.  Since some operations cannot be directly supported
    within the FPS domain, some systems generally convert FPS to finite
    truncated power series (TPS) for operations such as addition,
    multiplication, division, inversion and formal substitution.  This
    results in a substantial loss of information.  Since a goal of
    Computer Algebra is - in contrast to numerical programming - to work
    with formal objects and preserve such symbolic information, CAS should
    be able to use FPS when possible.

    There is a one-to-one correspondence between FPS with positive radius
    of convergence and corresponding analytic functions.  It should be
    possible to automate conversion between these forms.  Among CASs
    only MACSYMA provides a procedure {\tt powerseries} to calculate FPS from
    analytic expressions in certain special cases, but this is rather
    limited.
    
    Here we give an algorithmic approach for computing an FPS for a
    function from a very rich family of functions including all of the
    most prominent ones that can be found in mathematical dictionaries
    except those where the general coefficient depends on the Bernoulli,
    Euler, or Eulerian numbers.  The algorithm has been implemented by the
    author and A.  Rennoch in the CAS MATHEMATICA, and by D.  Gruntz in
    MAPLE.
    
    Moreover, the same algorithm can sometimes be reversed to calculate a
    function that corresponds to a given FPS, in those cases when a
    certain type of ordinary differential equation can be solved.",

    Stoutemyer.
    
    While programs like Derive, Maple, Mathematica and Reduce are very
    powerful, they also have their fair share of problems. In particular,
    branches are somewhat of an Achilles' heel for them. As is well-known,
    the complex logarithm function is properly defined as a
    multiple-valued function. And since the general power and exponential
    functions are defined in terms of the logarithm function, they are
    also multiple-valued. But for actual computations, we need to make
    them single valued, which we do by choosing a branch. In Section 2, we
    will consider some transformation rules for branches of
    multiple-valued complex functions in painstaking detail.
    
    The purpose of this short article is not to do a comprehensive
    comparative study of different computer algebra systems. My goal is
    simply to make the readers aware of some of the problems, and to
    encourage the readers to sit down and experiment with their favourite

    to introduce the reader to some basic ideas of differential algebra in

    "Proving theorems is a creative act demanding new combinations of ideas
    and on occasion new methods of argument. For this reason, theorem
    proving systems need to be extensible. The provers should also remain
    correct under extension, so there must be a secure mechanism for doing
    this. The tactic-style provers pioneered by Edinburgh LCF provide a
    very effective way to achieve secure extensions, but in such systems,
    all new methods must be reduced to tactics. This is a drawback because
    there are other useful proof generating tools such as decision
    procedures; these include, for example, algorithms which reduce a
    deduction problem, such as arithmetic provability, to a computation on
    graphs.

    The Nuprl system pioneered the combination of fixed decision
    procedures with tactics, but the issue of securely adding new ones was
    not solved. In this paper, we show how to safely include user-defined
    decision procedures in theorem provers. The idea is to prove
    properties of the procedure inside the prover’s logic and then invoke
    a reflection rule to connect the procedure to the system. We also show
    that using a rich underlying logic permits an abstract account of the
    approach so that the results carry over to different implementations

    "In [Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 28, 457-478 (1975; Zbl 0332.35058)],
    M. E. Taylor described a constructive diagonalization method to
    investigate the reflection of singularities of the solution to
    first-order hyperbolic systems. According to further works initiated
    by Engquist and Majda, this approach proved to be well adapted to the
    construction of artificial boundary conditions. However, in the case
    of systems governed by pseudodifferential operators with variable
    coefficients, Taylor’s method involves very elaborate calculations of
    the symbols of the operators. Hence, a direct approach may be
    difficult when dealing with high-order conditions.

    This motivates the first part of this paper, where a recursive
    explicit formulation of Taylor’s method is stated for microlocally
    strictly hyperbolic systems. Consequently, it provides an algorithm
    leading to symbolic calculations which can be handled by a computer
    algebra system. In the second part, an application of the method is
    investigated for the construction of local radiation boundary
    conditions on arbitrarily shaped surfaces for the transverse electric
    Maxwell system. It is proved that they are of complete order, provided
    the introduction of a new symbols class well adapted to the Maxwell
    system. Next, a complete second-order condition is designed, and when
    used as an on-surface radiation condition [G. A. Kriegsmann,
    A. Taflove, and K. R. Umashankar, IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag. 35,
    153-161 (1987; Zbl 0947.78571)], it can give rise to an ultrafast

    the first algorithm, where the complete factorization of the 
    characteristic polynomial is needed, is $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot n^3)$. An
    iterative algorithm for finding the minimal polynomial has complexity
    $O(n^3+n^2m^2)$, where $m$ is a parameter of the shift Hessenberg
    matrix used. The method does not require the knowlege of the
    characteristic polynomial. The average value of $m$ is $O(log n)$.

    Next methods are discussed for finding a cyclic vector for a matrix.
    The authors first consider the case when its characteristic polynomial
    is squarefree. Using the shift Hessenberg form leads to an algorithm
    at cost $O(n^3 + n^2m^2)$. A more sophisticated recurrent procedure
    gives the result in $O(n^3)$ steps. In particular, a normal basis for
    an extended finite field of size $q^n$ will be obtained with complexity
    $O(n^3+n^2 log q)$.

    Finally, the Frobenius form is obtained with asymptotic average
    complexity $O(n^3 log n)$.",

    (DVM) has been derived. The rotational symmetry of the discrete
    velocities can be modelled algebraically by the action of the cyclic
    group $C_4$ -- or including reflections of the dihedral group $D_4$.
    Taking this point of view, the linearized collision operator can be
    represented in a compact form as a matrix of elements in the group
    algebra. Or in other words, by choosing a special numbering it
    exhibits a certain block structure which lets it appear as a matrix
    with entries in a certain polynomial ring. A convenient way for
    approaching such a structure is the use of a computer algebra system
    able to treat these (predefined) algebraic structures. We use the
    computer algebra system FriCAS/AXIOM [4,5] for the generation of the
    velocity and the collision sets and for the analysis of the structure
    of the collision operator. Concerning the fluid dynamic limit, the
    system provides the characterization of sets of collisions and their
    contribution to the flow parameters. It allows the design of
    rotationally invariant symmetric models for prescribed Prandtl

    portions of several systems have been combined and augmented to
    provide the following facilities to a user:(1) rational function
    manipulation and simplification; symbolic differentiation (Anthony
    Hearn's REDUCE)(2) symbolic integration (Joel Moses' SIN)(3)
    polynomial factorization, solution of linear differential equations,
    direct and inverse symbolic Laplace transforms (Carl Engelman's
    MATHLAB, including Knut Korsvold's simplification system)(4) unlimited
    precision integer arithmetic(5) manipulation of arrays containing
    symbolic entries(6) two-dimensional output on IBM 2741 terminals or
    IBM 2250 displays (William Martin's Symbolic Mathematical Laboratory,
    and Jonathan Millen's CHARYBDIS program from MATHLAB)(7)
    self-extending language facility (META/LISP).The user language created
    for the system incorporates a subset of ``customary'' mathematical
    notation. Data objects include sequences (both finite and infinite)
    and arrays of arbitrary rank. Assignment statements are the
    fundamental commands in the user language; they may contain
    ``for''-clauses which restrict the domain for which the assignment is
    valid and permit ``piecewise'' and recursive definition of new operators
    and functions. The user may also enter syntax definition statements in
    order to introduce new notations into the system.Expressions appearing
    in assignment statements may include ``where''-clauses which allow user
    control over the ``environment'' used in evaluation. Otherwise,
    evaluation of expressions occurs in the current environment created by
    the successive user commands, with certain operations such as
    integration, differentiation, and simplification performed
    automatically.Translators for the user language and for a resident
    higher-level procedural language facility are written in META/LISP, a
    new self-compiling translator-writing system. As a result, all input
    language facilities as well as the underlying manipulation routines
    may be interactively extended by an experienced user.",

    Dynamic evaluation is a technique for producing multiple results
    according to a decision tree which evolves with program execution.
    Sometimes it is desired to produce results for all possible branches
    in the decision tree, while on other occasions, it may be sufficient
    to compute a single result which satisfies certain properties. This
    techinique finds use in computer algebra where computing the correct
    result depends on recognizing and properly handling special cases of
    parameters. In previous work, programs using dynamic evaluation have
    explored all branches of decision trees by repeating the computations
    prior to decision points.

    This paper presents two new implementations of dynamic evaluation
    which avoid recomputing intermediate results. The first approach uses
    Scheme ``continuations'' to record state for resuming program
    execution. The second implementation uses the Unix ``fork'' operation
    to form new processes to explore alternative branches in parallel.",

  abstract =     "Dynamic evaluation is a technique for producing
                 multiple results according to a decision tree which
                 evolves with program execution. Sometimes we need to
                 produce results for all possible branches in the
                 decision tree, while on other occasions it may be
                 sufficient to compute a single result which satisfies
                 certain properties. This technique finds use in
                 computer algebra where computing the correct result
                 depends on recognising and properly handling special
                 cases of parameters. In previous work, programs using
                 dynamic evaluation have explored all branches of
                 decision trees by repeating the computations prior to
                 decision points. The paper presents two new
                 implementations of dynamic evaluation which avoid
                 recomputing intermediate results. The first approach
                 uses Scheme `continuations' to record the state for
                 resuming program execution. The second implementation
                 uses the Unix `fork' operation to form new processes to
                 explore alternative branches in parallel. These
                 implementations are based on modifications to Lisp- and
                 C-based run-time systems for the Axiom Version 2
                 extension language (previously known as $ A^{\mbox
                 {Hash}} $ ). This allows the same high-level source
                 code to be compared using the `re-evaluation', the
                 `continuation', and the `fork' implementations.",

    "One major goal of symbolic integrators is to determine under what
    circumstances the integral of the elementary functions of calculus can
    themselves be expressed as elementary functions.  While using tables
    and the ad hoc tricks taught in calculus courses can have some limited
    success, a decision procedure is necessary in all but the most trivial
    cases.  The first complete algorithm for solving this problem was
    presented by Risch in 1969, but its complexity, specially when
    algebraic functions are present in the integrand, has prevented it
    from being fully implemented.  Over the past 20 years, the Risch
    integration algorithm has been completed, extended, and improved to
    such a point that recent computer algebra systems can integrate
    elementary functions without using any of the heuristics traditionally
    taught in calculus courses and used by older systems.  In this talk,
    we give an overview and description of the algorithms used in the
    Scratchpad symbolic integrator, and illustrate them with integrals

    A major subproblem for algorithms that either factor ordinary linear
    differential equations or compute their closed form solutions is to
    find their solutions $y$ which satisfy $y^{'}/y \in \overline{K}(x)$
    where $K$ is the constant field for the coefficients of the equation.
    While a decision procedure for this subproblem was known in the
    $19^{th}$ century, it requires factoring polynomials over
    $\overline{K}$ and has not been implemented in full generality. We
    present here an efficient algorithm for this subproblem, which has
    been implemented in the AXIOM computer algebra system for equations of
    arbitrary order over arbitrary fields of characteristic 0. This
    algorithm never needs to compute with the individual complex
    singularities of the equation, and algebraic numbers are added only
    when they appear in the potential solutions.  Implementation of the
    complete Singer algorithm for $n=2,3$ based on this building block is

    principal parts of the Laurent series, in particular with the residues
    of the function, without factoring or splitting its denominator. As
    applications, we get a generalisation of the residue formulas used in
    symbolic integration algorithms to $n^{th}$-order formulas. We also
    get an algorithm that computes explicitly the principlal parts at all
    the poles simultaneously, while computing in the field generated by
    the coefficients of the series instead of the one generated by the
    poles of the function. This yields an improved version of the
    necessary conditions for the various cases of Kovacic's algorithm,

  abstract =
    "On December 30, 2003, Dick Jenks died at the age of 66, after an
    extended and courageous battle with multiple system atrophy.
    
    He received his PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign in 1966. The title of his dissertation was
    “Quadratic Differential Systems for Mathematical Models” and was
    written under the supervision of Donald Gilles. After completing his
    PhD, he was a post-doctoral fellow at Brookhaven National Laboratory
    on Long Island. In 1968 he joined IBM Research where he worked until
    his retirement in 2002.

    At IBM he was one of the principal architects of the Scratchpad
    system, one of the earliest computer algebra systems(1971). Dick
    always believed that natural user interfaces were essential and
    developed a user-friendly rule-based system for Scratchpad. Although
    this rule-based approach was easy to use, as algorithms for computer
    algebra became more complicated, he began to understand that an
    abstract data type approach would give sophisticated algorithm
    development considerably more leverage. In 1977 he began the Axiom
    development (originally called Scratchpad II) with the design of
    MODLISP, a merger of Lisp with types (modes). In 1980, with the help
    of many others, he completed an initial prototype design based on
    categories and domains that were intended to be natural for
    mathematically sophisticated users.
    
    During this period many researchers in computer algebra visited IBM
    Research in Yorktown Heights and contributed to the development of
    the Axiom system. All this activity made the computer algebra group at
    IBM one of the leading centers for research in this area and Dick was
    always there to organize the visits and provide a stimulating and
    pleasant working environment for everyone. He had a good perspective
    on the most important research directions and worked to attract
    world-renowned experts to visit and interact with his group. He was an
    ideal manager for whom to work, one who always put the project and the
    needs of the group members first. It was a joy to work in such a
    vibrant and stimulating environment.
    
    After many years of development, a decision was made to rename
    Scratchpad II to Axiom and to release it as a product. Dick and
    Robert Sutor were the primary authors of the book {\sl Axiom: The
    Scientific Computation System}.  In the foreword of the book, written
    by David and Gregory Chudnovsky, it is stated that ``The Scratchpad
    system took its time to blossom into the beautiful Axiom
    product. There is no rival to this powerful environment in its scope
    and, most importantly, in its structure and organization.'' Axiom was
    recently made available as free software. See
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom
    
    Dick was active in service to the computer algebra community as
    well. Here are some highlights. He served as Chair of ACM SIGSAM
    (1979-81) and Conference Co-chair (with J. A. van Hulzen) of EUROSAM
    ’84, a precursor of the ISSAC meetings. Dick also had a long period of
    service on the editorial board of the {\sl Journal of Symbolic
    Computation}. At ISSAC ’95 in Montreal, Dick was elected to the
    initial ISSAC Steering Committee and was elected as the second Chair
    of the Committee in 1997. He, along with David Chudnovsky, organized
    the highly successful meetings on Computers and Mathematics that were
    held at Stanford in 1986 and MIT in 1989. As a legacy of those
    meetings, the Jenks Prize for outstanding contributions to software 
    engineering in computer algebra has been established.
    
    Dick had many interests outside of his professional pursuits including
    reading, travel, physical fitness, and especially music. Dick was an
    accomplished pianist, organist, and vocalist. At one point he was the
    organist and choir master of the Church of the Holy Communion in
    Mahopac, NY. In the 1980s and 1990s, he sang in choral groups under
    the direction of Dr. Dennis Keene that performed at Lincoln Center in
    New York city.
    
    Personally, Dick was warm, generous, and outgoing with many
    friends. He will be missed for his technical accomplishments, his
    artist talents, and most of all for his positive, gentle, charming
    spirit.",

    $\varphi : g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mapsto g(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$.  In
    implementations this evaluation has been done using $p$-adic
    [H. Darmon and D. Ford, Commun. Algebra 17, No. 12, 2941-2943 (1989;
    Zbl 0693.12010)] or numerical (R. Stauduhar [ibid.]; Y. Eichenlaub and
    M. Olivier [preprint]) approximation of the roots.
    
    The paper under review presents a new approach which avoids all
    approximations: If $G \le H_i$ and $H_i$ is maximal in $H_{i-1}$ the
    invariant $h_i$ is a primitive element of the invariant field 
    $k_i=k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^{H_i}$ as an extension of 
    $k_{i-1}=K(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^{H_{i-1}}$.
    The author develops an algorithm to express the specialized values 
    $\varphi(g)$ of elements $g \in k_i$ in terms of $k_{i-1}$ and the 
    specialization $\varphi(h_i)$.
    
    This algorithm then is applied to the relative resolvent polynomial
    \[s_i = \prod_a{(y-a(x_1,\ldots,x_n))}\]
    where $a$ runs through the images of $h_i$ under $H_{i-1}$. 
    It has $y$-coefficients which are in $k_{i-1}$. 
    The algorithm then permits to express the coefficients of the
    specialization $r_i(y)=\varphi(s_i) \in k[y]$ recursively in the 
    (already known) specializations $\varphi(h_i)$ for $j \le i-1$,
    using the coefficients of $f$ (as $S_n$-invariants in the roots) 
    as a seed. A root of $r_i(y)$ in the base field then proves that $G$
    is contained in (a conjugate of) $H_i$, and this value of the root can 
    be used as specialized $\varphi(h_{i+1})$ in the next step of the 
    algorithm. Special care is given to the case when denominators of 
    elements in $k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ evaluate to zero after specialization.
    
    The paper closes with a short discussion of applicability. An
    implementation using AXIOM and GAP is in process but has not yet been
    completed.",

    "Let $(F)$ be a system of $p$ polynomial equations 
    $F_i({\bf X}) \in k[{\bf X}]$, where $k$ is a commutative field and 
    ${\bf X} := (X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ are indeterminates. Let $G$ be a subgroup
    of $GL_n(k)$. A polynomial $P \in k[{\bf X}]$ (resp. rational function 
    $P \in k({\bf X})$ ) is an invariant of $G$ if and only if for all 
    $A \in G$ we have $A\cdot P = P$. We denote $k[{\bf X}]^G$ by (resp. 
    $k({\bf X})^G$) the algebra of polynomial (resp. rational function) 
    invariants of $G$. If $L$ is another subgroup of $GL_n(k)$ such that 
    $G \subset L$, $P$ is called a primary invariant of $G$ relative to $L$ if 
    and only if $Stab_L(P) = G$ (where $Stab_L(P)$ is the stabilizer of 
    $P$ in $L$).

    The paper describes the algebra of the invariants of a finite group
    and how to express these invariants in terms of a small number of
    them, from both the Cohen-Macaulay algebra and the field theory points
    of view. A method is proposed to solve $(F)$ by expressing it in terms of
    primary invariants $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n$
    (e.g. the elementary symmetric polynomials) and one
    ``primitive'' secondary invariant.
    
    The main thrust of the paper is contained in the following theorem. 
    Let $(F)$ be a set of invariants of $G$. Let $L$ be a subgroup of 
    $GL_n(k)$ such that $G \subset L$ and $k({\bf X})^L$ is a purely 
    transcendental extension of $k_i$, let $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n$ be 
    polynomials such that $k({\bf X})^L = k(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n)$,
    and let $\Theta \in k[{\bf X}]^G$ be a primitive polynomial invariant 
    of $G$ relative to $L$.
    When possible, it is convenient to choose $\Theta$ to be one of the
    polynomials in $(F)$. – An algorithm is given that allows each polynomial
    $F_i$ to be expressed as $F_i({\bf X}) = H_i(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)$, 
    an algebraic fraction in $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n$ and a polynomial in
    $\Theta$. Now let $L$ be the minimal polynomial of $\Theta$ over 
    $k[{\bf X}]^L$; we have 
    \[L({\bf X},T)=\prod_{\Theta^{'} \in L\cdot \Theta}(T-\Theta^{'})
    \in k[{\bf X}]^L[T]\]
    (where $L$ is called a generic Lagrange resolvent). 
    As $k(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n)=k({\bf X})^L$, we can write 
    $L({\bf X},T)=H_0(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,T)$ where $H_0$ is some
    rational function. The question 
    $H_0(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)=0$ is always satisfied because 
    $\Theta$ is a root of $L$. Then, we solve the system of ($p=1$) 
    algebraic equations $H_i(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)=0$,
    $0 \le i \le p$ for $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta$ as indeterminates.
    
    Theorem 1: Let $D \in k[\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n]$ be the LCM of the 
    denominators of all the fractions $H_i$,$0 \le i \le p$ and let 
    $H_i^{'}=DH_i$. For every solution 
    $x:=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ of the system $(F)$:$F_i({\bf X})=0$,
    $1 \le i \le p$, there exists a solution ($\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n,\Theta$)
    of the system 
    $(H^{'}):H_i^{'}(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)=0$, $0 \le i \le p$ such 
    that $x$ is a solution of the system 
    $(P_\pi):\Pi_i({\bf X})=\pi_i$, $1 \le i \le n$ , and of the equation 
    $\Theta({\bf X})=0$. Conversely, for any solution 
    $(\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n,\theta)$ of the system $(H^{'})$ such that 
    $D(\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n) \ne 0$, if $x$ is a solution of the system 
    $(P_\pi)$ relative to $(\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n)$, then there exists 
    some $A \in L$ such that $\Theta(A\cdot x)=\theta$, and then for all 
    $B \in G$, $BA\cdot x$, is a solution of the system $(F)$.
    
    A slighly more general version of this theorem is also given. The
    paper then presents an algorithm that applies the theory and has been
    implemented in AXIOM. It is followed by several examples.",

    "Around 1980 two new directions in science and technique came
    together. One was Buchberger’s algorithms in order to handle Groebner
    bases in an effective way for solving polynomial equations. The second
    one was the development of the personal computers. This was the
    starting point of a computational perspective in commutative algebra
    and algebraic geometry. In 1991 the three authors invented the first
    edition of their book as an introduction for undergraduates to some
    interesting ideas in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry with a
    strong perspective to practical and computational aspects. A second
    revised edition appeared in 1996. That means from the very beginning
    the book provides a bridge for the new, computational aspects in the
    field of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

    To be more precise, the book gives an introduction to Buchberger’s
    algorithm with applications to syzygies, Hilbert polynomials, primary
    decompositions. There is an introduction to classical algebraic
    geometry with applications to the ideal membership problem, solving
    polynomial equations, and elimination theory. Some more spectacular
    applications are about robotics, automatic geometric theorem proving,
    and invariants of finite groups. It seems to the reviewer to carry
    coals to Newcastle for estimating the importance and usefulness of the
    book. It should be of some interest to ask how many undergraduates
    have been introduced to algorithmic aspects of commutative algebra and
    algebraic geometry following the line of the book. The reviewer will
    be sure that this will continue in the future too.  

    What are the changes to the previous editions? There is a significant
    shorter proof of the Extension Theorem, see 3.6 in Chapter 3,
    suggested by A.H.M. Levelt. A major update has been done in Appendix C
    ``Computer Algebra Systems''. This concerns in the main the section
    about MAPLE. Some minor updated information concern the use of AXIOM,
    CoCoA, Macaulay2, Magma, Mathematica, and SINGULAR. This reflects
    about the recent developments in Computer Algebra Systems. It
    encourages an interested reader to more practical exercises. The
    authors have made changes on over 200 pages to enhance clarity and
    correctness. Many individuals have reported typographical errors and
    gave the authors feedback on the earlier editions. The book is
    well-written. The reviewer guesses that it will become more and more
    difficult to earn 1 dollar (sponsored by the authors) for every new
    typographical error as it was the case also with the first and second
    edition. The reviewer is sure that it will be a excellent guide to
    introduce further undergraduates in the algorithmic aspect of
    commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.",

    "Timothy Daly presents Axiom 

    Timothy Daly, published author, academic researcher, open source
    programmer and lead developer of Axiom will be presenting about his role
    as the driving force behind Axiom.  With over 70 developers and 200
    researchers worldwide it can best be described as:

    Axiom is a general purpose Computer Algebra system. It is useful
    for research and development of mathematical algorithms providing
    a very high level way to express abstract mathematical concepts.
    The Axiom Library defines over 1,000 strongly-typed mathematical
    domains and categories.

    Axiom consists of an interpreter and compiler, a browser, a graphical
    interface, and a new online wiki that allows users to create web pages
    that inline computations.

    Axiom is built upon Common Lisp.",

    trivial. When it is shown to be non-trivial, we are often
    surprised. As is often the case, the computerization of
    mathematical computation in computer algebra systems on the one
    hand, and mathematical reasoning in theorem provers on the other
    hand, forces us to explore the issue of equality in greater
    detail.In practice, there are also several ambiguities in the
    definition of equality. For example, we refer to $\mathbb{Q}(x)$
    as ``rational functions'', even though $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ and
    $x+1$ are not equal as functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to
    $\mathbb{R}$, since the former is not defined at $x=1$, even
    though they are equal as elements of $\mathbb{Q}(x)$. The aim of
    this paper is to point out some of the problems, both with
    mathematical equality and with data structure equality, and to
    explain how necessary it is to keep a clear distintion between the two.",

                 authors begin by explaining the background that led the
                 Scratchpad group to construct such a general theory.
                 They contrast the general theory in Scratchpad with
                 Reduce-3's theory of domains, which is in many ways
                 more limited, but is the closest approach to an
                 implemented general theory to be found outside
                 Scratchpad. This leads them to describe the general
                 Scratchpad view of data types and categories, and the
                 possibilities it offers. They then digress a little to
                 ask what criteria should be adopted in choosing what
                 types to define. Having discussed the philosophical

    This paper explains how Scratchpad solves the problem of presenting a
    categorical view of factorization in unique factorization domains,
    i.e.  a view which can be propagated by functors such as
    SparseUnivariatePolynomial or Fraction. This is not easy, as the
    constructive version of the classical concept of
    UniqueFactorizationDomain cannot be so propagated. The solution
    adopted is based largely on Seidenberg's conditions (F) and (P), but
    there are several additional points that have to be borne in mind to
    produce reasonably efficient algorithms in the required generality.

    The consequence of the algorithms and interfaces presented in this
    paper is that Scratchpad can factorize in any extension of the
    integers or finite fields by any combination of polynomial, fraction
    and algebraic extensions: a capability far more general than any other
    computer algebra system possesses. The solution is not perfect: for
    example we cannot use these general constructions to factorize
    polyinmoals in $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}[x]$ since the domain
    $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a unique factorization domain, even though
    $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}$ is, since it is a field. Of course, we can
    factor polynomials in $\overline{Z}[\sqrt{-5}][x]$",

    family. The user must be able to understand in which way these
    parameters affect the result when he looks at the answer. Otherwise it
    may lead to completely wrong calculations, which when used for
    numerical applications bring nonsensical answers. This is the case in
    most current Computer Algebra Systems we know because the form of the
    answer is never explicitly conditioned by the values of the
    parameters. The user is not even informed that the given answer may be
    wrong in some cases then computer algebra systems can not be entirely
    trustworthy. We have introduced multi-valued expressions called
    conditional expressions, in which each potential value is associated
    with a condition on some parameters. This is used, in particular, to
    capture the situation in integration, where the form of the answer can
    depend on whether certain quantities are positive, negative or

    "Dynamic evaluation is a general method for computing with parameters
    [6, 9]. In 1994, T. Gomez-Diaz implemented the dynamic constructible
    closure in the scientific computation system Axiom [17]: by simulating
    dynamic evaluation, it offers the possibility to compute with
    parameters in a very large way [13]. The outputs of a calculs with
    T. Gomez-Diaz programs are represented by a finite collection of
    constructible triangular systems defined in [12, definition
    p.106]. Though there are numerous applications of these programs
    (notably polynomial system solving with parameters [11], automatic
    geometric theorem proving [14, 15], computation of Jordan forms with
    parameters [16]), nobody gives theorical interest to this kind of
    triangular systems. The main reason of this phenomenon is that they
    are definied in [12] within the dynamic evaluation context. On the
    opposite, most notions of triangular systems (J.F. Ritt-W.T. Wu
    characteristic sets [24, 28], M. Kalkbrener regular chains [18],
    D. Lazard triangular sets [20], M. Moreno Maza regular sets [22],
    D.M. Wang simple systems [26, 27]) are defined in terms of commutative
    algebra. This problem is at the origin of the work done in [7] where
    we give a relevant algebraic model of T. Gomez-Diaz systems within
    commutative algebra terminology. This allows us to relate them to many
    concepts of triangular systems [7]. Thus, we give interest to the
    connections with D. Lazard triangular sets in [8]. In a way, this
    paper is the continuation of this previous work. This time, we study
    relationships between T. Gomez-Diaz systems and D.M. Wang simple
    systems. The paper is structured as follows. We have collected in
    section 2 some needed notations. In section 3, we give all the
    terminology related to our algebraic model of T. Gomez-Diaz
    systems. Thus, we define the notion of weak constructible triangular
    systems and introduce the properties of normalization and
    squarefreeness. Section 4 is more detailed.  First of all, we study a
    weaker form of normalization called $L$-normalization. Then we give
    many properties of constructible triangular systems verifying this new
    notion. We obtain an algebraic and geometric framework which permits,
    in section 5, to explore the connections between T. Gomez-Diaz systems
    and D.M. Wang simple systems. In particular, this last section will
    demonstrate well the importance of our $L$-normalization
    property. Indeed, we show that simple systems and squarefree
    $L$-normalized constructible triangular systems are equivalent.",

    "A survey of symbolic methods for factoring linear differential
    operators is given. Starting from basic notions – ring of operators,
    differential Galois theory – methods for finding rational and
    exponential solutions that can provide first order right-hand factors
    are considered. Subsequently several known algorithms for
    factorization are presented. These include Singer’s eigenring
    factorization algorithm, factorization via Newton polygons, van
    Hoeij’s methods for local factorization, and an adapted version of
    Pade approximation.
    
    In addition a procedure based on pure algebraic methods for factoring
    second order linear partial differential operators is
    developed. Splitting an operator of this kind reduces to solving a
    system of linear algebraic equations. Those solutions which satisfy a
    certain different ial condition, immediately produce linear factors of
    the operator. The method applies also to operators of third order,
    thereby resulting in a more complicated system of equations. In
    contrast to the second order case, differential equations must also be
    solved, which, in particular cases, are simplified with the aid of
    characteristic sets.
    
    Finally, complete decomposition into linear factors of ordinary
    differential operators of arbitrary order is discussed. A splitting
    formula is developed, provided that a linear basis of solutions is
    available.  This theoretical representation is valuable in
    understanding the nature of the classical Beke algorithm and its
    variants like the algorithm LODEF by Schwarz and the Beke-Bronstein
    algorithm.",

    "Many problems in computer algebra, as well as in high-school
    exercises, are such that their statement only involves integers but
    their solution involves complex numbers. For example, the complex
    numbers $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ appear in the solutions of
    elementary problems in various domains. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item in {\bf integration}:
    \[\int{\frac{dx}{x^2-2}} = \frac{Log(x-\sqrt{2})}{2\sqrt{2}}
    +\frac{Log(x-(-\sqrt{2}))}{2(-\sqrt{2})}\]

    1 & -1

    $y^2+x^2=1$ at the points
    \[(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}) {\rm\ and\ }(-\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2})\]
    \end{itemize}
    Of course, more ``complicated'' complex numbers appear in more
    complicated examples.

    But two facts have to be emphasized:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item in general, if a problem is stated over the integers (or over
    the field $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers), the complex numbers that
    appear are {\sl algebraic} complex numbers, which means that they are
    roots of some polynomial with rational coefficients, like $\sqrt{2}$
    and $-\sqrt{2}$ are roots of $T^2-2$.
    \item Similar problems appear with base fields different from
    $mathbb{Q}$. For example finite fields, or fields of rational
    functions over $\mathbb{Q}$ or over a finite field. The general
    situation is that a given problem is stated over some ``small field''
    $K$, and its solution is expressed in an {\sl algebraic closure}
    $\overline{K}$ of $K$, which means that this solution involves numbers
    which are roots of polynomials with coefficients in $K$.
    \end{itemize}

    The aim of this paper is to describe an implementation of an algebraic
    closure domain constructor in the language Scratchpad II, simply
    called Scratchpad below. In the first part we analyze the problem, and
    in the second part we describe a solution based on the D5 system.",

    "C++ templates are key to the design of current successful mainstream
    libraries and systems. They are the basis of programming techniques in
    diverse areas ranging from conventional general-purpose programming to
    software for safety-critical embedded systems. Current work on improving
    templates focuses on the notion of {\sl concepts} (a type system for
    templates), which promises significantly improved error diagnostics and
    increased expressive power such as concept-based overloading and function
    template partial specialization. This paper presents C++ templates with
    an emphasis on problems related to separate compilation. We consider the
    problem of how to express concepts in a precise way that is simple enough
    to be usable by ordinary programmers. In doing so, we expose a few
    weaknesses of the current specification of the C++ standard library and
    suggest a far more precise and complete specification. We also present
    a systematic way of translating our proposed concept definitions, based
    on use-patterns rather than function signatures, into constraint sets
    that can serve as convenient basis for concept checking in a compiler.",

    "Computer algebra systems are large collections of routines for solving
    mathematical problems algorithmically, efficiently and above all,
    symbolically. The more advanced and rigorous computer algebra systems
    (for example, Axiom) use the concept of strong types based on
    order-sorted algebra and category theory to ensure that operations are
    only applied to expressions when they ``make sense''.

    In cases where Axiom uses notions which are not covered by current
    mathematics we shall present new mathematics which will allow us to
    prove that all such cases are reducible to cases covered by the
    current theory. On the other hand, we shall also point out all the
    cases where Axiom deviates undesirably from the mathematical ideal.
    Furthermore we shall propose solutions to these deviations.

    Strongly typed systems (especially of mathematics) become unusable
    unless the system can change the type in a way a user expects. We wish
    any change expected by a user to be automated, ``natural'', and
    unique. ``Coercions'' are normally viewed as ``natural type changing
    maps''. This thesis shall rigorously define the word ``coercion'' in
    the context of computer algebra systems.

    We shall list some assumptions so that we may prove new results so
    that all coercions are unique. This concept is called ``coherence''.

    We shall give an algorithm for automatically creating all coercions in
    type system which adheres to a set of assumptions. We shall prove that
    this is an algorithm and that it always returns a coercion when one
    exists. Finally, we present a demonstration implementation of this
    automated coerion algorithm in Axiom.",

    "In applied mathematics, electronic and chemical engineering, the
    modelling process can produce a number of mathematical problems which
    require numerical solutions for which symbolic methods are either not
    possible or not obvious. With the plethora of numerical library
    routines for the solution of these problems often the numerical
    analyst has to answer the question {\sl Which routine to choose?} and
    {\sl How do I use it?}. Some analysis needs to be carried out before
    the appropriate routine can be identifed, i.e. {\sl How stiff is this
    ODE?} and {\sl Is this function continuous?}. It may well be the case
    that more than one routine is applicable to the problem. So the
    question may become {\sl Which is likely to be the best?}. Such a
    choice may be critical for both accuracy and efficiency.
    
    An expert system is thus required to make this choice based on the
    results of its own analysis of the problem, call the routine and act
    on the outcome. This may be to put the answer in a relevant form or
    react to an apparent failure of the chosen routine and thus choose and
    call an alternative. It should also have sufficient explanation
    mechanisms to inform on the choice of routine and the reasons for that
    choice. Much of this work can be achieved using computer algebra and
    symbolic algebra packages.
    
    This paper describes an expert system currently in prototype in terms
    of both its object-based structure and its computational agents. Some
    of these agents are described in detail, paying particular attention
    to the practical aspects of their algorithms and the use of computer
    algebra.
    
    The {\bf axiom2} Symbolic Algebra System is used as a user interface
    as well as the link to the NAG Foundation Library for the numerical
    routines and the inference mechanisms for the expert system.",

    given problem, should there be a choice.
    
    Compuer Algebra Systems use generic names for each problem area. For
    examples, 'integrate' (or 'int') is used for integration of a
    function, whatever method the code may use. Numeric interfaces still
    use different names for each method together with a variety of extra
    parameters, some of which may be optional. Ideally, we should extend
    the generic name structure to cover numerical routines. This would
    then, necessarily, require algorithms for making an assessment of the
    efficacy of different methods where such a choice exists.

                 One consequence is that the shape of the solutions may,

    "In the recent decades, it has been more and more realized that
    computers are of enormous importance for numerical
    computations. However, these powerful general-purpose machines can
    also be used for transforming, combining and computing symbolic
    algebraic expressions. In other words, computers can not only deal
    with numbers, but also with abstract symbols representing mathematical
    formulas. This fact has been realized much later and is only now
    gaining acceptance among mathematicians and engineers. [Franz Winkler,
    1996].
    
    Computer Algebra is that field of computer science and mathematics,
    where computation is performed on symbols representing mathematical
    objects rather than their numeric values.
    
    This thesis attempts to present a definition of computer algebra by
    means of a survey of its main topics, together with its major
    application areas. The survey includes necessary algebraic basics and
    fundamental algorithms, essential in most computer algebra problems,
    together with some problems that rely heavily on these algorithms. The
    set of applications, presented from a range of fields of engineering
    and science, although very short, indicates the applied nature of
    computer algebra systems.
    
    A recent research area, central in most computer algebra software
    packages and in geometric modeling, is the implicitization
    problem. Curves and surfaces are naturally reperesented either
    parametrically or implicitly. Both forms are important and have their
    uses, but many design systems start from parametric
    representations. Implicitization is the process of converting curevs
    and surfaces from parametric form into implicit form.
    
    We have surveyed the problem of implicitization and investigated its
    currently available methods. Algorithms for such methods have been
    devised, implemented and tested for practical examples. In addition, a
    new method has been devised for curves for which a direct method is
    not available. The new method has been called {\sl near implicitization}
    since it relies on an approximation of the input problem. Several
    variants of the method try to compromise between accuracy and
    complexity of the designed algorithms.
    
    The problem of implicitization is an active topic where research is
    still taking place.  Examples of further research points are included
    in the conclusion",

    the framework is the notion of a biform theory which is simultaneously
    an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic theory. Representing a
    collection of mathematical models, a biform theory provides a formal
    context for both deduction and computation. The framework includes
    facilities for deriving theorems via a mixture of deduction and
    computation, constructing sound deduction and computation rules, and
    developing networks of biform theories linked by interpretations. The
    framework is not tied to a specific underlying logic; indeed, it is
    intended to be used with several background logics
    simultaneously. Many of the ideas and mechanisms used in the framework
    are inspired by the IMPS Interactive Mathematical Proof System and the

    "Ideally the transformations performed by MACSYMA's simplification
    program on algebraic expressions correspond to those simplifications
    desired by each user and each program.  Since it is impossible for a
    program to intuit all users' requirements simultaneously, explicit
    control of the simplifier is necessary to override default
    transformations.  A model of the simplification process is helpful in
    controlling this large and complex program.
    
    Having examined several algebraic simplification programs, it appears
    that to date no program has been written which combines a conceptually
    simple and useful view of simplification with a program nearly as
    powerful as MACSYMA's.  {note, 1979. not clear this would be different
    in 2001.  RJF} Rule-directed transformation schemes struggle to
    approach the power of the varied control structures in more usual
    program schemes [Fenichel, 68].  {note, Mathematica pushes rules
    further. RJF}
    
    It is our belief that a thorough grasp of the decision and data
    structures of the MACSYMA simplifier program itself is the most direct
    way of understanding its potential for algebraic expression
    transformation.  This is an unfortunate admission to have to make, but
    it appears to reflect the state of the art in dealing with
    formalizations of complex programs.  Simplification is a perplexing
    task.  Because of this, we feel it behooves the ``guardians of the
    simplifier'' to try to meet the concerned MACSYMA users part-way by
    documenting the program as it has evolved.  We hope this paper
    continues to grow to reflect a reasonably accurate, complete, and
    current description.
    
    Of course Lisp program details are available to the curious, but even
    for those without a working knowledge of the Lisp language (in which
    the simplifier is written) we expect this paper to be of some help in
    answering questions which arise perennially as to why MACSYMA deals
    with some particular class of expressions in some unanticipated
    fashion, or is inefficient in performing some set of transformations.
    Most often difficulties such as these are accounted for by implicit
    design decisions which are not evident from mere descriptions of what
    is done in the anticipated and usual cases.  We also hope that
    improvements or revisions of the simplifier will benefit from the more
    centralized treatment of issues given here.  We also provide
    additional commentary which reflects our current outlook on how
    simplification programs should be written, and what capabilities they
    should have.",

    ``That's what the name is called. The name really is 'The Aged Aged Man'''

    ``Then I ought to have said 'That's what the song is called?'' Alice
    corrected herself.

    ``No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The song is called
    `Ways and Means': but that's only what it's called, you know!''

    ``Well, what is the song, then?'' said Alice, who was by this time
    completely bewildered.

    `A-sitting on a Gate': and the tune's my own invention.''",

  title = {{Building Algebra Systems by Overloading Lisp}},

  abstract = "
    Some of the earliest computer algebra systems (CAS) looked like
    overloaded languages of the same era. FORMAC, PL/I FORMAC, Formula
    Algol, and others each took advantage of a pre-existing language base
    and expanded the notion of a numeric value to include mathematical
    expressions. Much more recently, perhaps encouraged by the growth in
    popularity of C++, we have seen a renewal of the use of overloading to
    implement a CAS.

    This paper makes three points. 1. It is easy to do overloading in
    Common Lisp, and show how to do it in detail. 2. Overloading per se
    provides an easy solution to some simple programming problems. We show
    how it can be used for a ``demonstration'' CAS. Other simple and
    plausible overloadings interact nicely with this basic system. 3. Not
    all goes so smoothly: we can view overloading as a case study and
    perhaps an object lesson since it fails to solve a number of
    fairly-well articulated and difficult design issues in CAS for which
    other approaches are preferable.",

    "Any design for a computer algebra system (CAS) naturally includes a
    set of data layouts for symbolic or mathematical algebraic expressions
    intended for use by built-in or user-written programs. The CAS cannot
    build in all plausible data designs, but supports those of most
    interest to the programmers. In such a situation it is almost
    inevitable that some new data encoding idea will come to mind and with
    it an interest in adding additional data forms. The motivation may be
    for compact representation, or efficient (fast) manipulation, or for
    other reasons such as interchange with other programs. Most CAS
    therefore include at least one way to extend the base set of
    operations. We comment on the kinds of extensions possible, using
    Macsyma as an example CAS. The particular interest in Macsyma and its
    open-source soruceforge variant ``Maxima'' is that a substantial group
    of very-losely coupled independent researchers are approaching this
    problem and may benefit from some guidance. Some the observations
    apply to other CAS, even though they are not open-source.",

    "Machine element analysis has a goal of describing function and other
    aspects of machine elements in a theoretical form. This paper shows
    how ideas from object-oriented modelling can be applied to machine
    elment analysis. The models thus obtained are both easier to
    understand, better structured, and allow a higher degree of re-use
    than conventional models. An object-oriented model description is
    natural and suitable for machine element analysis. As a realistic
    example an equational model of rolling bearings is presented. The
    structure of the model is general, and applies to many types of
    rolling bearings. The model and one solution require approximately
    200+200 equations. The model is extensible, e.g. simple submodels of
    detailed properties can be made more complex without altering the
    overall structure. The example model has been implemented in a
    language of our own design. ObjectMath (Object-oriented Mathematical
    language for scientific computing). Using ObjectMath, it is possible
    to model classes of equation objects, to support multiple and single
    inheritance of equations, to support composition of equations, and to
    solve systems of equations. Algebraic transformations can conveniently
    be done since ObjectMath models are translated into the Mathematica
    computer algebra language. When necessary, equations can be
    transformed int C++ code for efficient numerical solution. The re-use
    of equations through inheritance reduced the size of the model by a
    factor of two, compared to a direct representation of the model in the
    Mathematica computer algebra language.",

    "Computer Algebra (CA) is the name given to the discipline of
    algebraic, rather than numerical, computation. There are a number of
    computer programs – Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) – available for
    doing this. The most widely used general-purpose systems that are
    currently available commercially are Axiom, Derive, Macsyma, Maple,
    Mathematica and REDUCE. The discipline of computer algebra began in
    the early 1960s and the first version of REDUCE appeared in 1968.
    
    A large class of mathematical problems can be solved by using a CAS
    purely interactively, guided only by the user documentation. However,
    sophisticated use requires an understanding of the considerable amount
    of theory behind computer algebra, which in itself is an interesting
    area of constructive mathematics. For example, most systems provide
    some kind of programming language that allows the user to expand or
    modify the capabilities of the system.
    
    This book is probably the most general introduction to the theory of
    computer algebra that is written as a textbook that develops the
    subject through a smooth progression of topics. It describes not only
    the algorithms but also the mathematics that underlies them. The book
    provides an excellent starting point for the reader new to the
    subject, and would make an excellent text for a postgraduate or
    advanced undergraduate course. It is probably desirable for the reader
    to have some background in abstract algebra, algorithms and
    programming at about second-year undergraduate level.
    
    The book introduces the necessary mathematical background as it is
    required for the algorithms. The authors have avoided the temptation
    to pursue mathematics for its own sake, and it is all sharply focused
    on the task of performing algebraic computation. The algorithms are
    presented in a pseudo-language that resembles a cross between Maple
    and C. They provide a good basis for actual implementations although
    quite a lot of work would still be required in most cases. There are
    no code examples in any actual programming language except in the
    introduction.
    
    The authors are all associated with the group that began the
    development of Maple. Hence, the book reflects the approach taken by
    Maple, but the majority of the discussion is completely independent of
    any actual system. The authors’ experience in implementing a practical
    CAS comes across clearly.
    
    The book focuses on the core of computer algebra. The first chapter
    introduces the general concept and provides a very nice historical
    survey. The next three chapters discuss the fundamental topics – data
    structures, representations and the basic arithmetic of integers,
    rational numbers, multivariate polynomials and rational functions – on
    which the rest of the book is built.
    
    A major technique in CA involves projection onto one or more
    homomorphic images, for which the ground ring is usually chosen to be
    a finite field. The image solution is lifted back to the original
    problem domain by means of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the case
    of multiple homomorphic images, or the Hensel (-adic or ideal-adic)
    construction in the case of a single image. The next two chapters are
    devoted to these techniques in a fairly general setting. The two
    subsequent chapters specialise them to GCD computation and
    factorisation for multivariate polynomials; the first of these
    chapters also discusses the important but difficult topic of
    subresultants.
    
    The next two chapters describe the use of fraction-free Gaussian
    elimination, resultants and Gröbner Bases for manipulation and exact
    solution of linear and nonlinear polynomial equations. The two final
    chapters describe ``classical'' algorithms and the more recent Risch
    algorithm for symbolic indefinite integration, and provide an
    introduction to differential algebra.
    
    The book does not consider more specialised problem areas such as
    symbolic summation, definite integration, differential equations,
    group theory or number theory. Nor does it consider more applied
    problem areas such as vectors, tensors, differential forms, special
    functions, geometry or statistics, even though Maple and other CASs
    provide facilities in all or many of these areas. It does not consider
    questions of CA programming language design, nor any of the important
    but non-algebraic facilities provided by current CASs such as their
    user interfaces, numerical and graphical facilities.
    
    This is a long book (nearly 600 pages); it is generally very well
    presented and the three authors have merged their contributions
    seamlessly. I noticed very few typographical errors, and none of any
    consequence. I have only two complaints about the book. The typeface
    is too small, particularly for the relatively large line spacing used,
    and it is much too expensive, particularly for a book that would
    otherwise be an excellent student text. I recommend it highly to
    anyone who can afford it.",

    "One of the most important applications of Buchberger's algorithm for
    Groebner basis computation is the solution of systems of polynomial
    equations (having finitely many roots), i.e. the computation of zeros
    of 0-dimensional polynomial ideals. It is based on a relation between
    Groebner bases w.r.t. a lexicographical ordering and elimination
    ideals, which was discovered by Trinks.

    Packages for isolation of real roots of systems of polynomial
    equations using Groebner basis computation are currently available in
    different computer algebra systems, including SAC-2, Reduce,
    Scratchpad II, Maple.
    
    In principle, Buchberger-Trinks algorithm should allow to compute
    solutions of such systems in the algebraic closure of the coefficient
    field $k$ (usually the rational numbers), in the sense that it is
    possible to represent explicitly a finite extension of $k$ containing
    all solutions and to express the roots in this field.
    
    However, this requires several factorisations of polynomials over a
    tower of algebraic extensions of $k$, which is usually very costly, so
    that the resulting algorithm is not very feasible and, as far as we
    know, no implementation is available.
    
    The results of [GT2] on primary decomposition of ideals include a
    thorough study on the structure of Groebner bases for 0-dimensional
    ideals; in particular, the paper shows, that after a ``generic''
    linear change of coordinates, the roots of a system of polynomial
    equations can be expressed in a simple extension of $k$. Therefore, in
    this case, no factorisation of polynomials over towers of algebraic
    extensions is needed.
    
    However performing a change of coordinates has the undesirable effects
    of introducing dense polynomials and of increasing the size of
    coefficients.
    
    The problem then arises of producing strategies to compute Groebner
    bases for (0-dimensional) ideals, which at least are able to control
    the influence of these side-effects: two such strategies are presented
    in this paper, together with the application to the present problem of
    an algorithm by Gianni that computes the radical of a 0-dimensional
    ideal after a ``generic'' change of coordinates.
    
    A different approach, based on her ``splitting algorithm'', to compute
    solutions of systems of polynomial equations without the need of
    polynomial factorisations has been proposed by D. Duval; also her
    algorithm should be simplified by a ``generic'' change of coordinates.
    
    The algorithms discussed in this paper are implemented in SCRATCHPAD II.
    
    In the first section we recall some well-known properties of Groebner
    bases and properties on the structure of Groebner bases of
    zero-dimensional ideals from [GT2]; in the second section we recall
    the Groebner basis algorithm for solving systems of algebraic
    equations.
    
    The original results are contained in Sections 3 to 5; in Section 3 we
    take advantage of the obvious fact that density can be controlled by
    performing ``small'' changes of coordinates: we show that such
    approach is possible during a Groebner basis computation, in such a
    way that computations done before a change of coordinates are valid
    also after it; in Section 4 we propose a ``linear algebra'' approach
    to obtain the Groebner basis w.r.t the lexicographical ordering from
    the one w.r.t the total-degree ordering; in Section 5, we present a
    zero-dimensional radical algorithm and show how to apply it to the
    present problem.",

    "Born in Uruguay, Gonnet was first exposed to computers while working
    for IBM in Montevideo as a young man. This led him to a position at
    the university computer center, and in turn to an undergraduate degree
    in computer science in 1973. In 1974, following a military coup, he
    left for graduate studies in computer science at the University of
    Waterloo. Gonnet earned an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in just two and a half
    years, writing a thesis on the analysis of search algorithms under the
    supervision of Alan George. After one year teaching in Rio de Janeiro
    he returned to Waterloo, as a faculty member.
    
    In 1980, Gonnet began work with a group including Morven Gentleman and
    Keith Geddes to produce an efficient interactive computer algebra
    system able to work well on smaller computers: Maple. Gonnet discusses
    in great detail the goals and organization of the Maple project, its
    technical characteristics, the Maple language and kernel, the Maple
    library, sources of funding, the contributions of the various team
    members, and the evolution of the system over time. He compares the
    resulting system to MACSYMA, Mathematica, Reduce, Scratchpad and other
    systems. Gonnet also examines the licensing and distribution of Maple
    and the project’s relations to its users. Maple was initially used for
    teaching purposes within the university, but soon found users in other
    institutions. From 1984, distribution was handled by Watcom, a company
    associated with the university, and 1988, Gonnet and Geddes created a
    new company, Waterloo Maple Software, Inc. to further commercialize
    Maple, which established itself as the leading commercial computer
    algebra system. However, during the mid-1990s the company ran into
    trouble and disagreements with his colleagues caused Gonnet to
    withdraw from managerial involvement. Since then, he feels that Maple
    has lost its battle with Mathematica. Gonnet also discusses Maple’s
    relation to Matlab and its creator, Cleve Moler.
    
    From 1984 onward with Frank Tompa, Tim Bray, and other Waterloo
    colleagues, Gonnet worked on the production of computer software to
    support the creation of the second edition of the Oxford English
    Dictionary. This led to the creation of another startup company, Open
    Text, producing software for the searching and indexing of textual
    information within large corporations. Gonnet explains his role in the
    firm, including his departure and his feeling that it made a strategic
    blunder by not exploiting its early lead in Internet search.
    
    Gonnet continued to work in a number of areas of computer science,
    including analysis of algorithms. In 1990, Gonnet moved from Waterloo
    to ETH in Switzerland. Among his projects since then have been Darwin,
    a bioinformatics system for the manipulation of genetic data, and
    leadership of the OpenMath project to produce a standard
    representation for mathematical objects. He has been involved in
    several further startup companies, including Aruna, a relational
    database company focused on business intelligence applications.",

    "Recently new computer algebra systems such as Scratchpad and Weyl have
    been developed with built in mechanisms for expressing abstract data types.
    These systems are object oriented in that they incorporate multiple
    inheritance and polymorphic types. Davenport and Trager have build much
    of the framework for basic commutative algebra in Scratchpad II 
    utilizing its rich set of abstraction mechanisms. Davenport and Trager
    concentrated on developing factorization algorithms on domains which
    were abstract data types.

    We are taking a similar approach to the development of algorithms for
    computing in graded rings. The purpose of this paper is to develop the
    tools required to compute with polynomials with coefficients in a graded
    ring $R$. We focus on graded rings $R$ which are polynomial rings graded
    by a monoid, and we allow partial orders on the monomials. The ideas
    presented here can be applied to more general graded rings $R$, such as
    associated graded rings to filtered rings, as long as certain computational

    "Let $S := k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in the
    variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ over the field $k$ and 
    $B := \{f_1,\ldots,f_m\} \subset S$
    be a finite system of polynomials. Denote by $I(B)$ the
    ideal generated by these polynomials. One of the major tasks of
    constructive commutative algebra is the derivation of information
    about the structure of 
    \[V(B):=\{a \in K^n : \forall f \in B{\rm\ such\ that\ }f(a)=0\}\]
    the set of common zeroes of the system $B$ over an
    algebraically closed extension $K$ of $k$.  Splitting the system into
    smaller ones, solving them separately, and patching all solutions
    together is often a good guess for a quick solution of even highly
    nontrivial problems. This can be done by several techniques, e.g.,
    characteristic sets, resultants, the Groebner factorizer or some ad
    hoc methods. Of course, such a strategy makes sense only for problems
    that really will split, i.e., for reducible varieties of
    solutions. Surprisingly often, problems coming from 11real life''
    fulfill this condition.  
    
    Among the methods to split polynomial systems into smaller pieces
    probably the Groebner factorizer method attracted the most
    theoretical attention, see Czapor ([4, 5]), Davenport ([6]), Melenk, M
    ̈oller and Neun ([16, 17]) and Gr ̈abe ([13, 14]). General purpose
    Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) are well suited for such an approach,
    since they make available both a (more or less) well tuned
    implementation of the classical Groebner algorithm and an effective
    multivariate polynomial factorizer.
    
    Furthermore it turned out that the Groebner factorizer is not only a
    good heuristic approach for splitting, but its output is also usually
    a collection of almost prime components. Their description allows a
    much deeper understanding of the structure of the set of zeroes
    compared to the result of a sole Groebner basis computation.  
    
    Of course, for special purposes a general CAS as a multipurpose
    mathematical assistant can’t offer the same power as specialized
    software with efficiently implemented and well adapted algorithms and
    data types. For polynomial system solving, such specialized software
    has to implement two algorithmically complex tasks, solving and
    splitting, and until recently none of the specialized systems (as
    e.g., GB, Macaulay, Singular, CoCoA, etc.) did both
    efficiently. Meanwhile, being very efficient computing (classical)
    Groebner bases, development efforts are also directed, not only 
    for performance reasons, towards a better inclusion of factorization
    into such specialized systems.  Needless to remark that it needs some
    skill to force a special system to answer questions and the user will
    probably first try his ``home system'' for an answer. Thus the
    polynomial systems solving facility of the different CAS should behave
    especially well on such polynomial systems that are hard enough not to
    be done by hand, but not really hard to require special efforts. It
    should invoke a convenient interface to get the solutions in a form
    that is (correct and) well suited for further analysis in the familiar
    environment of the given CAS as the personal mathematical assistant.",

    This thesis presents an algorithm for computing (one-sided) limits
    within a symbolic manipulation system. Computing limtis is an
    important facility, as limits are used both by other functions such as
    the definite integrator and to get directly some qualitative
    information about a given function.

    The algorithm we present is very compact, easy to understand and easy
    to implement. It overcomes the cancellation problem other algorithms
    suffer from. These goals were achieved using a uniform method, namely
    by expanding the whole function into a series in terms of its most
    rapidly varying subexpression instead of a recursive bottom up
    expansion of the function. In the latter approach exact error terms
    have to be kept with each approximation in order to resolve the
    cancellation problem, and this may lead to an intermediate expression
    swell. Our algorithm avoids this problem and is thus suited to be
    implemented in a symbolic manipulation system.",

    NAG/IMSL library computation, and (ii) Fortran code generation for
    Argument SubPrograms (ASPs), such as those neede by some NAG/IMSL
    routines. Demonstrations of three links to the NAG library are
    described in [BKRRD]. A description of a link to NAG from Macsyma
    which was mentioned, but not in a sufficiently advanced state to
    demonstrate in early 1991, is given in [BK]. The situation at the end
    of 1991 was that there were links to NAG involving each of Macsyma,
    REDUCE and Mathematica. The links are called Naglink, IRENA and
    InterCall, respectively. The principal authors of IRENA are Mike Dewar
    and Mike Richardson. InterCall is not specific to the NAG library;
    indeed InterCall is used with calls to IMSL and to elsewhere at the
    conference venue, the University of New Mexico.
    
    The two futher links to NAG library treated in this paper are AXIOM2.0
    and genmex/ESC, genmex allows calls to NAG from Matlab. genmex can be
    regarded as similar to InterCall: genmes uses Matlab's mex files in a
    similar way to InterCall's use of Mathematica's MathLink. Again genmex
    is not specific to the NAG library. Mike Dewar is an author both of
    IRENA and the AXIOM2.0 link to the NAG library: see [D] foe discussion

    programming language is not discussed at a higher level than that of
    defining simple procedures and using simple language constructs. 
    However, the Maple data structures are discussed in detail.

    This book is divided into eighteen chapters spanning a variety of
    topics. Starting with an introduction to symbolic computation and
    other similar computer algebra systems, this book covers several
    topics like polynomials and rational functions, series,
    differentiation and integration, differential equations, linear
    algebra, 2-D and 3-D graphics, etc. The applications covered include
    kinematics of the Stanford manipulator, a 3-component model for
    cadmium transfer through the human body, molecular-orbital Hückel
    theory, prolate spheroidal coordinates and Moore-Penrose inverses.
    
    At the end of each chapter, a good number of excercises is given. A

    bases. Firstly, we present the two existing theories of involutive

    {\sl suitable partial divisions}. The thesis is built on this
    generalized approach. Secondly, we treat the question of choosing a
    ``good'' suitable partial division in each iteration of the involutive
    basis algorithm. We devise an efficient and flexible algorithm for
    this purpose, the {\sl Sliced Division} algorithm. During the
    involutive basis algorithm, the Sliced Division algorithm contributes
    to an early detection of the involutive basis property and a
    minimisation of the number of critical elements. Thirdly, we give new
    criteria to avoid unnecessary reductions in an involutive basis
    algorithm. We show that the termination property of an involutive
    basis algorithm which applies our criteria is independent of the
    prolongation selection strategy used during its run. Finally, we
    present an implementation of the algorithm and results of this thesis
    in our software package CALIX."

    "Sophus Lie (1842-1899) pioneered the study of continuous
    transformation groups that leave systems of differential equations
    invariant.  Lie’s work [l-3] brought diverse and ad hoc integration
    methods for solving special classes of differential equations under a
    common conceptual umbrella.  Indeed, Lie’s infinitesimal
    transformation method provides a widely applicable technique to find
    closed form solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODES).
    Standard solution methods for first-order or linear ODES can be
    characterized in terms of symmetries.  Through the group
    classification of ODES, Lie succeeded in identifying all ODES that can
    either be reduced to lower-order ones or be completely integrated via
    group theoretic techniques.  
    
    Applied to partial differential equations (PDEs), Lie’s method [2]
    leads to group-invariant solutions and conservation laws.  Exploiting
    the symmetries of PDEs, new solutions can be derived from known ones,
    and PDEs can be classified into equivalence classes.  Furthermore,
    group-invariant solutions obtained via Lie’s approach may provide
    insight into the physical models themselves, and explicit solutions
    can serve as benchmarks in the design, accuracy testing, and
    comparison of numerical algorithms.
    
    Nowadays, the concept of symmetry plays a key role in the study and
    development of mathematics and physics.  Indeed, the theory of Lie
    groups and Lie algebras is applied to diverse fields of mathematics
    including differential geometry, algebraic topology, bifurcation
    theory, to name a few.  Lie’s original ideas greatly influenced the
    study of physically important systems of differential equations in
    classical and quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, and many
    other applied areas [4-81].
    
    The application of Lie group methods to concrete physical systems
    involves tedious computations.  Even the calculation of the
    continuous symmetry group of a modest system of differential equations
    is prone to errors, if done with pencil and paper.  Computer algebra
    systems (CAS) such as Mathematica, MACSYMA, Maple, REDUCE, AXIOM and
    MuPAD are extremely useful for such computations.  Symbolic packages
    [9-11], written in the language of these GAS, can find the determining
    equations of the Lie symmetry group.  The most sophisticated packages
    then reduce these into an equivalent but more suitable system,
    subsequently solve that system in closed form, and go on to calculate
    the infinitesimal generators that span the Lie algebra of symmetries.
    
    In Section 2, we discuss methods and algorithms used in the
    computation of Lie symmetries.  We address the computation of
    determining systems, their reduction to standard form, solution
    techniques, and the computation of the size of the symmetry group.
    In Section 3, we look beyond Lie-point symmetries, addressing contact
    and generalized symmetries, as well as nonclassical or conditional
    symmetries.  
    
    Section 4 is devoted to a review of modern Lie symmetry
    programs, classified according to the underlying CAS.  The review
    focuses on Lie symmetry software for classical Lie-point symmetries,
    contact (or dynamical), generalized (or Lie-Backlund) symmetries,
    nonclassical (or conditional) symmetries.  Most of these packages were
    written in the last decade.  Researchers interested in details about
    pioneering work should consult [9,10,12].  In Section 5, two examples
    illustrate results that can be obtained with Lie symmetry software.
    In Section 6 we draw some conclusions.  
    
    Lack of space forces us to give only a few key references for the Lie
    symmetry packages.  A comprehensive survey of the literature devoted
    to theoretical as well as computational aspects of Lie symmetries,
    with over 300 references, can be found elsewhere [11].",

  title = {{Symbolic-Numeric Algorithms for Plane Algebraic Curves}},

  school = "RISC Research Institute for Symbolic Computation",
  abstract =
    "In computer algebra, the problem of computing topological invariants
    (i.e. delta-invariant, genus) of a plan complex algebraic curve is
    well-understood if the coefficients of the defining polynomial of the
    curve are exact data (i.e. integer numbers or rational numbers). The
    challenge is to handle this problem if the coefficients are inexact
    (i.e. numerical values).

    In this thesis, we approach the algebraic problem of computing
    invariants of a plane complex algebraic curve defined by a polynomial
    with both exact and inexact data. For the inexact data, we associate a
    positive real number called {\sl tolerance} or {\sl noise}, which
    measures the error level in the coefficients. We deal with an {\sl
    ill-posed} problem in the sense that, tiny changes in the input data
    lead to dramatic modifications in the output solution.

    For handling the ill-posedness of the problem we present a {\sl
    regularization} method, which estimates the invariants of a plane
    complex algebraic curve. Our regularization method consists of a set
    of {\sl symbolic-numeric algorithms} that extract structural
    information on the input curve, and of a {\sl parameter choice rule},
    i.e. a function in the noise level. We first design the following
    symbolic-numeric algorithms for computing the invariants of a plane
    complex algebraic curve:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item we compute the link of each singularity of the curve by numerical
    equation solving
    \item we compute the Alexander polynomial of each link by using
    algorithms from computational geometry (i.e. an adapted version of
    the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm) and combinatorial objects from knot
    theory.
    \item we derive a formula for the delta-invariant and for the genus
    \end{itemize}

    We then prove that the symbolic-numeric algorithms together with the
    parameter choice rule compute approximate solutions, which satisfy the
    {\sl convergence for noisy data property}. Moreover, we perform
    several numerical experiments, which support the validity for the
    convergence statement.

    We implement the designed symbolic-numeric algorithms in a new
    software package called {\sl Genom3ck}, developed using the {\sl Axel}
    free algebraic modeler and the {\sl Mathemagix} free computer algebra
    system. For our purpose, both of these systems provide modern
    graphical capabilities, and algebraic and geometric tools for
    manipulating algebraic curves and surfaces defined by polynomials with
    both exact and inexact data. Together with its main functionality to
    compute the genus, the package {\sl Genom3ck} computes also other type
    of information on a plane complex algebraic curve, such as the
    singularities of the curve in the projective plane and the topological
    type of each singularity.",

    "META/LISP is a general purpose translator writing system for IBM
    System/360 currently running on TSS, CP/CMS, and OS/360. The input
    to the system is a source program which simultaneously describes 
    1) the syntax of some input data to be translated and
    2) algorithms which operate on the input data and a pushdown stack
    to accomplish the desired translation; the output of the system is
    a compiled program for translating that input data. In particular
    when the input data are statements of a higher-level language to
    be translated into assembly language, META/LISP serves as a
    compiler-compiler. META/LISP uses the top-down syntax-directed
    approach which makes the system extremely attractive for the
    design and implementation of experimental languages; using
    META/LISP such compilers are easy to write, easy to check out, and
    - most importantly - easy to modify interactively. The appendices
    which follow a rather complete description of the system including
    a self-description of the META/LISP compiler.",

    how these facilities may be used to produce a conversational

    because of its similarity to APL and LPL, a language resident in
    the SCRATCHPAD system. The essential characteristics of ALPL are
    described by eight syntax rules together with brief examples of
    corresponding ALPL and LISP programs. It is shown how a META/LISP
    program may be easily written to produce a conversation ALPL
    system. The ALPL language is then incrementally extended by
    introducing new notations defined in terms of existing ALPL
    constructs through calls to META/PLUS.",

    "This paper is an abbreviated primer for the language of new
    SCRATCHPAD, a new implementation of SCRATCHPAD which has been under
    design and development by the Computer Algebra Group at the IBM
    Research Center during the past 6 years. The basic design goals of the
    new SCRATCHPAD language and interface to the user are to provde:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a ``typeless'' interactive language suitable for on-line solution
    of mathematical problems by novice users with little or no programming
    required, and
    \item a programming language suitable for the formal description of
    algorithms and algebraic structures which can be compiled into run-time
    efficient object code.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The new SCRATCHPAD language is introduced by 11 keys with each
    successive key introducing an additional capability of the
    language. The language is thus described as a ``concentric'' language
    with each of the 11 levels corresponding to a language subset. These
    levels are more than just a pedagogic device, since they correspond to
    levels at which the system can be effectively used. Level 1 is
    sufficient for naive interactive use; levels 2-8 progressively
    introduce interactive users to capabilities of the language; levels
    9-11 are for system programmers and advanced users. Levesl 2, 4, 6,
    and 7 give users the full power of LISP with a high-level language;
    level 8 introduces ``type declarations;'' level 9 allows polymorphic
    functions to be defined and compiled; levels 10-11 give users an
    Ada-like facility for defining types and packages (those of new
    SCRATCHPAD are dynamically constructable, however). One language is
    used for both interactive and system programming language use,
    although several freedoms such as abbreviation and optional
    type-declarations allowed at top-level are not permitted in system
    code. The interactive language (levels 1-8) is a blend of original
    SCRATCHPAD [GRJY75], some proposed extensions [JENK74], work by Loos
    [LOOS74], SETL [DEWA79], SMP [COWO81], and new ideas; the system
    programming language (levels 1-11) superficially resembles Ada but is
    more similar to CLU [LISK74] in its semantic design.
    
    This presentation of the language in this paper omits many details to
    be covered in the SCRATCHPAD System Programming Manual [SCRA84] and an
    expanded version of this paper will serve as a primer for SCRATCHPAD
    users [JESU84].",

    "The Scratchpad II system represents a new generation of systems for
    doing symbolic mathematics, based on modern algebra and abstract data
    types. A large number of facilities are provided, for example:
    symbolic integration, ``infinite'' power series, differential operators,
    Cartesian tensors, and solution of nonlinear systems. Scratchpad II
    has been designed from the outset to be extendible. The system
    introduces a new data abstraction notion, the ``category,'' to express
    intricate interrelationships between data types. The result design
    permits the compilation of algorithms described in their most natural
    mathematical setting. The use of categories guarantees user defined
    types and packages are compatible with each other and with built in
    facilities. This system provides a single high‐level language with an
    intepreter and compiler. The language can be used by the naive user
    for convenient interactive mathematics calculations and by the
    advanced user for the efficient implementation of
    algorithms. Scratchpad II is built on Lisp/VM and runs on IBM/370
    class mainframes. An implementation of the system on the RT/PC is
    expected soon.",

    "Scratchpad [GrJe71] was a computer algebra system developed in the
    early 1970s.  Like M\&M (Maple [CGG91ab] and Mathematical [W01S92]) and
    other systems today, Scratchpad had one principal representation for
    mathematical formulae based on ``expression trees''.  Its user interface
    design was based on a pattern-matching paradigm with infinite rewrite-
    rule semantics, providing what we believe to be the most natural
    paradigm for interactive symbolic problem solving.  Like M\&M, however,
    user programs were interpreted, often resulting in poor performance
    relative to similar facilities coded in standard programming languages
    such as FORTRAN and C.  
    
    Scratchpad development stopped in 1976 giving way to a new system
    design ([JenR79], [JeTr81]) that evolved into AXIOM [JeSu92].
    AXIOM has a strongly-typed programming language for building a library
    of parameterized types and algorithms, and a type-inferencing
    interpreter that accesses the library and can build any of an infinite
    number of types for interactive use.
    
    We suggest that the addition of an expression tree type to AXIOM can
    allow users to operate with the same freedom and convenience of
    untyped systems without giving up the expressive power and run-time
    efficiency provided by the type system.  We also present a design that
    supports a multiplicity of programming styles, from the Scratchpad
    pattern-matching paradigm to functional programming to more
    conventional procedural programming.  The resulting design seems to us
    to combine the best features of Scratchpad with current AXIOM and to
    offer a most attractive, flexible, and user-friendly environment for
    interactive problem solving.
    
    Section 2 is a discussion of design issues contrasting AXIOM with
    other symbolic systems.  Sections 3 and 4 is an assessment of AXIOM’s
    current design for building libraries and interactive use.  Section 5
    describes a new interface design for AXIOM, its resulting paradigms,
    and its underlying semantic model.  Section 6 compares this work with
    others.",

    "The problem of efficiently evaluating special functions to high
    precision has been considered by numerous authors. Important tools
    used for this purpose include algorithms for evaluation of linearly
    recurrent sequences, and algorithms for power series arithmetic.

    In this work, we give new baby-step, giant-step algorithms for
    evaluation of linearly recurrent sequences involving an expensive
    parameter (such as a high-precision real number) and for computing
    compositional inverses of power series. Our algorithms do not have the
    best asymptotic complexity, but they are faster than previous
    algorithms in practice over a large input range.

    Using a combination of techniques, we also obtain efficient new
    algorithms for numerically evaluating the gamma function $\Gamma(z)$
    and the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$, or Taylor series
    expansions of those functions, with rigorous error bounds. Our methods
    achieve softly optimal complexity when computing a large number of
    derivatives to proportionally high precision.

    Finally, we show that isolated values of the integer partition
    function $p(n)$ can be computed rigorously with softly optimal
    complexity by means of the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula and
    careful numerical evaluation.

    We provide open source implementations which run significantly faster
    than previous published software. The implementations are used for
    record computations of the partition function, including the
    tabulation of several billion Ramanujan-type congruences, and of
    Taylor series associated with the Reimann zeta function.",

    readily derived via the classical geometry of stationary

    $S$ is considered in a natural orthonormal triad formulation. In one case,
    in a motion in which the Gaussian curvature of $S$ remains constant in

    its origin in the description of wave propagation in an anharmonic
    crystal. In a second case, wherein the Gaussian curvature is allowed

    in connection with the purely normal propagation of a pseudospherical
    surface. This is linked to triply orthogonal coordinate systems of
    Bianchi type. The generalised Weingarten system incorporates an

    CAS/$\pi$ is to allow a wide range of runtime recon gurations and
    extensions. For instance, it is possible to add new tools to a running
    system, to modify connections between working tools, to extend the set
    of graphic symbols managed by the formula editor, to design new high
    level editing commands based on the syntax or semantics of
    mathematical formulas, to customize and extend the menu-button based
    user interface, etc. More generally, CAS/$\pi$ can be seen equally as
    a powerful system-independent graphic user interface enabling
    inter-systems communications, a toolkit to allow fast development of
    custom-made scientific software environments, or a very convenient
    framework for experimenting with computer algebra systems protocols
    and man-machine interfaces.",

    (axioms for an equational theory and a basis for a polynomial
    ideal, respectively) which is transformed to a very special
    specification of this algebraic structure (a complete rewrite rule

    This special specification allows to decide many problems concerning 
    the given algebraic structure. Moreover, both algorithms achieve
    their goals by employing the same basic concepts: formation of
    critical pairs and completion.

    Although the two methods are obviously related, the exact nature

    "Mechanized reasoning systems and computer algebra systems have
    different objectives. Their integration is highly desirable, since
    formal proofs often involve both of the two different tasks proving
    and calculating. Even more important, proof and computation are often
    interwoven and not easily separable.

    In this article, we advocate an integration of computer algebra into
    mechanized reasoning systems at the proof plan level. This approach
    allows us to view the computer algebra algorithms as methods, that is,
    declarative representations of the problem-solving knowledge specific
    to a certain mathematical domain. Automation can be achieved in many
    cases by searching for a hierarchic proof plan at the method level by
    using suitable domain-specific control knowledge about the
    mathematical algorithms. In other words, the uniform framework of
    proof planning allows us to solve a large class of problems that are
    not automatically solvable by separate systems.

    Our approach also gives an answer to the correctness problems inherent
    in such an integration. We advocate an approach where the computer
    algebra system produces high-level protocol information that can be
    processed by an interface to derive proof plans. Such a proof plan in
    turn can be expanded to proofs at different levels of abstraction, so
    the approach is well suited for producing a high-level verbalized
    explication as well as for a low-level, machine-checkable,
    calculus-level proof. We present an implementation of our ideas and
    exemplify them using an automatically solved example.",

    "Orthogonal polynomials have a long history, and are still important
    objects of consideration in mathematical research as well as in
    applications in Mathematical Physics, Chemistry, and
    Engineering. Quite a lot is known about them. Particularly well-known
    are differential equations, recurrence equations, Rodrigues formulas,
    generating functions and hypergeometric representations for the
    classical systems of Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite which can be found
    in mathematical dictionaries. Less well-known are the corresponding
    representations for the classical discrete systems of Hahn,
    Krawtchouk, Meixner and Charlier, as well as addition theorems,
    connection relations between different systems and other identities
    for these and other systems of orthogonal polynomials. The ongoing
    research in this still very active subject of mathematics expands the
    knowledge database about orthogonal polynomials continuously. In the
    last few decades the classical families have been extended to a rather
    large collection of polynomial systems, the so-called Askey-Wilson
    scheme, and they have been generalized in other ways as well.

    Recently new algorithmic approaches have been discovered to compute
    differential, recurrence and similar equations from series or integral
    representations. These methods turn out to be quite useful to prove or
    detect identities for orthogonal polynomial systems. Further
    algorithms to detect connection coefficients or to identify polynomial
    systems from given recurrence equations have been developed. Although
    some algorithmic methods had been known already in the last century,
    their use was rather limited due to the immense amount of
    calculations. Only the existence and distribution of computer algebra
    systems makes their use simple and useful for everybody.

    In this plenary lecture an overview is given of how algorithmic
    methods implemented in computer algebra systems can be used to prove
    identities about and to detect new knowledge for orthogonal
    polynomials and other hypergeometric type special functions.
    Implementations for this type of algorithms exist in Maple,
    Mathematica and REDUCE, and maybe also in other computer algebra
    systems. Online demonstrations will be given using Maple V.5.",

    computer algebra in an area not usually associated with that
    subject. Comparison of the complexes produced by the method discussed
    here with those produced by other methods shows that the algorithm
    generalizes several other approaches, [GL], [GLS1], [GLS2], [BL], [BL2].  
    
    This is an expository note which is intended to help make homological
    perturbation theory more accesible and to encourage wider use of
    Computer Algebra in mathematical research.
    
    The class of objects presented here -- Finitely generated torsion-free
    nilpotent groups (of arbitrary nilpotency class) -- are given because
    of their simplicity. The examples point to the general phenomena that
    are to be expected when trying to derive complexes smaller than
    ``standard complexes'' in other homological contexts. The complexes
    produced are generally {\sl much} smaller than the bar construction, but
    larger than a {\sl minimal resolution}.",

  abstract =
    "The quantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) has roots in statistical
    mechanics and the inverse scattering method and leads to a natural
    construction of a bialgebra. It turns out to have important
    connections with knot theory and invariants of 3-manifolds. There are
    now available many reference books to quantum groups and these various
    applications. The book under review develops the algebraic
    underpinning and theory of the QYBE, including the constant form and
    the one and two parameter forms.
    
    We give a brief description of the chapters. Chapter 1 (together with
    an Appendix) gives the algebraic preliminaries involving coalgebras,
    bialgebras, Hopf algebras, modules and comodules. Chapter 2 introduces
    the various forms of the QYBE, and the basic algebraic structures
    associated to them, including Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtadzhan (FRT)
    construction. Chapter 3 explores various categorical settings for the
    constant form of the QYBE, the most basic being the category of left
    QYB modules over a bialgebra and the notion of algebras, coalgebras,
    etc. in this category. Chapter 4 develops universal mapping properties
    of the FRT construction and its reduced version, and the authors
    investigate when the reduced FRT construction leads to a pointed
    bialgebra or a pointed Hopf algebra. Chapter 5 develops the quantum
    groups associated to $SL(2)$, i.e., the quantum universal enveloping
    algebra, and the quantum function algebra. Chapter 6 introduces
    quasitriangular Hopf algebras, and discusses how the
    finite-dimensional ones give rise to solutions of the QYBE through
    their representation theory. The most important example is the
    Drinfeld double of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The authors note
    (through an exercise!) that every finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is
    the reduced FRT construction of some solution to the QYBE. Chapter 7
    introduces coquasitriangular bialgebras, the most important being the
    FRT and the reduced FRT constructions. There are some generalizations
    here to the one-parameter form of the QYBE. Chapter 8 uses all the
    previously developed techniques to find solutions of the QYBE in
    certain cases, including the one-parameter form. Some of these were
    discovered by computer algebra methods. The final chapter 9 gives a
    brief discussion of certain categorical constructions and the QYBE is
    certain fairly abstract categories, motivated by the fact that the FRT
    construction is a coend.
    
    This book fills an important niche in the literature involving the
    QYBE by highlighting the algebraic aspects and applications. Although
    this is basically a reference book, it includes so many important
    parts of the study of Hopf algebras that it could be used as a
    textbook for a certain type of course on Hopf algebras and quantum
    groups, and certainly as supplementary reading material for such a
    course. There are frequent exercises which would be useful for such
    purposes. Besides being a basic source book, the authors include some
    new results and some novel approaches to earlier results. All this
    makes this book a most welcome addition to the quantum group
    literature.",

    best done using computer-aided symbolic computation (SC). In addition,

    Algebraic programming in APS relies on special data structures, the
    so-called graph terms, which permit using diverse data and knowledge
    representations in relevant application domains. In the language
    APLAN, graph terms are described by expressions or systems of
    expressions of a many-sorted algebra of data. They may represent both
    objects of the application domain and reasoning about these
    objects. The option of setting an arbitrary interpretation of the
    operations in the algebra of data makes it possible to use APS as a
    basis for various extensions.
    
    Symbolic computation systems such as Scratchpad/AXIOM have acquired
    special importance. They provide various possibilities of manipulating
    typed mathematical objects, including objects of complex hierarchical
    structure. This is a natural requirement when working with algebraic
    objects. In particular, the properties of many algebraic structures
    (such as groups, rings, fields, etc.) are naturally
    hierarchical-modular.
    
    The Institute of Cybernetics and the Kherson Teachers’ College have
    developed an instruction-oriented computer algebra system AIST. The
    AIST kernel is a hierarchical structure of mathematical concepts
    described in the APS language. However, construction of new
    applications on the basis of this hierarchical structure has proved
    difficult. The system kernel can be made more flexible by providing
    tools for flexible description of hierarchical structures of
    mathematical concepts.
    
    In this article, we describe an extension of the language APLAN, which
    provides tools for the object-oriented style of programming. This is
    one of the possible ways of introducing types in APS. The
    object-oriented technology also can be used to develop a hierarchical
    system of mathematical objects.",

    "Exact symbolic computation with polynomials and matrices over
    polynomial rings has wide applicability to many fields [Hereman96,
    Lewis99]. By ``exact symbolic'', we mean computation with polynomials
    whose coefficients are integers (of any size), rational numbers, or
    from finite fields, as opposed to coefficients that are ``floats'' of a
    certain precision. Such computation is part of most computer algebra
    (CA) systems. Over the last dozen years, several large CA systems have
    become widely available, such as Axiom, Derive, Macsyma, Maple,
    Mathematica and Reduce. They tend to have great breadth, be produced
    by profit-making companies, and be relatively expensive, at least for
    a full blown non-student version. However, most if not all of these
    systems have difficulty computing with the polynomials and matrices
    that arise in actual research. Real problems tend to produce large
    polynomials and large matrices that the general CA systems cannot
    handle [Lewis99].
    
    In the last few years, several smaller CA systems focused on
    polynomials have been produced at universities by individual
    researchers or small teams. They run on Macs, PCs and workstations.
    They are freeware or shareware. Several claim to be much more
    efficient than the large systems at exact polynomial computations. The
    list of these systems includes CoCoA, Fermat, MuPAD, Pari-Gp and
    Singular [CoCoA, Fermat, MuPAD, Pari-Gp, Singular].
    
    In this paper, we compare these small systems to each other and to two
    of the large systems (Magma and Maple) on a set of problems involving
    exact symbolic computation with polynomials and matrices. The problems
    here involve:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the ground rings $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}/p$ 
    and other finite fields
    \item basic arithmetic of polynomials over the ground ring
    \item basic arithmetic of rational functions over the ground ring
    \item polynomial evaluation (substitution)
    \item matrix normal form
    \item determinants and characteristic polynomial
    \item GCDs of multivariate polynomial

    "The Heuristic Polynomial GCD procedure (GCDHEU) is used by the Maple
    computer algebra system, but not other. Because Maple has an
    especially efficient kernel that provides fast integer arithmetic, but
    a relatively slower interpreter for non-kernel code, the GCDHEU
    routine is especially effective in that it moves much of the
    computation into ``bignum'' arithmetic and hence executes primarily in
    the kernel.
    
    We speculated that in other computer algebra systems an implementation
    GCDHEU would not be advantageous. In particular, if {\sl all} the
    system code is compiled to run at ``full speed'' in a (presumably more
    bulky) kernel that is entirely written in C or compiled Lisp, then
    there would seem to be no point in recasting the polynomial gcd
    problem into a bignum GCD problem. Manipulating polynomials that are
    vectors of coefficients would seem to be equivalent computationally to
    manipulating vectors of big digits.
    
    Yet our evidence suggests that one can take advantage of the GCDHEU in
    a Lisp system as well. Given a good implementation of bignums, for
    most small problems and many large ones, a substantial speedup can be
    obtained by the appropriate choice of GCD algorithm, including often
    enought, the GCDHEU approach. Another major winner seem to be the
    subresultant polynomial remainder sequence algorithm. Because more
    sophisticated sparse algorithms are relatively slow on small problems
    and only occasionally emerge as superior (on larger problems) it seems
    the choice of a fast GCD algorithm is tricky.",

    Triangular decompositions are a highly promising technique with the

    We propose asymptotically fast algorithms for the core operati ons on

    We present a fundamental software library for polynomial arithmetic in

    on triangular decompositions. We investigate strategies for the
    integration of this library in high-level programming environments
    where triangular decompositions are usually implemented.

    We obtain a high performance library combining highly optimized C

    "The ultimate objective of this paper is to create a stepping stone to
    the development of new quantum algorithms. The strategy chosen is to
    begin by focusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup
    algorithms, i.e., the class of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon
    genre. Our strategy is to make this class of algorithms as
    mathematically transparent as possible. By the phrase ``mathematically
    transparent'' we mean to expose, to bring to the surface, and to make
    explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently and
    fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create
    symbolic abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous
    to the those symbolic algorithms found within such software packages
    as Axiom, Cayley, Maple, Mathematica, and Magma.

    As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different
    generalizations of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian
    groups of finite rank. We refer to these algorithms as wandering (or
    vintage $\mathbb{Z}_Q$) Shor algorithms. They are essentially quantum
    algorithms on free abelian groups of finite rank $n$ which, with each
    iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand $\mathbb{Z}$ of
    the group and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm
    to produce a random character of the “approximating” finite group
    $\widetilde{A} = \mathbb{Z}_Q$, called the group probe. These
    characters are then in turn used to find either the order $P$ of a
    maximal cyclic subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_P$ of the hidden quotient group
    $H_{\varphi}$, or the entire hidden quotient group $H_{\varphi}$. An
    integral part of these wandering quantum algorithms is the selection
    of a very special random transversal $t_{\mu}:\widetilde{A}\rightarrow A$,
    which we refer to as a Shor transversal. The algorithmic time
    complexity of the first of these wandering Shor algorithms is found to
    be $O(n^2({rm lg\ } Q)^3 ({\rm lg\ }{\rm lg\ } Q)^{n+1})$.",

    "The term ``Picard iteration'' occurs two places in undergraduate
    mathematics. In numerical analysis it is used when discussing fixed
    point iteration for finding a numerical approximation to the equation
    $s=g(x)$. In differential equations, Picard iteration is a
    constructive procedure for establishing the existence of a solution to
    a differential equation $y^{\prime} = f(x,y)$.
    
    The first type of Picard iteration uses computations to generate a
    sequence of numbers which converges to a solution. We will not present
    this application, but mention that it involves the traditional role of
    the computer as a ``number cruncher.''
    
    The second application of Picard iteration illustrates how to use a
    computer to generate a sequence of functions which converges to a
    solution. The purpose of this article is to show the step by step
    process in translating mathematical theory into the symbolic
    manipulation setting. Systems such as MACSYM, ALTRAN, REDUCE, SMP,

    needed algebraic background. The book is self-contained and the proofs
    are given with many details.

    does not cover the many improvements that appeared in the last 7 years
    about for example the computation of Groebner basis, polynomial
    solving, multivariate resultants and algorithms in real
    algebra. Choices had to be made to keep the content of a reasonable

    "In 1980 Schwartz gave a fast {\sl probabilistic} method which tests
    if a matrix of polynomials of $\mathbb{Z}$ is singular or not. The
    method is based on the idea of {\sl signature functions} which are
    mappings of mathematical expressions into finite rings. In Schwartz's
    paper, they were polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ into GF($p$). Because
    computation in GF($p$) is very fast compared with computing with
    polynomials, Schwartz's method yields an enormous speedup both in
    theory and in practice. Therefore it is desirable to extend the class
    of expressions for which we can find effective signature functions. In
    the mid 80's Gonnet extended the class of expressions, for which
    signature functions can be found, to include a restricted class of
    elementary functions and integer roots. In this paper we present and
    compare methods for constructing signature functions for expressions

    "A common way of implementing multivariate polynomial multiplication
    and division is to represent polynomials as linked lists of terms
    sorted in a term ordering and to use repeated merging. This results in
    poor performance on large sparse polynomials.

    In this paper we use an auxiliary heap of pointers to reduce the
    number of monomial comparisons in the worst case while keeping the
    overall storage linear. We give two variations. In the first, the size
    of the heap is bounded by the number of terms in the quotient(s). In
    the second, which is new, the size is bounded by the number of terms
    in the divisor(s).

    We use dynamic arrays of terms rather than linked lists to reduce
    storage allocations and indirect memory references. We pack monomials
    in the array to reduce storage and to speed up monomial
    comparisons. We give a new packing for the graded reverse
    lexicographical ordering.

    We have implemented the heap algorithms in C with an interface to
    Maple. For comparison we have also implemented Yan’s ``geobuckets'' data
    structure. Our timings demonstrate that heaps of pointers are
    comparable in speed with geobuckets but use significantly less

    "Cryptography has become indispensable in areas such as e-commerce,
    the legal safe-guarding of medical records, and secure electronic
    communication. Hence, it is incumbent upon software engineers to
    understand the concepts and techniques underlying the cryptosystems
    that they implement. An educator needs to consider which topics to
    cover in a course on cryptography as well as how to present the
    concepts and techniques to be covered in the course. This thesis
    contributes to the field of cryptography pedagogy by discussing and
    implementing small-scale cryptosystems whose encryption and
    decryption processes can be stepped through by hand. Our
    implementation has been accepted and integrated into the code base of
    the computer algebra system Sage. As Sage is free and open source,
    students and educators of cryptology need not worry about paying
    license fees in order to use Sage, but can instead concentrate on
    exploring cryptography using Sage’s built-in support for cryptography.",

    We examine what is required to use Aldor libraries to extend Maple in
    an effective and natural way. Since the computational models of Maple
    and Aldor differ significantly, new run-time code must implement a
    non-trivial semantic correspondence. Our solution allows Aldor
    functions to run tightly coupled to the Maple environment, able to
    directly and efficiently manipulate Maple data objects. We call the

    where $f_i$ is (for $i=1,\ldots,m$) a polynomial in $2n$ variables
    $(X,P)=(X_1,\ldots,X_n,P_1,\ldots,P_n)$. This covers in particular
    quasilinear systems, often encountered in applications and defined
    by polynomials $f_i$ in which the total degree in the variables $P$
    is at most one. The approach is close to the geometrical framework
    of Rabier and Rheinboldt, profitting from the polynomial form of
    the system.

    The authors develop an algorithm for the symbolic computation of
    the set of consistent initial values via ideal-theoretic results; 
    this is based on a stationary algebraic process of ``prolongation'',
    together with the notions of the completion of a given ideal and the
    algebraic index of the system, defined as the number of steps taken
    by the process to stabilize. Over- and under-determined systems are

    manipulations are performed using different instantiations of

    We use these algorithms to compute polynomial gcds and Bezout

    "Both Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) and dynamic geometry systems
    (DGSs) have reached a high level of development. Some CASs (like Maple
    or Derive) include specific and powerful packages devoted to Euclidean
    geometry, but CASs have incorporated neither mouse drawing
    capabilities nor dynamic capabilities. Meanwhile, the well-known DGSs
    do not provide algebraic facilities.

    Maple’s and Derive’s paramGeo packages and the DGS-CAS translator (all
    freely available from the authors) make it possible to draw a
    geometric configuration with the mouse (using The Geometer’s Sketchpad
    3 or 4) and to obtain the coordinates, equations, etc., of the drawn
    configuration in Maple’s or Derive’s syntax. To obtain complicated
    formulae, coordinates of points or equations of loci, to perform
    automatic theorem proving and to perform automatic discovery directly
    from sketches are examples of straightforward applications. Moreover,
    this strategy could be adapted to other CASs and DGSs.

    This work clearly has a didactic application in geometric problems
    exploration. Nevertheless, its main interest is to provide a
    convenient time-saving way to introduce data when dealing with rule

    "This paper presents a type system for support of subtypes,
    parameterized types with sharing and categories in a computer algebra
    environment. By modeling representation of instances in terms of
    existential types, we obtain a simplified model, and build a basis for
    defining subtyping among algebraic domains. The inheritance at
    category level has been formalized; this allows the automatic
    inference of type classes. By means of type classes and existential
    types we construct subtype relations without involving coercions. A
    type sharing mechanism works in parallel and allows the consistent
    extension and combination of domains. The expressiveness of the system
    is further increased by viewing domain types as special case of
    package types, forming weak and strong sums respectively. The
    introduced system, although awkward at first sight, is simpler than
    other proposed systems for computer algebra without including some of
    their problems. The system can be further extended in other to support
    more constructs and increase its flexibility.",

    An introduction to the formal theory of partial differential equations
    is given emphasizing the properties of involutive symbols and
    equations.  An algorithm to complete any differential equation to an

    values for the number of arbitrary functions in its general solution
    are determined. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for analytic
    equations is proven.  Applications of these results include an
    analysis of symmetry and reduction methods and a study of gauge
    systems. It is show that the Dirac algorithm for systems with
    constraints is closely related to the completion of the equation of
    motion to an involutive equation. Specific examples treated comprise
    the Yang-Mills Equations, Einstein Equations, complete and Jacobian
    systems, and some special models in two and three dimensions. To
    facilitate the involved tedious computations an environment for

    "In this article, a brief exposition of a method for finding first
    integrals for first order multinomial autonomous systems (FOMAS) of
    ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients will be
    given. The method is a simplified as well as a redesigned version
    based on a paper of Goldman (1987). We shall see how it can be applied
    to FOMAS with parametric coefficients. The algorithm is currently
    being implemented by the author, using the SCRATCHPAD II computer
    algebra language and system at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
    
    FOMAS occur and are of interest in many disciplines and their first
    integrals (or trajectories of motion) are generally difficult to
    find. Examples of FOMAS are too numerous to list, some well-known ones
    are the Riccati equation, the Lotka-Volterra equations for competing
    populations, Selkov's model for chemical reactions, the Lorenz system
    of the Rayleigh-Bernard problem, and Hamiltonian systems (where the
    Hamiltonian is a sum of monomial terms with constant coefficients).
    
    Let $Y=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ be $n$ functions depending on the variable
    $\tau$. A monomial in $Y$ is a product of the form $y_1^{k_1}\cdots
    y_n^{k_n}$, where $k_1,\ldots,k_n$ are constants. If
    $K=(k_1,\ldots,k_n)$, we shall denote the monomial in $Y$ by $Y^K$,
    and $K$ is called the exponent vector for the monomial. By convention,
    exponent vectors are column vectors, but whenever convenient, we shall
    write exponent vectors as row vectors. We say that $Y$ satisfies a
    first-order multinomial autonomous system (FOMAS) if for each $i$, $1
    \le i \le n$, $y_i$ satisfies a first order differential equation of
    the form:
    \[y_i^{\prime} = f_i(Y)\quad\quad\quad(1)\]
    where $f_i$ is a linear combination of monomials in $Y$ with coefficients
    which may be either constants or parametric constants. For example, the
    Lotka-Volterra equations for three competing species considered by
    Schwarz and Steeb (1984), form a FOMAS:
    \[x_1^{\prime}=x_1(1+ax_2+bx_3)\]
    \[x_2^{\prime}=x_2(1-ax_1+bx_3)\]
    \[x_3^{\prime}=x_3(1-bx_1-cx_2)\]
    When the exponent vectors occuring in $f_i$ are all non-negative integers,
    as in the example above, a FOMAS reduces to a polynomial autonomous
    system (FOPAS).
    
    A computer program was developed by Schwarz (1986) to compute the
    first integrals of FOPAS's which are themselves polynomials in
    $y_1,\ldots,y_n$. Schwarz's algorithm literally takes a general
    polynomial of a fixed degree $d$ in $n$ variables and substitutes it
    into (1). This method does not work well on a FOMAS, because in a
    FOMAS, the exponent vectors need not have integral components. Also,
    it wll not find integrals with exponent vectors that involve
    fractional or irrational numbers.
    
    Goldman (1987) proved a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient
    conditions for the existence of a multinomial first integral for
    FOMAS. The proof also contained the outline of an algorithm for
    finding such integrals. In Goldman's paper, he introduced the notion
    of an integral array, which is a certain matrix satisfying some 10
    conditions. He gave a few hints and several examples but did not
    elaborate on how such an integral array can be found in general
    (except in the case $q=2$). Assuming such an array is found, he can
    compute the integral, in most cases, by solving systems of linear
    equations, or at worse in certain cases, by solving a system of
    algebraic equations. It was not clear when algebraic conditions are
    necessary.
    
    In this brief exposition, Goldman's method will be expanded to a
    complete algorithm with a new simplified notation. The integral arrays
    are replaced by addition schemes (which is equivalent to integral
    arrays with some conditions removed). The generation of addition
    schemes is a combinatorial problem unrelated, in a sense, to
    FOMAS. When the first integral is a polynomial, the additioin scheme
    is trivial to compute. We shall now begin by explaining some details
    of this theory.",

    "Reusing code from software libraries can reduce the time and effort
    to construct software systems and also enable the development of
    larger systems. However, the benefits that come from the use of
    software libraries may not be realized due to limitations in the way
    that traditional software libraries are constructed. Libraries come
    equipped with application programming interfaces (API) that help
    enforce the correct use of the abstraction in those libraries. Writing
    new components and adapting existing ones to conform to library APIs
    may require substantial amounts of ``glue'' code that potentially
    affects software's efficiency, robustness, and ease-of-maintenance. 
    If, as a result, the idea of reusing functionality from a software 
    library is rejected, no benefits of reuse will be realized.
    
    This dissertation explores and develops techniques that support the
    construction of software libraries with abstraction layers that do not
    impede efficiency. In many situations, glue code can be expected to
    have very low (or zero) performance overhead. In particular, we
    describe advances in the design and development of active libraries --
    software libraries that take an active role in the compilation of the
    user's code. Common to the presented techniques is that they may
    ``break'' a library API (in a controlled manner) to adapt the
    functionality of the library for a particular use case.
    
    The concrete contributions of this dissertation are: a library API
    that supports iterator selection in the Standard Template Library,
    allowing generic algorithms to find the most suitable traversal
    through a container, allowing (in one case) a 30-fold improvement in
    performance; the development of techniques, idioms, and best practices
    for {\tt concepts} and {\tt concept\_maps} in C++, allowing the
    construction of algorithms for one domain entirely in terms of
    formalisms from a second domain; the construction of generic
    algorithms for algorithmic differentiation, implemented as an active
    library in Spad, language of the Open Axiom computer algebra system,
    allowing algorithmic differentiation to be applied to the appropriate
    mathematical object and not just concrete data-types; and the
    description of a static analysis framework to describe the generic
    programming notion of local specialization with Spad, allowing more
    sophisticated (value-based) control over algorithm selection and
    specialization in categories and domains.
    
    We will find that active libraries simultaneously increase the
    expressivity of the underlying language and the performance of
    software using those libraries",

    "The introduction of first-class type classes in the Coq system calls
    for a re-examination of the basic interfaces used for mathematical
    formalisation in type theory. We present a new set of type classes for
    mathematics and take full advantage of their unique features to make
    practical a particularly flexible approach that was formerly thought
    to be infeasible. Thus, we address traditional proof engineering
    challenges as well as new ones resulting from our ambition to build
    upon this development a library of constructive analysis in which any
    abstraction penalties inhibiting efficient computation are reduced to
    a minimum.

    The basis of our development consists of type classes representing a
    standard algebraic hierarchy, as well as portions of category theory
    and universal algebra. On this foundation, we build a set of
    mathematically sound abstract interfaces for different kinds of
    numbers, succinctly expressed using categorical language and universal
    algebra constructions.

    Strategic use of type classes lets us support these high-level
    theory-friendly definitions, while still enabling efficient
    implementations unhindered by gratuitous indirection, conversion or
    projection.

    Algebra thrives on the interplay between syntax and semantics. The
    Prolog-like abilities of type class instance resolution allow us to
    conveniently define a quote function, thus facilitating the use of

    "Based on our experiences with IRENA, we decided to use generic
    inter-process communication tools for the link to AXIOM. This has the
    added advantage that we can operate across a network. The main
    technique we use is the {\sl Remote Procedure Call} (RPC) [Sun
    Microsystems Inc., 1988] which allows us to interact with a server on
    another machine (or on the local machine). RPC takes care of
    differences in data representation (e.g. the byte-order of floating
    point numbers) on different architectures.
    
    AXIOM is a multi-process package. Normally when a user starts up the
    system they start up the various components which then interact via
    standard socket operations. If they are using the line, they start up
    a new process: the NAG Manager (NAGMAN for short). Additionally, there
    will be a NAG daemon (NAGD) running on any machine on which the user
    may wish to execute NAG routines (which could include the local
    host). NAGMAN commnicates with the running AXIOM system via a socket
    down which is transmitted the details of and data for the particular
    routine to be called. NAGMAN calls a NAGD on another machine via RPC
    and eventually returns the results to AXIOM.
    
    NAGD consists of the server program, and a set of stub codes designed
    to call individual NAG routines. It is, in effect, a remotely-callable
    version of the NAG library. There is no reason why AXIOM should be the
    only system to use it, and indeed there are plans to incorporate the
    ability to call NAGD into other systems.
    
    An ASP is treated just like any other piece of data by the AXIOM-NAG
    link. The source code is passed to NAGD and compiled. (There are
    various optimisations to prevent the same code being compiled multiple
    times, but the details needn't concern us here.) This compiled code is
    linked with the NAG Library to make the executable. Thus if a user
    calls the same NAG routine with different ASPs the routine will be
    relinked each time.
    
    It would be nice if this were not necessary. The authors of the link
    considered two other possibilities:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Have AXIOM simulate the ASPs, so that the NAG Library would call
    back to AXIOM when it wanted to call an ASP. This was rejected as
    being far too slow across a network.
    \item Give NAGD the ability to interpret AXIOM or Fortran code. Thus
    the NAG routine would call a function which would evaluate a
    representation of an ASP to get the required values. This may happen
    in the future if data interchange mechanisms between systems are
    stanardised, but was rejected for the time being since such a system
    would have to be tailored to match each Fortran compiler that NAGD used.
    \end{itemize}
    
    By transmitting source code for ASPs we allow the remote Fortran
    compiler to take care of low-level portability problems.
    
    Both IRENA and the AXIOM-NAG Link make using the NAG Library easier in
    a functional kind of way. They present a more natural, interactive
    interface and, what is more, they cut out some of the tedium of
    writing code by generating values for some parameters (array
    dimensions etc.) and computing derivatives and
    jacobians. Unfortunately the user still has to choose which algorithm
    to use, and tuen the control parameters to give a result of the
    required accuracy.
    
    This is not a trivial task. The NAG Library has some thirty quadrature
    routines, and maby forty top-level ODE-solving routines. The criteria
    for selecting a routine can include features of the problem such as
    whether a function is continuous, or they can include requrements from
    the user such as whether speed or accuracy is important. The user
    should also think carefully about whether the problem is being
    presentin in the best way: perhaps an integral can be solved more
    easily if the range of integration is split into several pieces for
    example.
    
    Many users of numerical software would like to be presented with a
    ``black box'' for solving a given class of problems. In practice many
    users will always try solving a problem with the ``simplest'' method
    first, in the hope that they can escape having to think seriously
    about their problem! This is not always a bad idea anyway, since the
    feedback from the routine can help determine a better technique
    (e.g. by identifying the regions where problems occur).
    
    We contend that computer algebra has an important role to play in this
    area. The ability of algebra systems to analyse the symbolic features
    of a problem make them idea {\sl agents} for knowledge-based (or
    expert) systems to use in selecting routines. Their ability (via IRENA
    or AXIOM-NAG) to drive the numerical codes is a bonus.",

    on $K$) of $PGL(n+1,q)$, the $K$ is cyclic.

    This article investigates cyclic complete $k$-caps in
    $PG(3,q)$. Namely, the different types of complete $k$-caps $K$ in
    $PG(3,q)$ stabilized by a cyclic projective group $G$ of order $k$,
    acting regularly on the points of $K$, are determined. We show that in
    $PG(3,q)$, $q$ even, the elliptic quadric is the only cyclic complete
    $k$-cap. For $q$ odd, it is shown that besides the elliptic quadric,
    there also exist cyclic $k$-caps containing $k/2$ points of two
    disjoint elliptic quadrics or two disjoint hyperbolic quadrics and
    that there exist cyclic $k$-caps stabilized by a transitive cyclic
    group $G$ fixed precisely one point and one plane of

    (1994; Zbl 0819.26003)] have greatly faciliated mathematical
    experiments and have thus become popular tools for the modern
    mathematician. It is a pity that most of these packages are quite
    expensive, and that the frequently upgraded versions are not free for
    the owners of the earlier versions (fortunately, there are inexpensive
    student versions of some of these packages). There is a constant
    demand of instructional textbooks by users of these packages. This
    demand is reflected in the growing number of such textbooks. Many of
    these books provide software support (diskette, CD-ROM, access by
    ftp). Such a textbook should meet, in my opinion, the following
    criteria: (1) The size should be small, not bulky like the complete
    technical descriptions of the software. (2) There should be a lot of
    examples of the use of the software covering a wide range of
    mathematical topics. Electronic versions of these examples should be
    made available for free to the users of the textbook
    (e.g. diskette/CD-ROM, access by ftp). (3) There should be a good
    supply of exercises covering the basic mathematical applications. (4)
    The book should be visually pleasing, easy to read, have good indexes
    and provide pointers to other books and electronic sources of
    information. The book under review provides, in addition to the actual
    text, an interactive exploratorium of its topics, based on the
    mechanism of Maple worksheets. These worksheets can be ``opened'' by
    the Maple program and they form a mixture of usual text, hypertext,
    and Maple commands and have a nice style appearance. They also can be
    ``exported'' in a file and included in a file for further treatment.
    The book meets all the aforementioned criteria (1)-(4) with elegance.
    There are many exercises which cover all the usual mathematical topics
    from linear algebra to differential equations and statistics. A
    valuable feature is an appendix with hints and answers for all
    exercises.  One of the highlights of the book is the examination of
    Riemann's non-differentiable function
    \[x \mapsto \sum_{k=1}^\infty{k^{-2}} sin(\pi kx)\]
    which is differentiable only at the rational points $p/q$ with $p$
    and $q$ odd and relatively prime, where its derivative is $-1/2$.

    The book is intended for students of mathematics, engineering
    sciences, and econometry. This book is an ideal guide for this purpose
    and it could probably be used along, without the bulky technical
    documentation of the Maple language. Note that Maple has a
    comprehensive on-line help program, which contains large parts of the
    original documentation.",

    "The goals of thie project described in this thesis are
    twofold. First, we wanted to demonstrate that if a programming
    language has a semantics that is complete and rigorous
    (mathematical), but not too complex, then substantial theorems can
    be proved about it. Second, we wanted to assess the utiliity of
    using an automated theorem prover to aid in such proofs. We chose
    SML as the language about which to prove theorems: it has a
    published semantics that is complete and rigorous, and while not
    exactly simple, is comprehensible. We encoded the semantics of
    Core SML into the theorem prover HOL (creating new definitional
    packages for HOL in the process). We proved important theorems
    about evaluation and about the type system. We also proved the
    type preservation theorem, which relates evaluation and typing,
    for a good portion of the language. We were not able to complete
    the proof of type preservation because it is not tur: we found
    counterexamples. These proofs demonstrate that a good semantics
    will allow the proof of programming language properties and allow
    the identification of trouble spotes in the language. The use of
    HOL had its plusses and minuses. On the whole the benefits greatly
    outweigh the drawbacks, enough so that we believe that these
    theorems could ot have been proved in amount of time taken by this
    project had we not use automated help.",

    "The development of polynomial-elimination techniques from classical
    theory to modern algorithms has undergone a tortuous and rugged
    path. This can be observed L. van der Waerden's elimination of the
    ``elimination theory'' chapter from from B. his classic Modern Algebra
    in later editions, A. Weil's hope to eliminate ``from algebraic
    geometry the last traces of elimination theory,'' and S. Abhyankar's
    suggestion to ``eliminate the eliminators of elimination theory.''
    The renaissance and recognition of polynomial elimination owe much to
    the advent and advance of modern computing technology, based on
    which effective algorithms are implemented and applied to diverse
    problems in science and engineering. In the last decade, both
    theorists and practitioners have more and more realized the
    significance and power of elimination methods and their underlying
    theories. Active and extensive research has contributed a great deal
    of new developments on algorithms and soft­ ware tools to the subject,
    that have been widely acknowledged. Their applications have taken
    place from pure and applied mathematics to geometric modeling and
    robotics, and to artificial neural networks. This book provides a
    systematic and uniform treatment of elimination algorithms that
    compute various zero decompositions for systems of multivariate 
    polynomials. The central concepts are triangular sets and systems of
    different kinds, in terms of which the decompositions are
    represented. The prerequisites for the concepts and algorithms are
    results from basic algebra and some knowledge of algorithmic
    mathematics.",

    "This paper presents a novel technique for manipulating structures
    which represents infinite power series.
    
    When power series are implemented using lazy evaluation, many
    operations can be written as simple recursive procedures. For example,
    the programs to generate the series for the elementary transcendental
    functions are almost transliterations of the defining integral
    equations. However, a naive lazy algorithm provides an implementation
    which may be orders of magnitude slower than a method which
    manipulates the coefficients explicitly.
    
    The technique described here allows a power series to be defined in a
    very natural but computationally inefficient way and transforms it to
    an equivalent, efficient form. This is achieved by using a fixed point
    operator on the delayed part to remove redundant calculations.
    
    This paper describes this fixed point method and the class of problems
    to which it is applicable. It has been used in Scratchpad II to
    improve the performance of a number of operations on infinite series,
    including division, reversion, special functions and the solution of
    linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations.
    
    A few examples are given of the method and of the speed up
    obtained. To illustrate, the computation of the first $n$ terms of
    exp($u$) for a dense, infinite series $u$ is reduced from $O(n^4)$ to
    $O(n^2)$ coefficient operations, the same as required by the standard

    "Scratchpad II is a language developed at Yorktown Heights for the
    implementation of a new computer algebra system. The need to model the
    intricate relationships among the datatypes representing mathematical
    objects has provided a number of challenges in the design of a type
    system for the programming language.
    
    In languages in which a datatype constructor may take multiple
    parameters, ensuring compatibility between them is extremely
    important. Scratchpad II addresses this issue by basing its
    implementation of abstract datatypes on {\sl categories}. Categories
    provide a convenient and useful method for specifying requirements on
    operations from datatypes. These requirements can be very complex when
    modelling mathematics.
    
    We show how categories provide multiple inheritance and how
    inheritance of specification is separated from inheritance of
    implementation. We also present implications of the type system on
    compilation of efficient code and flexibility of a weakly typed
    interactive user interface.
    
    Finally, the mechanisms of Scratchpad II are compared with those of
    traditional abstract datatype and object-oriented programming
    languages.",

    "The $A^{\#}$ compiler allows users of computer algebra to develop
    programs in a context where multiple programming languages are
    employed. The compiler translates programs written in the $A^{\#}$
    programming language to a low-level intermediate language, Foam,
    from which it can generate stand-alone programs, native object
    libraries to be linked with other applications, or code to be read
    into closed environments. In addition, Foam code may be directly
    executed using an interpreter provided with the $A^{\#}$ compiler.
    
    The $A^{\#}$ programming language provides support for object-oriented
    and functional programming styles. It is ``higher-order'' in the sense
    that both types and functions are first class, and may be manipulated
    in the same ways as any other values. The primary considerations in
    the formulation of the language have been generality, composibility,
    and efficiency. The language has been designed to admit a number of
    important optimizations, allowing compilation to machine code which is
    in many instances of efficiency comparable to that produced by a C or
    Fortran compiler.
    
    The original motivation for $A^{\#}$ comes from the field of computer
    algebra: to provide an improved extension language for the Axiom
    computer algebra system.",

  abstract = 
    "We study type systems for computer algebra systems, which frequently
    correspond to the ``pragmatically developed'' typing constructs used
    in AXIOM.
    
    A central concept is that of type classes which correspond to AXIOM
    categories. We will show that types can be syntactically described as
    terms of a regular order-sorted signature if no type parameters are
    allowed. Using results obtained for the functional programming
    language Haskell we will show that the problem of type inference is
    decidable.  This result still holds if higher-order functions are
    present and parametric polymorphism is used.  These additional typing
    constructs are useful for further extensions of existing computer
    algebra systems: These typing concepts can be used to implement
    category theoretic constructs and there are many well known
    constructive interactions between category theory and algebra.
    
    On the one hand we will show that there are well known techniques to
    specify many important type classes algebraically, and we will also
    show that a formal and algorithmically Feasible treatment of the
    interactions of algebraically specified data types and type classes is
    possible.  On the other hand we will prove that there are quite
    elementary examples arising in computer algebra which need very
    ``strong'' formalisms to be specified and are thus hard to handle
    algorithmically.
    
    We will show that it is necessary to distinguish between types and
    elements as parameters of parameterized type classes. The type
    inference problem for the former remains decidable whereas for the
    latter it becomes undecidable.  We will also show that such a
    distinction can be made quite naturally.
    
    Type classes are second-order types.  Although we will show that there
    are constructions used in mathematics which imply that type classes
    have to become first-order types in order to model the examples
    naturally, we will also argue that this does not seem to be the case
    in areas currently accessible for an algebra system. We will only
    sketch some systems that have been developed during the last years in
    which the concept of type classes as first-order types can be
    expressed. For some of these systems the type inference problem was
    proven to be undecidable.

    Another fundamental concept for a type system of a computer algebra
    system — at least for the purpose of a user interface — are coercions.
    We will show that there are cases which can be modeled by coercions
    but not by an ``inheritance mechanism'', i. e. the concept of coercions
    is not only orthogonal to the one of type classes but also to more
    general formalisms as are used in object-oriented languages.  We will
    define certain classes of coercions and impose conditions on important
    classes of coercions which will imply that the meaning of an expression 
    is independent of the particular coercions that are used in order to 
    type it.

    We shall also impose some conditions on the interaction between
    polymorphic operations defined in type classes and coercions that will
    yield a unique meaning of an expression independent of the type which
    is assigned to it — if coercions are present there will very
    frequently be several possibilities to assign types to expressions.

    Often it is not only possible to coerce one type into another but it
    will be the case that two types are actually isomorphic .  We will
    show that isomorphic types have properties that cannot be deduced from
    the properties of coercions and will shortly discuss other possibilities 
    to model type isomorphisms.  There are natural examples of type 
    isomorphisms occurring in the area of computer algebra that have
    a ``problematic'' behavior. So we will prove for a certain example that
    the type isomorphisms cannot be captured by a finite set of coercions
    by proving that the naturally associated equational theory is not
    finitely axiomatizable.

    Up to now few results are known that would give a clear dividing line
    between classes of coercions which have a decidable type inference
    problem and classes for which type inference becomes undecidable.
    We will give a type inference algorithm for some important classes of
    coercions.

    Other typing constructs which are again quite orthogonal to the
    previous ones are those of {\sl partial functions} and of types 
    {\sl depending on elements} . We will link the treatment of {\sl partial 
    functions} in AXIOM to the one used in order-sorted algebras and will 
    show some problems which arise if a seemingly more expressive solution 
    were used. There are important cases in which {\sl types depending on 
    elements} arise naturally.  We will show that not only type inference 
    but even type checking is undecidable for relevant cases occurring in 
    computer algebra.",

    these programs are compared and contrasted, and tutorial information

    packages are quantitatively compared using standard test suites,
    giving the possibility to asses the most appropriate for a particular
    user or application. The origins of these systems are revealed and
    many of their behaviors analyzed. This furnishes a feel for where the
    current computer algebra system state of the art stays and what can be
    expected for existing and future systems. The book is organized in
    several chapters written by different authors. Chapters 1,2, and 3 are
    organized as reviews, comparisons, and critiques of CAS
    capabilities. Then more technical issues are discussed considering
    different approaches taken by different CAS: simplifying square roots
    of square roots by denesting (chapter 4), complex number calculation
    (chapter 5), efficiently computing Chebyshev polynomials (chapter 6),
    solving single equations and systems of polynomial equations (chapters
    7, 8), computing limits (chapter 9), multiple integration (chapter
    10), solving ordinary differential equation (chapter 11), integration
    of nonlinear evolution equations (chapter 12), code generation
    (chapter 13), evaluation of expressions and programs in the embedded
    computer algebra programming language (chapter 14), and computer
    algebra in education (chapter 15). Chapter 16 covers the origin of CA,

    lexicographic order, $d_3$ (say) must be a root of a certain 
    irreducible polynomial $\varphi$ of degree 6. Joining this
    with a Galois group computation for $\varphi$ over $L$, it is shown 
    that a solvable and necessarily transitive Gal($\varphi$) will be a 
    necessary and sufficient condition for expressibility of $d_3$ (clear) 
    and, thanks to the form of the Groebner basis, also of $d_1,d_2$ in 
    radicals. Upon a discriminant computation of $\varphi$ and use of 
    results of G. Butler and J. McKay [Commun. Algebra 11,
    863-911 (1983; Zbl 0518.20003)] and J. McKay and L. Soicher [J. Number
    Theory 20, 273-281 (1985; Zbl 0579.12006)], this allows the author to
    deduce the mentioned result. For $n=4$, though the author cannot get as
    complete information about Galois groups etc., he can deduce e.g. that
    if $s_1,\cdots,s_4$ are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{Q}$, 
    then $d_1,\cdots,d_4$ are not expressible in radicals over 
    $\mathbb{Q}(s_1,\cdots,s_4)$. He mentions, however, a solvable subcase.",

    "The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure for rewrite rule systems is
    of wide applicability in symbolic and algebraic computation. 
    Attempts to reduce the complexity of this completion algorithm are
    reported in the literature. Already in their seminal 1967 paper
    D.E. Knuth and P.B. Bendix have suggested to keep all the rules
    iterreduced during the execution of the algorithm. G. Huet has
    presented a version of the completion algorithm in which every
    rewrite rule is kept in reduced form with respect to all the other
    rules in the system. Borrowing an idea of Buchberger's for the
    completion of bases of polynomial ideals the author has proposed
    in 1983 a criterion for detecting ``unnecessary'' critical
    pairs. If a critical pair is recognized as unnecessary then one
    need not apply the costly process of computing normal forms to
    it. It has been unclear whether these approaches can be
    combined. We demonstrate that it is possible to keep all the
    rewrite rules interreduced and still use a criterion for
    eliminating unnecessary critical pairs.",

    "Equational theorem proving is interesting both from a mathematical
    and a computational point of view. Many mathematical structures like
    monoids, groups, etc. can be described by equational axioms. So the
    theory of free monoids, free groups, etc. is the equational theory
    defined by these axioms. A decision procedure for the equational
    theory is a solution for the word problem over the associated
    algebraic structure. From a computational point of view, abstract data
    types are basically described by equations. Thus, proving properties
    of an abstract data type amounts to proving theorems in the associated
    equational theory.

    One approach to equational theorem proving consists in associating a
    direction with the equational axioms, thus transforming them into
    rewrite rules. Now in order to prove an equation $a=b$, the rewrite
    rules are applied to both sides, finally yielding reduced versions
    $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ of the left and right hand sides, respectively. If
    $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ agree syntactically, then the equation holds in
    the equational theory. However, in general this argument cannot be
    reversed; $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ might be different even if $a=b$ is a
    theorem. The reason for this problem is that the rewrite system might
    not have the Church-Rosser property. So the goal is to take the
    original rewrite system and transform it into an equivalent one which
    has the desired Church-Rosser property.

    We show how rewrite systems can be used for proving theorems in
    equational and inductive theories, and how an equational specification
    of a problem can be turned into a rewrite program.",

    concerned with polynomials. It introduces algorithms from the bottom
    up, starting from very basic problems in computation over the
    integers, and finally leading to, e.g. advanced topics in
    factorization, solution of polynomial equations and constructive
    algebraic geometry. It is not based on a particular computer algebra
    program system.
    
    After two introductory chapters, the book contains six chapters with
    the following respective topics: computation by homomorphic images,
    gcd computation, factorization and decomposition of polynomials,
    linear systems and Hankel systems, Gröbner bases. The last three
    chapters are concerned with applications of polynomial algorithms to
    higher level problems in computer algebra. In particular, a decision
    algorithm in the elementary theory of real closed fields, a
    description of Gosper’s algorithm for solving summation problems, and
    an algorithm for deciding whether an algebraic curve can be
    parametrized by rational functions (and if so for computing such a
    parametrization) is given. Along the way, the complexity of many of
    the algorithms is investigated. Each chapter ends with rich
    bibliographical notes.

    provide an entry into the current research literature, but not to present
    the most recent research results.
    
    The first half of the course (taught by me) will deal with basic 
    mathematics and algorithms for computer algebra, primarily at the level of
    arithmetic and elementary abstract algebra, including an introduction
    to GCDs and the solution of univariate polynomial equations. This
    leads into the second half of the course (taught by Dr Jim Skea) on
    the more advanced problems of polynomial factorization, indefinite 
    integration, multivariate polynomial equations, etc.
    
    The first week provides an introduction to the computing aspects
    of computer algebra, and contains almost no mathematics. It is 
    intended to show how the later theory can be implemented for practical
    computation. The second week provides a rapid but superficial survey
    of the abstract algebra that is most important for computer algebra.
    The next five weeks will build on this abstract basis to do some more
    concrete mathematics in more details, referring back to the basis 
    setablished in the first two weeks as necessary.
    
    At the end of each set of notes will be exercises, one (or more) of
    which will be assessed.",

    "There is a growing interest in the integration of mechanized
    reasoning systems such as automated theorem provers, computer algebra
    systems, and model checkers.  State-of-the-art reasoning systems are
    the result of many man-years of careful development and engineering,
    and usually they provide a high degree of sophistication in their
    respective domain.  Yet they often perform poorly when applied outside
    the domain they have been designed for.  The problem of integrating
    mechanized reasoning systems is therefore being perceived as an
    important issue in automated reasoning.  In this paper we present
    the Logic Broker Architecture, a framework which provides the needed
    infrastructure for making mechanized reasoning systems interoperate.
    The architecture provides location transparency, a way to forward
    requests for logical services to appropriate reasoning systems via a
    simple registration/subscription mechanism, and a translation
    mechanism which ensures the transparent and provably sound exchange of
    logical services.",

    and development. It is based on a critical selection of features that
    have already been explored in various contexts, including subsorts,
    partial functions, first-order logic, and structured and architectural
    specifications. CASL should facilitate interoperability of many
    existing algebraic prototyping and verification tools.
    
    This paper gives an overview of the CASL design. The major issues that
    had to be resolved in the design process are indicated, and all the
    main concepts and constructs of CASL are briefly explained and

    underlying part of the original object, or a different representation
    of that object.  This paper examines some of the issues involved in
    the computer implementation of systems that allow a user to define
    coercions that may then be left implicit in the syntax of expressions
    and synthesised automatically.  From a type-theoretic perspective,
    coercions are often left implicit in mathematical texts, so they can
    be used to improve the readability of a formalisation, and to
    implement other tricks of syntax if so desired.",

    being a standard informal account of some mathematics.  In addition

    problems in reconciling the formal nature of the development with the

    for solving these problems, and discusses the advantages and

    implementation and use of implicit coercions within the type theory,
    the styles of proof that can be used, and the borrowing of concepts
    from the literate programming paradigm.  To be more specific, the
    algebra in question is a constructive version of the fundamental

    "Computer algebra systems (CASs) and automated theorem provers (ATPs)
    exhibit complementary abilities. CASs focus on efficiently solving
    domain-specific problems. ATPs are designed to allow for the
    formalization and solution of wide classes of problems within some
    logical framework. Integrating CASs and ATPs allows for the solution
    of problems of a higher complexity than those confronted by each class
    alone. However, most experiments conducted so far followed an ad-hoc
    approach, resulting in tailored solutions to specific problems. A
    structured and principled approach is necessary to allow for the sound
    integration of systems in a modular way. The Open Mechanized Reasoning
    Systems (OMRS) framework was introduced for the specification and
    implementation of mechanized reasoning systems, e.g. ATPs. The
    approach was recasted to the domain of computer algebra systems. In
    this paper, we introduce a generalization of OMRS, named OMSCS (Open
    Mechanized Symbolic Computation Systems). We show how OMSCS can be
    used to soundly express CASs, ATPs, and their integration, by
    formalizing a combination between the Isabelle prover and the Maple
    algebra system. We show how the integrated system solves a problem
    which could not be tackled by each single system alone.",

    "The intelligent behavior of a system is based upon its represented
    knowledge and inference capabilities. In this paper we report on a
    knowledge representation and reasoning system, developed at the
    University of Karlsruhe, called Mantra. The system provides four
    different knowledge representation methods -- first-order logic,
    terminological language, semantic networks, and production rules --
    distributed into a three levels architecture. The first three methods
    form the lowest level of the architecture, the epistemological
    level. The supported hybrid inferences as well as the management of
    knowledge bases form the second level, called logical level. Finally,
    the third level, the heuristic level, provides representation of
    procedural knowledge of a domain, and the introduction of ad hoc
    rules. This knowledge is represented in terms of production rules
    which are processed by a Ops5-like rule interpreter. This paper mainly
    describes the introduction of this level into the hybrid system. The
    semantics of the knowledge representation methods of the
    epistemological level is dened according to a four-valued logic
    approach. This denition insures that all inference algorithms are
    sound, complete and decidable. The system has been implemented in
    Common Lisp using the object-oriented extension CLOS, and the
    graphical user interface was implemented in C with XToolkit.",

    compact and easy to understand. They are as simple as their
    equivalents in a functional programming language, where there is no
    restriction on recursive calls. Given a general recursive algorithm,
    the method consists in defining an inductive special-purpose
    accessibility predicate that characterises the inputs on which the
    algorithm terminates. The type-theoretic version of the algorithm can
    then be defined by structural recursion on the proof that the input
    values satisfy this predicate. When formalising nested algorithms, the
    special-purpose accessibility predicate and the type-theoretic version
    of the algorithm must be defined simultaneously because they depend on
    each other. Since the method separates the computational part from
    the logical part of a definition, formalising partial functions

    available at present: the logic, the syntax, the mathematics, and the
    prover gap, respectively. We discuss higher order logic without
    extensionality and with set theory as a subtheory as a logic frame for
    future systems and we propose to start from existing computer algebra
    systems and proceed by adding new facilities for closing the syntax,
    mathematics, and the prover gaps. Mathematica seems to be a
    particularly suitable candidate for such an approach. As the main
    technique for structuring mathematical knowledge, mathematical methods
    (including algorithms), and also mathematical proofs, we underline the
    practical importance of functors and show how they can be naturally

    One principle of structured programming is that a program should be
    separated into meaningful independent subprograms, which are then
    combined so that the relation of the parts to the whole can be clearly
    established.  This paper describes several alternative ways to compose
    programs. The main method used is to permit the programmer to denote
    by an expression the sequence of values taken on by a variable. The
    sequence is represented by a function called a stream, which is a
    functional analog of a coroutine. The conventional while and for loops
    of structured programming may be composed by a technique of stream
    processing (analogous to list processing), which results in more
    structured programs than the orignals. This technique makes it
    possible to structure a program in a natural way into its logically
    separate parts, which can then be considered independently."

    a reformulation of the standard theory of Groebner bases which
    uses generalised inductive definitions. We isolate the main

    the open induction principle [Rao88,Coq92] to interpret it by
    induction. This leads to short constructive proofs of Dickson’s
    lemma and Hilbert’s basis theorem, which are used to give an
    integrated development of Buchberger’s algorithm. An important
    point of this work is that the elegance and brevity of the
    original proofs are maintained while the new proofs also have a

    Computer algebra systems of the new generation, like Scratchpad, are
    characterized by a very rich type concept, which models the
    relationship between mathematical domains of computation. To use these
    systems interactively, however, the user should be freed of type
    information. A type inference mechanism determines the appropriate
    function to call. All known models which allow to define a semantics
    for type inference cannot express the rich ``mathematical'' type
    structure, so presently type inference is done heuristically.  The
    following paper defines a semantics for a subproblem thereof, namely
    coercion, which is based on rewrite rules. From this definition, and
    efficient coercion algorith for Scratchpad is constructed using graph

  abstract =
    "Language researchers and designers have extended a wide variety
    of type systems to support {\sl gradual typing}, which enables
    languages to seemlessly combine dynamic and static checking. These
    efforts consistently demonstrate that designing a satisfactory
    gradual counterpart to a static type system is challenging, and
    this challenge only increases with the sophistication of the type
    system. Graudal type system designers need more formal tools to
    help them conceptualize, structure, and evaluate their designs.

    In this paper, we propose a new formal foundation for graudal
    typing, drawing on principles from abstract interpretation to give
    gradual types a semantics in terms of pre-existing static
    types. Abstracting Gradual Typing (AGT for short) yields a formal
    account of {\sl consistency} -- one of the cornerstones of the
    gradual typing approach -- that subsumes existing notions of
    consistency, which were developed through intuition and ad hoc
    reasoning. 

    Given a syntax-directed static typing judgment, the AGT approach
    induces a corresponding gradual typing judgment. Then the type
    safety proof for the underlying static discipline induces a
    dynamic semantics for gradual programs defined over
    source-language typing derivations. The AGT approach does not
    resort to an externally justified cast calculus; instead, run-time
    check naturally arise by deducing evidence for consistent
    judgements during proof reduction.

    To illustrate the approach, we develop a novel gradually-typed
    counterpart for a language with record subtyping. Gradual
    languages designed with the AGT approach satisfy {\sl by
    construction} the refined criteria for gradual typing set forth by
    Siek and colleagues.",

    "Gradual typing is a discipline for integrating dynamic checking
    into a static type system. Since its introduction in functional
    languages, it has been adapted to a variety of type systems,
    including object-oriented, security, and substructural. This work
    studies its application to implictly typed languages based on type
    inference. Siek and Vachharajani designed a gradual type inference
    system and algorithm that infers gradual types but still rejects
    ill-typed static programs. However, the type system requires local
    reasoning about type substitutions, an imperative inference
    algorithm, and a subtle correctness statement.

    This paper introduces a new approach to gradual type inference,
    driven by the principle that gradual inference should only produce
    static types. We present a static implicitly typed language, its
    gradual counterpart, and a type inference procedure. The gradual
    system types the same programs as Siek and Vachharajani, but has a
    modular structure amenable to extension. The language admits
    let-polymorphism, and its dynamics are defined by translation to
    the Polymorphic Blame Calculus (Ahmed et al. 2009, 2011).

    The principal types produced by our initial type system mask the
    distinction between static parametric polymorphism and
    polymorphism that can be attributed to gradual typing. To expose
    this difference, we distinguish static type parameters from
    gradual type parameters and reinterpret gradual type consistency
    accordingly. The resulting extension enables programs to be
    interpreted using either the polymorphic or monomorphic Blame
    Calculi.",

    "Object oriented languages are an important tool to achieve software
    reusability in any kind of application and can increase dramatically
    software productivity in some special fields; they are also considered
    a logical step in the evolution of object oriented languages.  But
    these languages lack a formal foundation, which is needed both to
    develop tools and as a basis for the future evolution of these
    languages; they lack also a strong type system, which would be
    essential to assure that level of reliability which is required to
    large evolving systems.  Recently some researches have tried to
    insulate the basic mechanisms of object oriented languages and to
    embed them in strongly typed functional languages, giving to these
    mechanism a mathematical semantics and a set of strong type
    rules. This is a very promising approach which also allows a
    converging evolution of both the typed functional and the object
    oriented programming paradigms, making it possible a technology
    transfer in both directions.  Most works in this field are very
    technical and deal just with one aspect of object oriented
    programming; many of them use a very similar framework.  In this work
    we describe and exemplify that common framework and we survey some of
    the more recent and promising works on more specific features, using
    the framework introduced.  We describe the resuks achieved and point
    out some problems which are still open, especially those arising from
    the interactions between different mechanisms.",

    "The object oriented paradigm, which advocates bottom-up program
    development, appears at first sight to run counter to the classical,
    top-down approach of structured programming.  The deep requirement of
    structured programming, however, is that programming should be based
    on well-defined abstractions with clear meaning rather than on
    incidental characteristics of computing machinery. This requirement
    can be met by object oriented programming and, in fact, object
    oriented programs may have better structure than programs obtained by
    functional decomposition.
    
    The definitions of the basic components of object oriented
    programming, object, class, and inheritance, are still sufficiently
    fluid to provide many choices for the designer of an object oriented
    language. Full support of objects in a typed language requires a
    number of features, including classes, inheritance, genericity,
    renaming, and redefinition. Although each of these features is simple
    in itself, interactions between features can become complex. For
    example, renaming and redefinition may interact in unexpected ways.
    In this paper, we show that appropriate design choices can yield a
    language that fulfills the promise of object oriented programming
    without sacrificing the requirements of structured programming.",

    The automatic computation of limits can be reduced to two main
    sub-problems. The first one is asymptotic comparison where one must
    decide automatically which one of two functions in a specified class
    dominates the other one asymptotically. The second one is asymptotic
    cancellation and is usually exemplified by
    \[e^x[exp(1/x+e^{-x})-exp(1/x)],\quad{}x \leftarrow \infty\]

    In this example, if the sum is expanded in powers of $1/x$, the
    expansion always yields $O(x^{-k})$, and this is not enough to
    conclude.

    In 1990, J.Shackell found an algorithm that solved both these problems
    for the case of $exp-log$ functions, i.e. functions build by recursive
    application of exponential, logarithm, algebraic extension and field
    operations to one variable and the rational numbers. D. Gruntz and

    classes and the flexibility of locales. Furthermore, we construct

    "We are concerned with how computer theorem provers should expect
    users to communicate proofs to them.  There are many stylistic choices
    that still allow the machine to generate a completely formal proof
    object.  The most obvious choice is the amount of guidance required
    from the user, or from the machine perspective, the degree of
    automation provided.  But another important consideration, which we
    consider particularly significant, is the bias towards a
    'procedural' or 'declarative' proof style.  We will explore this
    choice in depth, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of
    declarative and procedural styles for proofs in pure mathematics and
    for verification applications.  We conclude with a brief summary of
    our own experiments in trying to combine both approaches.",

    anti-derivatives of elementary functions, or exponentials of such
    anti-derivatives, or anti-derivative of those, etc. We should note
    that Equation 1 can be solved using power series, integrals which
    depend on a parameter, or Bessel functions of order $1/3$.  However,
    as we will see, none of these methods of solution are ``algebraic'' in
    nature.

    We aim to give a precise definition of ``algebraic'' by developing the
    theory of {\sl differential algebra}, which is largely the work of
    Ritt. Other contributors are Liouville, Picard, Vessoit, Kolchin,
    Rosenlicht, ... The part of differential Galois theory which leads to
    a proof of Abel's celebrated result that a general polynomial equation
    of degree five or higher cannot be solved by radicals. In effort to
    derive these two areas in parallel, we will also explain why the
    polynomial equation
    \[x^5-4x^2-2=0\]
    has no solutions which can be written as radicals of solutions to
    lower degree polyomial equations.",

    "In this paper, we present our initial results on the behavioral
    analysis of computer algebra programs.  The main goal of our work is
    to find typing and behavioral errors in such programs by static
    analysis of the source code.  This task is more complex for widely
    used computer algebra languages (Maple and Mathematica) as these are
    fundamentally different from classical languages: for example they
    support non-standard types of objects, e.g.  symbols, unevaluated
    expressions, polynomials etc.; moreover they use type information to
    direct the flow of control in the program and have no clear
    difference between declaration and assignment.  For this purpose, we
    have defined the syntax and the formal type system for a substantial
    subset of the computer algebra language Maple, which we call MiniMaple.
    The type system is implemented by a type checker, which verifies
    the type correctness and respectively reports typing errors.  We have

    specification and verification of computer algebra programs and its
    application to a non-trivial computer algebra package.  The programs
    are written in the language MiniMaple which is a substantial subset of
    the language of the commercial computer algebra system Maple.  The
    main goal of the thesis is the application of light-weight formal
    methods to MiniMaple programs (annotated with types and behavioral
    specifications) for finding internal inconsistencies and violations of
    methods preconditions by employing static program analysis.  This task
    is more complex for a computer algebra language like Maple that for
    conventional programming languages, as Maple supports non-standard
    types of objects and also requires abstract data types to model
    algebraic concepts and notions.  
    
    As a starting point, we have defined
    and formalized a syntax, semantics, type system and specification
    language for MiniMaple .  For verification, we automatically 
    translate the (types and specification) annotated MiniMaple program into a
    behaviorally equivalent program in the intermediate language Why3ML of
    the verification tool Why3; from the translated program, Why3
    generates verification conditions whose correctness can be proved by
    various automated and interactive theorem provers (e.g.  Z3 and Coq).
    Furthermore, we have defined a denotational semantics of MiniMaple and
    its specification language and proved the soundness of the translation
    with respect to the operational semantics of Why3ML. Finally, we
    discuss the application of our verification framework to the Maple
    package DifferenceDifferential developed at our institute to compute

    mechanisms that support the use of data and control abstractions. This
    paper provides an introduction to the abstraction mechanisms of

    "The ML family of languages and LCF-style interactive theorem proving
    have been closely related from their beginnings about 30 years
    ago. Here we report on a recent project to adapt both the Poly/ML
    compiler and the Isabelle theorem prover to current multicore
    hardware. Checking theories and proofs in typical Isabelle application
    takes minutes or hours, and users expect to make efficient use of
    ``home machines'' with 2-8 cores, or more.
    
    Poly/ML and Isabelle are big and complex software systems that have
    evolved over more than two decades. Faced with the requirement to
    deliver a stable and efficient parallel programming environment, many
    infrastructure layers had to be reworked: from low-level system
    threads to high-level principles of value-oriented programming. At
    each stage we carefully selected from the many existing concepts for
    parallelism, and integrated them in a way that fits smoothly into the
    idea of purely functional ML with the addition of synchronous
    exceptions and asynchronous interrupts.
    
    From the Isabelle/ML perspective, the main concept to manage parallel
    evaluation is that of ``future values''. Scheduling is implicit, but it
    is also possible to specify dependencies and priorities. In addition,
    block-structured groups of futures with propagation of exceptions
    allow for alternative functional evaluation (such as parallel search),
    without requiring user code to tackle concurrency. Our library also
    provides the usual parallel combinators for functions on lists, and
    analogous versions on prover tactics.
    
    Despite substantial reorganization in the background, only minimal
    changes are occasionally required in user ML code, and none at the
    Isabelle application level (where parallel theory and proof processing
    is fully implicit). The present implementation is able to address more
    than 8 cores effectively, while the earlier version of the official
    Isabelle2009 release works best for 2-4 cores. Scalability beyond 16
    cores still poses some extra challenges, and will require further
    improvements of the Poly/ML runtime system (heap management and
    garbage collection), and additional parallelization of Isabelle
    application logic.",

    "An important task in automated theorem proving is computing with
    ``arbitrary but fixed'' constants. This kind of highschool proving
    occurs in the main part of most proofs. The current master's thesis
    presents an automated prover that focuses on such computations with
    symbols. The prover uses equalities and equivalences in the knowledge
    base to rewrite a goal formula. In all formulae there may be universal
    quantifiers and some selected logical connectives. Special syntax
    elements support case distinctions and sequence variables. The prover
    uses a specialized method for proving equalities and an important
    feature is proving by cases. An extension allows induction over some
    predefined domains. Additionally to the prover implementation in
    Mathematica, there is a tracer that prints a protocol of the proof
    flow. Since the code for this tracer is separated from the prover,
    there may be more than one tracer with different output. But more
    important is that a user can inspect the code of prover without being
    confused by technical details for generating some nice output. The
    main motivation for this prover is a new extension of the Theorema
    system. The aim is an environment for defining new prover in the same
    language as theorems. The advantage is clear, existing prover may
    prove facts of a new one, for example the correctness. Using this it
    is possible to build up a hierarchy of formally checked provers. For
    such reasoning about reasoners a starting point needs induction on the
    structure of terms and formulae. A first prover in the hierarchy will
    need computations with symbols in many proof branches. This may be
    done by the current Symbolic Computation Prover.",

    "The constructive approach to mathematics has enjoyed a renaissance,
    caused in large part by the appearance of Errett Bishop's book
    Foundations of constructive analysis in 1967, and by the subtle
    influences of the proliferation of powerful computers. Bishop
    demonstrated that pure mathematics can be developed from a
    constructive point of view while maintaining a continuity with
    classical terminology and spirit; much more of classical mathematics
    was preserved than had been thought possible, and no classically false
    theorems resulted, as had been the case in other constructive schools
    such as intuitionism and Russian constructivism. The computers created
    a widespread awareness of the intuitive notion of an effecti ve
    procedure, and of computation in principle, in addi tion to
    stimulating the study of constructive algebra for actual
    implementation, and from the point of view of recursive function
    theory. In analysis, constructive problems arise instantly because we
    must start with the real numbers, and there is no finite procedure for
    deciding whether two given real numbers are equal or not (the real
    numbers are not discrete) . The main thrust of constructive
    mathematics was in the direction of analysis, although several
    mathematicians, including Kronecker and van der waerden, made
    important contributions to construc­ tive algebra. Heyting, working in
    intuitionistic algebra, concentrated on issues raised by considering
    algebraic structures over the real numbers, and so developed a
    handmaiden'of analysis rather than a theory of discrete algebraic
    structures.",

    "Herewith, a fairly old concept is published for the first time and
    named ”Lucas Interpretation”. This has been implemented in a
    prototype, which has been proved useful in educational practice and
    has gained academic relevance with an emerging generation of
    educational mathematics assistants (EMA) based on Computer Theorem
    Proving (CTP).  
    
    Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), i.e.  deduction, is
    the most reliable technology used to check user input. However ATP is
    inherently weak in automatically generating solutions for arbitrary
    problems in applied mathematics. This weakness is crucial for EMAs:
    when ATP checks user input as incorrect and the learner gets stuck
    then the system should be able to suggest possible next steps.  
    
    The key idea of Lucas Interpretation is to compute the steps of a
    calculation following a program written in a novel CTP-based
    programming language, i.e. computation provides the next steps.  User
    guidance is generated by combining deduction and computation: the
    latter is performed by a specific language interpreter, which works
    like a debugger and hands over control to the learner at breakpoints,
    i.e.  tactics generating the steps of calculation.  The interpreter
    also builds up logical contexts providing ATP with the data required
    for checking user input, thus combining computation and deduction.
    
    The paper describes the concepts underlying Lucas Interpretation so
    that open questions can adequately be addressed, and prerequisites for
    further work are provided.",

    technology.  Educational objectives for the development of TP-based
    systems are discussed and concluded with some predictions on possible
    impact of TP-based educational mathematics assistants.

    "The unification of logic and functional programming, like the Holy
    Grail, is sought by countless people [6, 14]. In reporting our
    attempt, we first discuss the motivation. We argue that logic
    programming is still immature, compared with functional programming,
    because few logic programs are both useful and pure.  Functions can
    help to purify logic programming, for they can eliminate certain uses
    of the cut and can express certMn negations positively.

    More generally, we suggest that the traditional paradigm -- logic
    programming as first-order logic -- is seriously out of step with
    practice. We offer an alternative paradigm. We view the logic program
    as an inductive definition of sets and relations. This view explains
    certain uses of Negation as Failure, and explains why most attempts to
    extend PROLO G to larger fragments of first-order logic have not been
    successful. It suggests a logic language with functions, 
    incorporating equational unification.

    We have implemented a prototype of this language. It is very slow,
    but complete, and appear to be faster than some earlier
    implementations of narrowing.  Our experiments illustrate the
    programming style and shed light on the further development of such
    languages.",

    intended for meta-programs such as theorem provers, proof
    transformers, or type inference programs for programming languages
    with complex type systems. Elf unifies logic definition (in the
    style of LF, the Edinburgh Logical Framework) with logic
    programming (in the style of $\lambda$Prolog). It achieves this
    unification by giving {\sl types} an operational interpretation,
    much the same way that Prolog gives certain formulas
    (Horn-clauses) an operational interpretation. Novel features of
    Elf include: (1) the Elf search process automatically constructs
    terms that can represent object-logic proofs, and thus a program
    need not construct them explicitly, (2( the partial correectness
    of meta-programs with respect to a given logic can be expressed
    and proved in Elf itself, and (3) Elf exploits Elliott's
    unification algorithm for a $\lambda$-calculus with dependent

    "Polynomial systems can be found in many industrial applications. They
    are also in the heart of effective algebraic geometry. A fundamental
    tool for studying them is the Groebner bases. The knowledge of this
    paricular base of the ideal generated by the polynomials composing the
    system allows us to compute in $A=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$, the quotient
    algebra, and this is necessary when we try to solve. Nevertheless,
    Groebner bases computations rely heavily on the introduction of
    monomial ordering. This introduces a certain rigidity in the
    computation and thus numerical instability. We propose a new algorithm
    that tries to remedy that problem. It generalises Groebner bases
    computation and is much less numerically instable. To do this, we
    decrease the requirement of monomial ordering, and use a new normal
    form criterion. We then give an algorithm and prove its termination
    and correctness when the input polynomial system is
    0-dimensional. After, we compare it with the previously known methods
    and show how it can be seen as a generalisation of them. Next, we
    detail how we implemented it in C++ using the Synaps library. We also
    describe the sparse matrix elimination algorithm we used in or
    program. Finally, we present some of the experiments we have done with

   "Symbolic and logic computation systems ranging from computer algebra
   systems to theorem provers are finding their way into science,
   technology, mathematics and engineering. But such systems rely on
   explicitly or implicitly represented mathematical knowledge that needs
   to be managed to use such systems effectively.
   
   While mathematical knowledge management (MKM) ``in the small'' is
   well-studied, scaling up to large, highly interconnected corpora
   remains difficult. We hold that in order to realize MKM “in the
   large”, we need representation languages and software architectures
   that are designed systematically with large-scale processing in mind.
   
   Therefore, we have designed and implemented the Mmt language – a
   module system for mathematical theories. Mmt is designed as the
   simplest possible language that combines a module system, a
   foundationally uncommitted formal semantics, and web-scalable
   implementations. Due to a careful choice of representational
   primitives, Mmt allows us to integrate existing representation
   languages for formal mathematical knowledge in a simple, scalable
   formalism. In particular, Mmt abstracts from the underlying
   mathematical and logical foundations so that it can serve as a
   standardized representation format for a formal digital
   library. Moreover, Mmt systematically separates logic-dependent and
   logic-independent concerns so that it can serve as an interface layer
   between computation systems and MKM systems.",

   The Mmt API implements the Mmt language along with multiple backends

   access. Moreover, it implements a wide variety of Mmt-based knowledge

   "Throughout the twentieth century, the automation of formal logics in
   computers has created unprecedented potential for practical
   applications of logic—most prominently the mechanical verification of
   mathematics and software. But the high cost of these applications
   makes them infeasible but for a few flagship projects, and even those
   are negligible compared to the ever-rising needs for verification. One
   of the biggest challenges in the future of logic will be to enable
   applications at much larger scales and simultaneously at much lower
   costs. This will require a far more efficient allocation of
   resources. Wherever possible, theoretical and practical results must
   be formulated generically so that they can be instantiated to
   arbitrary logics; this will allow reusing results in the face of
   today’s multitude of application-oriented and therefore diverging
   logical systems. Moreover, the software engineering problems
   concerning automation support must be decoupled from the theoretical
   problems of designing logics and calculi; this will allow researchers
   outside or at the fringe of logic to contribute scalable
   logic-independent tools. Anticipating these needs, the author has
   developed the Mmt framework. It offers a modern approach towards
   defining, analyzing, implementing, and applying logics that focuses on
   modular design and logic-independent results. This paper summarizes
   the ideas behind and the results about Mmt. It focuses on showing how
   Mmt. provides a theoretical and practical framework for the future of

    "Various algebraic models have been used to implement symbolic
    procedures for solving summations and recurrences. Surprisingly, one
    model that has received little attention in the development of
    symbolic algorithms is generating functions. Generating function
    methods for discrete mathematics provide an ad hoc collection of
    techniques for solving summations and recurrences. In this work we
    consider their systematic application to symbolic computation.
     
    To demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of generating
    functions as an algebraic model of computation, we develop and
    implement algorithms for manipulating generating functions and the
    sequences that they encode. In particular, we concentrate on
    algorithms for solving summations and recurrences. Techniques are
    developed to handle special functions and hybrid terms, which are
    terms involving two or more factors.
     
    Given various classes of summations and recurrences we develop a
    theory to characterize the form of their solution. This allows us to
    demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to solve problems of these
    classes. This knowledge also assists us in developing algorithms that
    know where to look for a solution rather than doing an ad hoc search
    for a solution."

    Bracket coefficients for polynomials are introduced. These are like

    presented, and a new criterion for determining whether a bracket

    $F$ and a precision $\mu$, and $G$ be a true Gr{\"o}bner basis of
    $F$. Then, as $\mu$ approaches infinity, $G_\mu$ converges to $G$

    separation is realized by using a powerful computer algebra system
    during the planning process to do non-trivial symbolic
    computations. Results of these computations are checked during the
    refinement of a proof plan to a calculus level proof using a small,
    self-implemented system that gives us protocol information on its

    low-level calculus proof ensuring the correctness of the

    "Subtyping with coercion semantics allows a type inference system to
    correct some ill-typed programs by the automatic insertion of
    implicit type conversions at run-time. This simplifies programmer’s
    life but has its price: the general typability problem for given base
    type subtype dependencies is NP-complete.  Nevertheless, if the given
    coercions define an order on types with certain properties, the
    problem behaves in a sane way in terms of complexity.  This thesis
    presents an algorithm that can be used to extend Hindley-Milner type
    inference with coercive subtyping assuming a given partial order on
    base types. Especially, we discuss restrictions on the subtype
    dependencies that are necessary to achieve an efficient
    implementation. Examples of problems that occur if these restrictions
    are not met are given. The result of these considerations is that the
    algorithm is complete if the given base type poset is a disjoint union
    of lattices. Furthermore, the interaction of subtyping with type
    classes is addressed.  The algorithm that is extended to deal with
    type classes requires even a stronger restriction to assure
    completeness.  An ML-implementation of the presented algorithm is used
    in the generic proof assistant Isabelle.",

    treated by future historians of mathematics as a turning point.

    It is not easy to say precisely what we learnt in the meantime, if we
    learnt anything at all. I believe that the most important results are:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item we need experiments with much more advanced mathematics than
    already done
    \item a system for practical formalization of mathematics probably will
    not be a simple system based on small number of primitive notions
    \item integration with a computer algebra systems may be necessary or at
    least a feasible system must have bigger computational power. 
    \end{enumerate}

    Still we should me more concerned with the original ideas of de
    Bruijn, the most important that eventually we have to be able to
    formalize new mathematical results, published in mathematical

    enhancing the techniques available for mathematical experimentation,
    developing community standards for experiment and modelling and
    developing methods which will make computation more acceptable as part
    of a proof. We discuss three areas of research which address these:
    the use of theorem proving techniques to enhance or extend
    mathematical software systems, support for formal methods techniques
    to increase the reliability of such systems, and the use of computer
    aided formal reasoning in support of mathematical practice. This last
    includes activities such as formalizing systems for computational
    mathematics or visualization so that they can still be used informally
    but generate a formal development, and developing techniques to
    provide assistance in the initial stages of developing a new theory.

    By mathematics here we mean the activities of working research
    mathematicians, producing new results in pure or applied mathematics,
    although we touch briefly on some questions concerning the
    applications of computational mathematics and simulation in research
    science and engineering. We have left out several other related areas
    entirely: logical questions of decidability, soundness or
    completeness, theoretical computer science issues of semantics,
    computability or complexity, foundational issues such as
    constructivity, computer aided proofs about software and hardware, and
    the use of computers in mathematical education at all levels and in
    heuristic discovery. In particular foundational questions about
    computation have transformed mathematical logic, computation has made
    constructive proof feasible, and effective notions of practice for
    proofs about hardware and software are by no means well understood.

    "The programming language Alphard is designed to provide support for
    both the methodologies of ``well-structured'' programming and the
    techniques of formal program verification.  Language constructs allow
    a programmer to isolate an abstraction, specifying its behavior
    publicly while localizing.  knowledge about its implementation.  The
    verification of such an abstraction consists of showing that its
    implementation behaves in accordance with its public specifications;
    the abstraction can then be used with confidence in constructing
    other programs, and the verification of that use employs only the
    public specifications.  This paper introduces Alphard by developing
    and verifying a data structure definition and a program that uses it.
    It shows how each language construct contributes to the development of
    the abstraction and discusses the way the language design and the
    verification methodology wete tailored to each other.  It serves not
    only as an introduction to Alphard, but also as an example of the
    symbiosis between verification and methodology in language design.
    The strategy of program structuring, illustrated for Alphard, is
    also applicable to most of the ``data abstraction'' mechanisms now

    This paper presents an optimized method for factoring multivariate
    polynomials over algebraic extension fields which defined by an
    irreducible ascending set. The basic idea is to convert multivariate
    polynomials to univariate polynomials and algebraic extensions fields
    to algebraic number fields by suitable integer substitutions, then
    factorize the univariate polynomials over the algebraic number fields.
    Finally, construct multivariate factors of the original polynomial by
    Hensel lemma and TRUEFACTOR test. Some examples with timing are

    "Automated reasoning is one of the most established disciplines in
    informatics and artificial intelligence, and formal methods become
    increasingly employed in practical applications. However, for the most
    part, such applications seem to be limited to informatics-specific
    areas (e.g., the verification of correctness properties of software
    and hardware specifications) and areas close to informatics such as
    computational linguistics (e.g., the computation of consistence and
    informativeness properties of semantic representations). Naturally,
    there is also a potential for practical applications in the the area
    of mathematics: the generation of proofs for mathematically
    interesting and motivated theorems and, quite associated, the
    computer-supported formalisation of (parts of elementary)
    mathematics. It is a matter of fact, however, that mathematicians
    rarely use computer-support for the construction and verification of
    proofs. This is mainly caused by the “unnaturalness” of the language
    and the reasoning that such proof engines support.

    In the past, researchers in the area of automated reasoning have
    focused their work on formalisms and algorithms that allow the
    construction and verification of proofs that are written in a
    formal-logical language and that only use a limited number of
    inference rules. For the computer scientist, such formal proofs have
    the advantage of a simple and ambiguous-free syntax, which can thus be
    easily processed. Moreover, the limited number of inference rules has
    a direct impact on the complexity of the search space that needs to be
    conquered during the process of constructing proofs. The verification
    of given formal proofs is greatly facilitated by the complete
    explicitness of their logical argumentation where no reasoning step is
    left out.  For mathematicians, however, such formal proofs are usually
    hard to understand. For them, they are written in an unfamiliar and
    artificial language and much too detailed. Moreover, the sheer number
    of inference steps, while logically relevant, describe only trivial
    mathematical details and make it difficult to follow a proof’s main
    underlying argumentation line. In practise, thus, mathematicians use
    proof generation engines rather seldom, if at all. The same is true
    with regard to proof verification tools. The amount of work that is
    required to verify a mathematical proof with such tools is
    considerable, if not prohibitive. Since proof verification systems
    only accept formal proofs as input, the mathematician’s first task is
    to manually translate the mathematical proof into the formal language
    that is accepted by the verifier. This in turn includes the
    translation of the proof’s underlying mathematical argumentation into
    inference rules that are supported by the proof engine. Such
    translations and refinements are usually very time consuming, tedious,
    and prone to error themselves. Hence, how the proof verifier then
    judges the result of proof translation and proof refinement is only
    of limited relevance to the original mathematical proof. From the
    mathematician’s point of view, there is thus a need for a proof
    verification system that is capable of processing mathematical proofs
    automatically, at least with regard to translating the mathematicians’
    expert language into the system’s artificial formal language. Such a
    system would have an enormous potential in the community of
    mathematics, and this potential has been recognised early. In the
    beginning of the 1960s, John McCarthy, one of the pioneers of
    artificial intelligence, remarked that ``[c]hecking mathematical proofs
    is potentially one of the most interesting and useful applications of
    automatic computers'' [111]. More than forty years thereafter, a tool
    that supports mathematicians with the verification of mathematical
    proofs is more science fiction than reality. Its realisation is
    associated with research questions within the disciplines of automated
    reasoning and computational linguistics that are still only partially
    answered.

    This thesis aims at contributing towards the realisation of a
    verifier for mathematical proofs. It attempts to provide a general
    framework as well as an implementation for such a proof
    engine. The dissertation’s objects of study are short and simple
    proofs that were taken from textbooks on elementary number
    theory. Fig. 1 depicts a proof of the mathematical truth that
    every positive integer greater than 1 can be represented as a
    product of one or more primes. The proof consists of only a few
    lines and little mathematical knowledge is necessary to follow the
    proof author’s argumentation. It is this kind of short proof that
    we attempt to check automatically.",

    We give algorithms for the computation of the $d$-th digit of certain
    transcendental numbers in various bases. These algorithms can be
    easily implemented (multiple precision arithmetic is not needed),
    require virtually no memeory, and feature run times that scale nearly
    linearly with the order of the digit desired. They make it feasible to
    compute, for example, the billionth binary digit of log(2) or $\pi$ on
    a modest work station in a few hours run time.

    We demonstrate this technique by computing the ten billionth
    hexadecimal digit of $\pi$, the billionth hexadecimal digits of
    $\pi^2$, log(2), and log${}^2$(2), and the ten billionth decimal digit
    of log(9/10).

    These calculations rest on the observation that very special types of
    identities exist for certain numbers like $\pi$, $\pi^2$, log(2) and
    log${}^2$. These are essentially polylogarithmic ladders in an integer
    base. A number of these identities that we derive in this work appear
    to be new, for example the critical identity for $\pi$:

    \[\pi=\sum_{i=0}^\infty{\frac{1}{16^i}\left(
    \frac{4}{8i+1}-\frac{2}{8i+4}-\frac{1}{8i+5}-\frac{1}{8i+6}\right)}\]",
