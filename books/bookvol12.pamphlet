{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.

\chapter{Axiom Crystal Design}
\section{Book presentation}
In the book "Science at the Edge" by John Brockman
(ISBN 978-1-4027-5450-0),
in the chapter "The second coming -- A manifesto" by David Gelernter,
David talks about the way we interact with computers. This has some
bearing on the crystal notion.

\subsection{Book spines}
David points out that we currently have a "desktop metaphor" which
allows us to view our computer interactions as though we were moving
things around on a desktop, typically folders and documents. There are
several limitations of this metaphor.

The first is that there is a limited amount of space on the desktop.
He proposes the idea of a landscape where the computer is just a moving
window. This gives much more real estate to hold information.

The lack of desktop space leads to the icon idea to capture a small
representation of a document or folder. There are limitations to how
representative such a tiny image can be of the original. A book spine
is an excellent representation of the contents of a book but a tiny
picture of a folder, not so much.

If I look at this idea in terms of the Crystal concept I can
see two parallels. The first idea (desktop/icon) vs (landscape/book)
is related to the organization of Axiom. There is an ongoing effort
to organize the whole of the system into some small number of books.
The whole system is then somewhat similar to an encyclopedia where
there is a shelf of related information. 

Currently the algebra books are on the order of 5000 pages of raw
material. They will likely grow many times that size as literate
information is added. One website representation would show the
Axiom books as book-spines where the algebra section could be
broken up (visually, not actually) as encyclopedia-like images.
Thus, you would find the algebra "books" from A-C, D-F, etc.

\subsection{Linking information}

A second idea from the book is the limitations of the hierarchical
file system idea. Why does a particular file have to have a name?
Why does a particular file only live in one folder?

For the first question, he comments that if you had 3 dogs it is reasonable
to name them. But if you have 10,000 cows it probably is not. Some
information can be anonymous.

For the second question, he asks why doesn't a folder "grab" the 
information so that a particular file might not reside in multiple
folders. Unix has this idea embodied in links but Windows doesn't
support the idea.

He suggests that it might be reasonable to have the folders be active
so that a particular piece of information, say a travel receipt, might
be "grabbed" by the taxes folder and the travel expense folder.

Crystal's view of this is somewhat different. Information isn't named.
It resides in "the problem" floating in space. The naming of information
is related to the view. 

So if we take a problem in space, say all of your financial information
and wrap a crystal around it we can view it in multiple ways, each of
which represents a "facet". Moving between these views corresponds to
rotating the crystal to view "the problem" through a different facet.

So, in a financial crystal, you might have a taxes facet, a travel
expense facet, an assets facet, a checkbook facet, etc. A travel
receipt from a business trip which was added to "the problem' would
show up in all of these facets in different ways. It is up to the
facet to organize this piece of information into its proper place
based on the intent of the facet.

"The problem" just is. The meaning of the problem, the division of the
problem into parts, the naming of the parts, the organization of the
parts, indeed, the very idea that a problem has parts is a function of
the facet, not a function of the problem.

the associated 'answer' sub-div element.

\section{Understanding the Dynamics of Complex Lisp Programs \cite{9}}
{\bf Abstract}: Recent advances in web technologies and the
availability of robust Lisp libraries supporting them have made it
possible to think of new ways of understanding and debugging large
applications. In this paper, we will discuss two basic ideas for
assessing and verifying the behavior of Lisp programs. First, we
propose to use a web browser for graphically displaying debug output
in a similar but more versatile way as the Lisp listener is normally
used to print output traces. And second, we propose a method for
creating HTML visualisations of complex data and control structures
that don't trade in level of detail for readability. We will introduce
GTFL (a Graphical Terminal For Lisp), which we have implemented based
on these two ideas, and discuss its applications.

This paper is of interest, not for its lisp tracing output, but for
its ability to pipeline output to a browser and the technology that
underlies the whole of it.

GTFL uses Hunchentoot \cite{10} as a common lisp web server. It uses
CL-WHO \cite{11} as the Lisp/HTML markup language, HT-AJAX \cite{12}
as an AJAX framework. The combination of these tools with GTFL
\cite{13} allows nicely formatted output that the browser can
dynamically layout, expand, and contract.
