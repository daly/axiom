\begin{verbatim}

Spad typechecker is supposed to track type tests, and 
allow operation which are safe due to dynamic tests. 
However, tis works for 'if' but fails for loops, as in:

a:R
b:R
c:=a exquo b
while c case R repeat
  a:=c
  c:=a exquo b

Spad compiler report type error on assignment to a.

But both of these work:

a:R
b:R
c:=a exquo b
if c case R then
  while c case R repeat
    a:=c
    c:=a exquo b

and 

a:R
b:R
c:=a exquo b
while c case R repeat
  if c case R then
    a:=c

in terms of radicals.

According to the AXIOM Book

However, already for z^7 = 1 this is not so,

   [z= 1]

and the problem exists for 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 etc

-------------- comments

Of course, these are correct solutions by Euler's Formula. A bit
surprising that radicalSolve invokes these for z^7=2 and not for
z^7=1; when n is 7, these trignometric values are not embeddable in a
tower of "solvable" extensions. That is, these are not solutions
expressible in terms of radicals (of *real* numbers) and arithmetic
alone. Put another way, the regular 7-gon is not constructible by
compass and ruler alone. From:

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConstructiblePolygon.html
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrigonometryAngles.html

A necessary and sufficient condition that a regular n-gon be
constructible is that phi(n) be a power of 2, where phi(n) is the
totient function (Krzek 2001, p. 34).

n =  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17 18 19 20
phi= 1  1  2  2  4  2  6  4  6   4  10   4  12   6   8   8  16  6 18  8
bad=                   x     x       x       x   x              x  x
Vladimir's "not good" values are =

n =                    7            11      13  14  15      17    19

So if you compare the constructible regular n-gons, you can see why
Axiom's results are reasonable: radicalSolve only finds solutions that
are expressible in terms of radicals and arithmetic operations. It did
not find those for n = 15 and 17 probably (I am guessing) because at
the time of implementation, these constructions were not known (at
least to the programmer). On the other hand, for n = 9, 18, the
solutions are expressible in radicals only if radicals of *complex*
numbers are allowed and Axiom found those (perhaps it shouldn't?). The
expansion for (-1)^(1/7) that Vladimir gave involves radicals of
complex numbers, as theory predicts.


When Axiom cannot find solutions, it is (presumably) a PROOF that the
other solutions are NOT solvable by radicals (using *real* numbers),
or at least, there is no known proof that it is solvable at the time
of implementation=2E (That is why I am surprised at the above result
for z^7=2).

In other words, rather than viewing the answer for z^7=1 as a bug, we should
view the answers for z^7=2, z^7=3 (and may be even z^9=1, z^18=1) as bugs!

Still, the package should be upgraded.

The error apparently comes from EXPR where the implementation is
  x**y == exp(y * log(x))

so exp^log(x) is computed as
 
  exp(log(x) * log(exp))

which should be ok, but then the system handles log exp and tries to
simplify it to the identity map, and not finding the argument.

could you please file this as a bug on issuetracker? The problem is in the
operation "argument":

(8) -> argument(%i)

        %pi
   (8)  ---
         2
                                                     Type: Expression Integer

                                                     Type: Expression Integer

the latter should be -pi/2, of course. The problem is in gaussian.spad,
COMPCAT:

       if R has TranscendentalFunctionCategory then
         half := recip(2::R)::R

         if R has RealNumberSystem then
           atan2loc(y: R, x: R): R ==
               pi1 := pi()$R
               pi2 := pi1 * half
               x = 0 => if y >= 0 then pi2 else -pi2

               -- Atan in (-pi/2,pi/2]
               theta := atan(y * recip(x)::R)
               while theta <= -pi2 repeat theta := theta + pi1
               while theta >   pi2 repeat theta := theta - pi1

               x >= 0 => theta      -- I or IV

               if y >= 0 then
                   theta + pi1      -- II
               else
                   theta - pi1      -- III

           argument x == atan2loc(imag x, real x)

         else
           -- Not ordered so dictate two quadrants
           argument x ==
             zero? real x => pi()$R * half
             atan(imag(x) * recip(real x)::R)

so the problem occurs if R does not have "RealNumberSystem":

(15) -> argument(-%i*1.0)

   (15)  - 1.5707963267 948966192

since Float does have RNS, but INT does not. I'm not quite sure what the
condition should be. OrderedSet?

Does exponential operation ``\verb|^|'' and ``\verb|**|'' of a differential
operator, say L, means repeating multiplications of L in Axiom ? If
so, it seems the following code produced an unexpected result:

need to know the extension in advance, and I don't see a way to factor

rather good implementation, too.

      map_!((z:L):L+->opeval(z,r), recurfactor(op1, dd, zeros, ezfactor, adj?))

Waldek claims this should read:

    rfactor(op, r, zeros, ezfactor, adj?) ==
      recurfactor(op, r, zeros, ezfactor, adj?)

Martin comments:

 I reworked lodof.input into the unittest framework, including 
 additionally a simplified version of the bug and a new product of two
 irreducible degree 2 factors, which fails, of course. Unfortunately,
 your patched rfactor seems to go into an infinite loop with

-- reducible order 3 operator (1-1-1)
testFactor [(t^9 + t^3)*d +(-sqrt 91+7)*t^8+(-sqrt 91 + 1)*t^2,_
            d + ((sqrt 91 + 6)*t^6 + sqrt 91)/(t^7+t),_
            d + (5*t^6 - 1)/(t^7 + t)]

Waldek comments:

 The real problem seems to be that

 op2 := (t^9+t^3)*d^2 + (13*t^8+t^2)*d - 55*t^7 - 91*t
 factor(op2)

 is extremely slow. I am looking at this -- one problem is
 that we spend a lot of time computing gcd-s of polynomials
 with algebraic coefficients

Maybe I should have added why rootsOf(2*z^4 + z^3 - z - 2) is wrong:
2z^4+z^3-z-2=(z^2-1)(2*z^2+z+2),
thus no two roots are equal, contrary to axioms result.

I disagree with the previous comment; x should be captured and not
allowed in the FRAC POLY INT. (I agree that the second example in the
original report is not a bug.)

But surely we can all agree that 
integrate((1/x)::ULS(FRAC POLY INT,x, 0),x) 
is a bug? The problem is the same: the 1/x is being treated
in the coefficient domain. Note that 
integrate(1/(x::ULS(FRAC POLYINT, x, 0)),x) 
produces a correct result.

Dylan (dpt@math.harvard.edu)

Sat 02 Oct 2004 08:33:01 AM GMT, comment #1:

Neither of these is a bug. In the first one, Axiom coerced 1/x into
FRAC POLY INT correctly: the only / operation available in UTS is one
induced from the coefficient domain, which requires the denominator to
be in the coefficient domain, and the division is done termwise to the
coefficients of the series. So 1/x ends up in FRAC POLY INT. Note that
to obtain a Taylor series at x = 0 is mathematically is wrong, since
1/x is not defined at x=0. Also the way to obtain a Taylor series is
taylor(func, x=a). If you do integrate(taylor(1/x,x=1),x), that would
cause no problems. Note that the domain of this command is UTS(EXPR
INT, x,1), so such towers are valid and necessary in Axiom. Note also
there are only two exported[coerce] in UTS and they do NOT apply to
1/x. The x in UTS is like the x in UP and is different from the x in
FRAC POLY INT. The representation is Stream Coef (no variable
specified because it is univariate).

For the same reason, in the second command, 1/y is correctly coerced
into FRAC POLY INT. However, in UTS(,x,), the only integrations
allowed are with respect to x. If you want to do integration in 
FRAC POLY INT, then you should do so without coercing 1/y into UTS.

So your examples do not illustrate the problem about mixed up
variables. In fact, it supports use of towers like UTS(EXPR INT, x,a).

Cause:
In EXPR INT, 2^a and 2^(2*a) are treated as two variables without
relatoins in EXPR INT. Therefore exquo in
gcdPrimitive(p1:SUPP,p2:SUPP)$PGCD fails.

>> Sorry, this is not correct. It is in FIELD (for EXPR INT)

Excuse me, I was to quick again. Here is the (hopefully correct) anaylysis:

exquo(simplify((A-2^a)*(A+2^a))::UP(A,EXPR INT),(A-2^a)::UP(A,EXPR INT))

calls exquo$SUP(EXPR INT). This implements exact division of
polynomials p1 by p2 as usual. After each subtraction - done via
fmecg$SUP - the result is again stored in p1. exquo terminates when p1
is the empty list - note that SUPs are stored as lists of pairs
(degree, coefficient) - or the degree of p2 is larger than p1. In the
latter case, exquo fails.

Thus, in our case, at one point p1 is 4^a-2^(2*a), which is zero
mathematically, but axiom does not know it. In particular, p1 is not
the empty list, but rather a constant polynomial...

It would be interesting to see how MuPAD or Aldor handle this.

I'm afraid that this cannot be fixed easily, since there is no general
mechanism to determine whether an expression is zero or not, which is
needed in exquo. The instance of exquo involved is the one in SMP.

todo 318: do a plucker/grassman example

Hi,

The Grassmannian G(d,n) is the set of all d-dimensional subspaces of
k^n. Such a subspace can be represented as a d*n matrix whose d rows
are a basis for the subspace. The d*d minors of this matrix are the
Plucker coordinates for the subspace, which gives an embedding of the
the Grassmannian into projective space.

(For example, a 2-dimensional subspace of k^4 can be represented as a
2*4 matrix, and the minors are the determinants of the 2*2 matrices we
get by taking pairs of columns 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34. The values of
these minors can be used for form a point [p12:p13:p14:p23:p24:p34] in
projective 5-space, where pij is the ijth Plucker coordinate.)

It is claimed that the Grassmannian is a variety - in other words, the
zero set of a set of polynomials. How do I go about listing these
polynomials (ie generators for the ideal), in terms of the Plucker
coordinates? (In other words, what relations must hold between the
minors of a matrix, given that the rows are linearly independent?)

(I'm aware that there's a way to think about this in terms of the
exterior algebra, but I'm hoping that there's a more straightforward
way to see it.)

Thanks, David

I don't know if this helps, but such a generating set can be computed
explicitly for fixed (d,n). One uses an elimination order on
polynomials of the form {y1-p1,y2-p2,...} and the result comprises
polynomial relations between the yj.

Here is code for this in Mathematica. It is simple enough that it
should not be too hard to translate to other languages if so desired
(I mean by you; I do not intend to do that).

  {x, xmat, y, yvars, pcoords},

I note that use of Minors probably changes ordering of the p_jk minors
from what you have in mind, so the order of the y variables would need
to be altered accordingly.

Well, that is what I was going to mention.  It is also the source of the
Pluecker coordinates.  A k-plane in R^n is a unit, decomposable k-vector
in \Lambda_k (R^n).  For G(2,n), the relationship is simpler than for
larger subspace dimensions, because a bivector \xi \in \Lambda_2 (R^n)
is decomposable if and only if \xi \wedge \xi = 0.  You can then write
that out explicitly as equations in the coordinates in \Lambda_2 (R^n),
and they will be quadratics.  For k>2, certainly \xi \wedge \xi =0, but
that is not sufficient for \xi to be decomposable.  Instead, the kernel
of the map R^n --> \Lambda_(k+1) (R^n) given by v --> \xi \wedge v  has
to be k-dimensional, but that still is polynomial in the coordinates.

 From that description, though, it is not clear that G(2,n) is smooth,
and of the right dimension, since it is not a complete intersection, but
of course it is.

Ah yes, thanks, that should have been obvious.

However, that still leaves a couple of questions:

- Clearly the Grassmannian is contained in the zero-set of those
relations, but how do we know that they coincide? That is, how do we
know that there aren't other zeroes of those relations, which are not
the image of a d*n matrix under the Pluecker embedding.

- Is there any way we could have written down the relations a priori,
without Groebner basis computations (and without exterior algebra)?

Because of the nature of the Pluecker embedding.  These coordinates are
  only the exterior algebra with respect to an explicit basis.  In
particular, as Lichtblau wrote, in the case of 2-planes, the condition
\xi \wedge \xi = 0 is exactly equivalent to \xi being decomposable, \xi
= v \wedge w.  In higher dimensions the conditions are more complicated,
but nevertheless completely describe the Grassmannian.

I can't imagine it, but I also can't imagine why you would want it.
Exterior algebra is the natural setting for this question.  For the
price of making sense of the mechanics, it clarifies exactly these
relationships and makes clear what the relations are.

Perhaps the problem is that I don't understand the connection between
the exterior algebra description of the Grassmannian and the Plucker
coordinates (matrix minors) description. Please can someone spell it
out.

The matrix minors are the coefficients of the exterior products
of the basis elements.

So let v, w be vectors in C^4, and consider the
wedge product v^w. It can be expanded in terms of the standard basis
e_i^e_j, for i<j of the second exterior power of C^4, where e_i are
the standard basis vectors of C^4. Just write it
out and you will see the 2x2 minors appear. In some detail:
v=v_1e_1+v_2e_2+v_3e_3+v_4e_4, w=w_1e_1+w_2e_2+w_3e_3+w_4e_4,
so
v^w=(v_1w_2-v_2w_1) e_1^e_2 + ......

The pattern still holds for k vectors in C^n.

Hope that helps.

\subsection{meh 3: from Bill Page}
\begin{verbatim}

I just wanted to mention something here that I just learned about how
the Axiom interpreter handles option arguments. When discovering how
the 'draw' operations in Axiom processes optional arguments, e.g.

  draw(sin(x), x=1..10, title=="sin function")

I realized the interpreter does something rather clever but probably
quite unexpected. The problem is that (unlike Aldor) SPAD does not
provide built-in support for calling functions with optional
arguments. Instead what it does is collect all the arguments
containing == into a List *and* then it applies the name to the left
of == as a function to the value on the right. So much to my surprize:

(1) -> (x+->x)(sin==x,cos==y)

   (1)  [sin(x),cos(y)]

                                  Type: List Expression Integer

is equivalent to:

(2) -> (x+->x)([sin(x),cos(y)])

   (2)  [sin(x),cos(y)]

                                   Type: List Expression Integer

The list of optional arguments is always passed as the last argument
to the function. This is completely general so one can write for
example:

(3) -> ((x,y)+->[x,y])(sin==x,n,cos==y)

   (3)  [n,[sin(x),cos(y)]]

                                     Type: List Any

What do you think? Do you like that, or is this something that should
be implemented in a deeper way?

The reason is that the List functor is defined
to have a coercion to OutputForm only if its argument
is of tyep SetCategory. This is clearly wrong. There is
no reason to associate prettyprinting with SetCategory 
membership.

changing the signature line to read:
   foo(): SetCategory with

1) the patch correct problem in goodCoef, there are other bugs in
   integrator, I will work on them separately.
2) AFAICS goodCoef is an optimization, it should be safe to return
   "failed" always (but since we take different path in the other
   part we hit different bugs).  I tried to preserve optimization
   done by goodCoef whenever it is safe.
3) I would like to use higher level constructs, but I keept hitting
   into problems with SPAD compiler, so finally I used a rather low
   level way
4) without the patch the AXIOM recurses infinitely handling the 
   few integrals below (first I previosly gave in the bug report).
   With the patch the first two are correctly handled, the other
   two quickly hit into unimplemented part of Risch algorithm:

Waldek: iprint is used to print (regular) triangular sets.
  Unconditional flush defeats buffering optimizations, so IMHO
  it should be done only for some streams (for example streams
  connected to terminals).
  Flushing output should be done when the outupt is complete,
  while iprint clearly is used to compose bigger units from small parts.
Tim: unless the princ contains a newline there is no guarantee that
  the output will appear. if the output is intended to be a prompt,
  for instance, which does not contain a newline then the flush
  is needed to force the output to appear.
  Deleting the call to flush breaks the existing semantics of the package.

   binomial(n, m) ==
      n < 0 or m < 0 or m > n => 0

Of course, here [[n]] and [[m]] are integers. This definition agrees with the
recurrence

$$\binom{n}{k}+\binom{n}{k+1}=\binom{n+1}{k+1}.$$

Alternatively, one can use the formula
$$ \binom{n}{k}=\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(k+1)\Gamma(n-k+1)}, $$
and leave the case where $k\in\mathbb Z$, $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $k \leq n < 0$
undefined, since the limit does not exist in this case:

Since we then have that $n-k+1\geq 1$, $\Gamma(n-k+1)$ is finite. So it is
sufficient to consider $\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(k+1)}$. On the one hand, we
have
$$\lim_{n_0\to n} \lim_{k_0\to k}\frac{\Gamma(n_0+1)}{\Gamma(k_0+1)} = 0,$$
since for any non-integral $n_0$, $\Gamma(n_0+1)$ is finite. On the other
hand,
$$\lim_{k_0\to k} \lim_{n_0\to n}\frac{\Gamma(n_0+1)}{\Gamma(k_0+1)}$$
does not exist, since for non-integral $k_0$, $\Gamma(k_0+1)$ is finite while
$\Gamma(n_0+1)$ is unbounded.

However, since for $k\in\mathbb Z$, $n\in\mathbb Z$ and $0 < k < n$ both
definitions agree, one could also combine them. This is what, for example,
Mathematica does. It seems that MuPAD sets [[binomial(n,n)=1]] for all
arguments [[n]], and returns [[binomial(-2, n)]] unevaluated. Provisos may help
here.
