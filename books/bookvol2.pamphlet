{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.

\section{Makefile}
This book is actually a literate program\cite{2} and can contain 
executable source code. In particular, the Makefile for this book
is part of the source of the book and is included below. Axiom 
uses the ``noweb'' literate programming system by Norman Ramsey\cite{6}.
\chapter{Writing Spad Code}
\section{The Description: label and the )describe command}
The describe command will print out the comments associated with Axiom
source code elements. For the category, domain, and package sections
the text is taken from the Description: keyword.

This information is stored in a database and can be queried with
\begin{verbatim}
  )lisp (getdatabase '|Integer| 'documentation)
\end{verbatim}
for the Integer domain. However, this information has other uses in 
the system so it contains tags and control information. Most tags are
removed by the describe function since the output is intended to be
displayed in ASCII on the terminal.

The Description: keyword is in the comment block just after the 
abbreviation command. It is freeform and the paragraph will be reflowed
automatically to allow for about 60 characters per line, adjusted for
spaces. The Description: section should be written after the keyword in
the ``++'' comments as in:
\begin{verbatim}
)abbrev package D03AGNT d03AgentsPackage
++ Description:
++ This package does some interesting stuff. We can write multiple
++ lines but they should all line up with the first character of
++ the Description keyword. Special \spad{terms} will be removed.
++
++ The above line will force a newline. So will ending a line with \br
++ \tab{5}This will allow primitive formatting\br
++ \tab{5}So you can align text\br
++ \tab{10}Start in column 11\tab{5}and skip 5 spaces\br
++ \tab{10}End in column 11\tab{7}and count out the needed spaces\br
++ \tab{5} note that the last line will not need the br command
\end{verbatim}
As the comment says, the Description should all be aligned under the
``D'' in Description. You can indent using \verb|\tab{n}| which will insert
$n$ spaces. You can force a newline in two ways. Either include a
blank line (with the ``++'' comments) or use the \verb|\br| keyword.

Due to lousy parsing algorithms for comments there are various ways this
can all go wrong. 

There should not be any macros between the Description: section and
the beginning of the definition. This is wrong. It will cause the
\begin{verbatim}
   )describe package d03AgentsPackage
\end{verbatim}
to give the wrong output because it does not find the end of the
description section properly.
\begin{verbatim}
)abbrev package D03AGNT d03AgentsPackage
++ Description:
++ This description does not work

LEDF  ==> List Expression DoubleFloat

d03AgentsPackage(): E == I where
\end{verbatim}

In the Description: section the \verb|\tab{nn}| function will be transformed
into nn spaces. If you end each line with a \verb|\br| you can control
alignment.
\begin{verbatim}
++ Description:
++ This is an example of a table alignment\br
++ \tab{5}First Item\tab{5} This will line up with the following line\br
++ \tab{5}Second Item\tab{4} This will line up with the following line\br
++ \tab{5}Third Item\tab{5} This will line up with the following line
\end{verbatim}

If the main body of the category, domain, or package begins with 
properties rather than functions the Description will be incorrectly
recorded. This is a known bug finding the end of the Description section.
For instance, this
\begin{verbatim}
++ Description:
++ The category of Lie Algebras.
++ It is used by the domains of non-commutative algebra,
++ LiePolynomial and XPBWPolynomial. 

LieAlgebra(R: CommutativeRing): Category ==  Module(R) with
    NullSquare 
      ++ \axiom{NullSquare} means that \axiom{[x,x] = 0} holds.
    JacobiIdentity 
      ++ \axiom{JacobiIdentity} means that 
      ++ \axiom{[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]] = 0} holds.
    construct:  ($,$) -> $
      ++ \axiom{construct(x,y)} returns the Lie bracket of \axiom{x} 
      ++ and \axiom{y}.
\end{verbatim}
will give the output
\begin{verbatim}
{JacobiIdentity} means that} [x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]] = 0 holds.
\end{verbatim}
but reordering it to read:
\begin{verbatim}
++ Description:
++ The category of Lie Algebras.
++ It is used by the domains of non-commutative algebra,
++ LiePolynomial and XPBWPolynomial. 

LieAlgebra(R: CommutativeRing): Category ==  Module(R) with
    construct:  ($,$) -> $
      ++ \axiom{construct(x,y)} returns the Lie bracket of \axiom{x} 
      ++ and \axiom{y}.
    NullSquare 
      ++ \axiom{NullSquare} means that \axiom{[x,x] = 0} holds.
    JacobiIdentity 
      ++ \axiom{JacobiIdentity} means that 
      ++ \axiom{[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]] = 0} holds.
\end{verbatim}
will give the output
\begin{verbatim}
The category of Lie Algebras. It is used by the domains of 
non-commutative algebra, LiePolynomial and XPBWPolynomial. 
\end{verbatim}
which is correct.
