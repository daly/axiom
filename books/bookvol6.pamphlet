{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.

\chapter{Overview}
The axiom system consists of a set of processes managed by the
superman process.  The superman process, called sman, is normally
invoked from the axiom shell script in order to start a tree of
subprocesses.

The {\tt axiom} command is a shell script that collects the 
command line options for the {\tt sman} process, sets some shell
variables, and then invokes {\tt sman}. 

The {\tt sman} process starts the following tree of processes:
\begin{verbatim}
     --xterm---bash---sman-|-AXIOMsys
                           |-clef---spadclient
                           |-hypertex
                           |-session
                           |-sman
                           |-viewman
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{The axiom Command}
The {\tt axiom} command starts everything for Axiom. The options
for the {\tt axiom} command are:
\begin{verbatim}
axiom
  [-ht    |-noht]      whether to use HyperDoc
  [-gr    |-nogr]      whether to use Graphics
  [-clef  |-noclef]    whether to use Clef
  [-nonag |-nag]       whether to use NAG
  [-noiw  |-iw]        start in interpreter in a separate window
  [-ihere |-noihere]   start an interpreter in this window
  [-nox]               don't use X Windows
  [-go  |-nogo]        whether to start system
  [-ws wsname]         use named workspace
  [-list]              list workspaces only
  [-grprog fname]      use named program for Graphics
  [-nagprog fname]     use named program for Nag
  [-htprog fname]      use named program for HyperDoc
  [-clefprog fname]    use named program for Clef
  [-sessionprog fname] use named program for session
  [-clientprog fname]  use named program for spadclient
  [-h]                 show usage
\end{verbatim}

In detail, the command options are:
\subsection{[-ht $\vert$ -noht]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-ht    |-noht]      whether to use HyperDoc
\end{verbatim}
{\tt Hyperdoc}\cite{7} is the documentation tool for Axiom. The
{\tt -ht} option, enabled by default, will start this tool.
See Jenks\cite{1} Chapter 3 for further information on the 
{\tt hyperdoc} subsystem.

\subsection{[-gr $\vert$ -nogr]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-gr    |-nogr]      whether to use Graphics
\end{verbatim}
The {\tt graphics}\cite{8} subsystem is enabled using the 
{\tt -gr} option, enabled by default. Graphics will appear as a
result of a draw command, such as
\begin{verbatim}
 draw(sin(x),x=0..1)
\end{verbatim}
Note that attempting to use draw commands when the graphics is
disabled will simply hang the interpreter waiting for a response.
See Jenks\cite{1} Chapter 7 for further information on the 
{\tt graphics} subsystem.

\subsection{[-clef $\vert$ -noclef]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-clef  |-noclef]    whether to use Clef
\end{verbatim}
The {\tt clef} (Command Line Edit Facility) allows for command completion.
The list of command completion strings is in the last chapter of this
document. If {\tt clef}, enabled by default, is running then you can type:
\begin{verbatim}
 x:Dena<tab>
\end{verbatim}
and this will automatically be expanded to:
\begin{verbatim}
 x:DenavitHartenbergMatrix
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt clef} program also allows command line editing. The commands are
special keyboard keys.
\begin{itemize}
\item HOME move to beginning of the line
\item END move to the end of the line
\item CTRL-END delete to end of the line
\item TAB command completion (multiple tabs give new choices)
\item UPARROW move back thru commands
\item DOWNARROW move forward thru commands
\item LEFTARROW move left on the line
\item RIGHTARROW move right on the line
\item INSERT toggle insert/overstrike
\end{itemize}
See Jenks\cite{1} page 21 for further information on the {\tt clef} command.

\subsection{[-nonag $\vert$ -nag]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-nonag |-nag]       whether to use NAG
\end{verbatim}
The {\tt nag} option, disabled by default, will attempt to start
the {\tt nagman} program in the \$AXIOM/lib subdirectory. Since
the open source version does not include the NAG numeric libraries
this option does not work.

\subsection{[-noiw $\vert$ -iw]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-noiw  |-iw]        start in interpreter in a separate window
\end{verbatim}
The {\tt iw} option, disabled by default, will start a second
interpreter in its own window with its own frame. The fact that
the second interpreter is in its own frame can be seen using the
{\tt )frame} command. For instance, if you type
\begin{verbatim}
 axiom -iw
\end{verbatim}
there will be two interpreter windows available, one in the current
window and one in a new window. In the current window if you type:
\begin{verbatim}
 )frame names
\end{verbatim}
you will see:
\begin{verbatim}
   The names of the existing frames are:
            frame0 
            frame1 
            initial 
      The current frame is the first one listed.
\end{verbatim}

In the second window, if you type
\begin{verbatim}
 )frame names
\end{verbatim}
you will see:
\begin{verbatim}
   The names of the existing frames are:
            frame1 
            frame0 
            initial 
      The current frame is the first one listed.
\end{verbatim}
Setting
\begin{verbatim}
 x:=3
\end{verbatim}
in the second window will set the variable $x$ in the frame {\tt frame1}.
Switching to the first window and typing:
\begin{verbatim}
 x
\end{verbatim}
gives:
\begin{verbatim}

   (1)  x
                             Type: Variable x
\end{verbatim}
since the first window is in {\tt frame0} and the variable $x$ is
defined in {\tt frame1}.
But we can switch frames in the first window using
\begin{verbatim}
 )frame next
\end{verbatim}
and then
\begin{verbatim}
 x
\end{verbatim}
gives:
\begin{verbatim}

   (2)  3
                             Type: PositiveInteger
\end{verbatim}
and now the two windows share the same frame space. 
See Jenks\cite{1} page 579 for further information on the {\tt frame} command.

\subsection{[-ihere $\vert$ -noihere]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-ihere |-noihere]   start an interpreter in this window
\end{verbatim}
This option determines whether Axiom will start in the current window.
Using this option alone is not particularly useful and it is generally
used in combination with the {\tt -iw} option:
\begin{verbatim}
 axiom -noihere -iw &
\end{verbatim}

However, used alone, as in:
\begin{verbatim}
 axiom -noihere &
\end{verbatim}
it will start Axiom and show the Hyperdoc window. Graphics will also
work from the Hyperdoc pages.

\subsection{[-nox]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-nox]               don't use X Windows
\end{verbatim}
allows Axiom to start the interpreter without Hyperdoc or the graphics
subsystem. This is useful for starting Axiom in an emacs buffer.

\subsection{[-go $\vert$ -nogo]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-go  |-nogo]        whether to start system
\end{verbatim}
uses the {\tt -go} option, enabled by default, controls whether
the system starts from the command line. If the {\tt -nogo}
option is chosen the system prints the command line that would
have been issued. This is useful for finding out what the command
line options to {\tt sman} will be. For instance:
\begin{verbatim}
 axiom -nogo -iw
\end{verbatim}
does not start Axiom but types out:
\begin{verbatim}
Would now start the processes.
exec ~/mnt/linux/bin/sman -iw -ws ~/mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{[-ws wsname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-ws wsname]         use named workspace
\end{verbatim}
In the {\tt -nogo} command above you can see that the default
workspace name is 
\begin{verbatim}
-ws ~/mnt/linux/bin/AXIOMsys
\end{verbatim}
This option allows you to change that. This is useful for
debugging new system builds. During build a debugging version
of Axiom is created in the {\tt obj/linux/bin} directory. The
{\tt debugsys} image uses interpreted lisp code rather than
compiled code. This makes it possible to do deep debugging. To
use this workspace you would incant:
\begin{verbatim}
 cd youraxiombuild
 export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/linux
 export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
 axiom -ws obj/linux/bin/debugsys
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{[-list]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-list]              list workspaces only
\end{verbatim}
shows you the executable workspaces. Generally in a built system
there is only one, called\\
{\tt \$AXIOM/bin/AXIOMsys}.

\subsection{[-grprog fname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-grprog fname]      use named program for Graphics
\end{verbatim}
allows you to specify which program to use for the graphics.
By default this is\\
{\tt \$AXIOM/lib/viewman}.

\subsection{[-nagprog fname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-nagprog fname]     use named program for Nag
\end{verbatim}
allows you to specify which program to use for the NAG library
connection. By default this is\\
{\tt \$AXIOM/lib/nagman} but it is disabled by default.

\subsection{[-htprog fname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-htprog fname]      use named program for Hyperdoc
\end{verbatim}
allows you tp specify which program to use for Hyperdoc. By
default it is\\
{\tt \$AXIOM/bin/hypertex -s}.

\subsection{[-clefprog fname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-clefprog fname]    use named program for Clef
\end{verbatim}
allows you to specify which program to use for clef. By default
it is\\ 
{\tt \$AXIOM/bin/clef -f \$AXIOM/lib/command.list -e}.

\subsection{[-sessionprog fname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-sessionprog fname] use named program for session
\end{verbatim}
allows you to specify the session manager program. By default it is\\
{\tt \$AXIOM/lib/session}.

\subsection{[-clientprog fname]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-clientprog fname]  use named program for spadclient
\end{verbatim}
allows you to specify the spadclient program. By default it is\\
{\tt \$AXIOM/lib/spadclient}.

\subsection{[-h]}
\begin{verbatim}
  [-h]                 show usage
\end{verbatim}

\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
#!/bin/sh

\end{chunk}
The {\tt MALLOCTYPE} shell variable is an {\tt IBM} {\tt AIX}
shell variable that controls buckets based extensions in the default
memory allocator which may enhance performance. AIX uses a new
memory management routine that does not zero {\tt malloc} memory
and does not round up to the nearest power of 2, unlike most non-AIX
systems. This can cause failures so we protect against that here.
See the AIX Performance Tuning Guide\cite{9} for details.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}

MALLOCTYPE=3.1
export MALLOCTYPE

\end{chunk}
The {\tt nagman} process needs to know the hostname
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
HOST=`hostname`
export HOST

\end{chunk}
There are 4 basic utilities used by this script.
The {\tt ciao} script for immediate exit:
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
ciao() {
	echo "Goodbye."
	exit 1
}

\end{chunk}
The {\tt needsubopt} script which is used to issue an error message
when one of the command line options requires an option:
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
needsubopt () {
	echo "The $1 option requires an argument."
	ciao
}
\end{chunk}
The {\tt showuse} script which gives basic command line help:
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
showuse() {
echo "axiom"
echo "  [-ht    |-noht]      whether to use HyperDoc"
echo "  [-gr    |-nogr]      whether to use Graphics"
echo "  [-clef  |-noclef]    whether to use Clef"

echo "  [-h]                 show usage"
}

\end{chunk}
List the various workspaces if asked.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
listwspaces()
{
        echo "$1"
        ls -l $2 | grep "sys$"
        echo ""
}

\end{chunk}
Step 1. Ensure the environment is set.

Just process ``-h''. If it exists in the command line then we
print out the simple command line help menu.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}

if [ "$*" = "-h" ] ; then
     showuse
fi
\end{chunk}

We assume that Axiom is installed in the standard place on
a linux system. We will modify this assumption as we process
the environment and command line. The term {\tt spad} is an
historical shortened version of the name {\tt scratchpad},
the original name of the {\tt Axiom} system.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
SPADDEFAULT=/usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux

\end{chunk}
If the {\tt \$AXIOM} shell variable is set then we use it.\\
If not, then if the {\tt \$SPAD} shell variable is set then we use it.\\
If not, then we try to use the default value above.\\
If not, we simply fail.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
if [ "$SPAD" = "" ] ; then
  if [ "$AXIOM" = "" ] ; then
    SPAD=$SPADDEFAULT
    echo "AXIOM variable is not set"
    echo "assuming AXIOM = $SPAD"
    AXIOM=$SPAD
    export AXIOM
  else
    SPAD=$AXIOM
  fi
  export SPAD
else
  if [ "$AXIOM" = "" ] ; then
    echo "AXIOM variable is not set"
    echo "but SPAD = $SPAD"
    echo "Using AXIOM = $SPAD"
    AXIOM=$SPAD
    export AXIOM
  else
    if [ ! "$SPAD" = "$AXIOM" ] ; then
       echo "ignoring SPAD variable"
       SPAD=$AXIOM
    fi
  fi
fi

\end{chunk}
If we get here then all attempts to find axiom have failed
so we complain and exit.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
if [ ! -d "$SPAD" ] ; then
  echo "The directory for Axiom, $SPAD, does not exist."
  ciao
fi

\end{chunk}
Step 2. Process command line arguments.

Name the workspace directories
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
rootwsdir=$SPAD/bin

\end{chunk}

We set up the defaults for command-line arguments.
We don't want just a list by default
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
list=no

\end{chunk}
We default to actually executing the workspace.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
go=yes

\end{chunk}
We default to the {\tt AXIOMsys} workspace.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
wsname=AXIOMsys

\end{chunk}
And all other options are unset.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
otheropts=""

\end{chunk}
For each option on the command line do
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
while [ "$*" != "" ] ; do
\end{chunk}
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}

	case $1 in
\end{chunk}
If the user specified list anywhere then we give the workspace list
and exit.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}

        -list)  list=yes
                go=no;;
\end{chunk}
If the user specified {\tt go} or {\tt nogo} we handle that case
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
	-go)	go=yes ;;
	-nogo)	go=no ;;

\end{chunk}
The workspace option requires an argument which follows immediately.
If the argument is missing we complain and exit.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
	-ws)
		if [ "$2" = "" ] ; then needsubopt "$1" ; fi
		shift
		wsname="$1"
		;;

\end{chunk}
We can specify the various subprograms to use.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
	-nagprog|-grprog|-htprog|-clefprog|-sessionprog|-clientprog)
		if [ "$2" = "" ] ; then needsubopt "$1" ; fi
		otheropts="$otheropts  $1 $2"
		shift
		;;
\end{chunk}
These options were not explained earlier and are only for developer use.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
        -paste|-rm|-rv)
		if [ "$2" = "" ] ; then needsubopt "$1" ; fi
		otheropts="$otheropts  $1 $2"
		shift
		;;
\end{chunk}
We handle the various [{\tt -option} $\vert$ {\tt -nooption}] cases
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
	-clef|-noclef|-gr|-nogr|-ht|-noht|-iw|-noiw)
		otheropts="$otheropts $1"
		;;
        -ihere|-noihere|-nox|-nag|-nonag)
		otheropts="$otheropts $1"
		;;
\end{chunk}
The user wanted help so we will not execute.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
	-h)
		go=no
		;;
\end{chunk}
The user is confused. Complain and exit.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
	*)	echo "Unknown option: $1"
		echo "To use a specific workspace use, e.g.: spad -ws $1"
		ciao
		;;
	esac
\end{chunk}
Move to the next option and loop.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}

	shift
done

\end{chunk}
Step 3. Handle options that require special case handling.

The user just wanted to know what workspaces are available.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
if [ $list = yes ] ; then
 listwspaces "AXIOM workspaces in \$AXIOM/bin = $rootwsdir: " $rootwsdir
fi

\end{chunk}
Try to ensure a suitable workspace on this host.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
if [ `expr $wsname : '.*/.*'` = 0 ] ; then
	serverws=$rootwsdir/$wsname
else
	serverws=$wsname
fi
\end{chunk}
If we can't find the executable then we complain and exit.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}

if [ ! -x $serverws ] ; then
        echo "Cannot find the executable $serverws"
	showuse
	ciao
fi
\end{chunk}
The user just wanted to see what would happen so we output the
command line and exit.
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
if [ $go = no ] ; then
	echo "Would now start the processes."
	echo exec $SPAD/bin/sman $otheropts -ws $serverws
	exit 0
fi
\end{chunk}
All of the options have been processed so we start {\tt sman}
\begin{chunk}{axiomcmd}
exec $SPAD/bin/sman $otheropts -ws $serverws

\end{chunk}

of a child process, what to do when it dies, and the shell command
line necessary to restart the process. There is a linked list of

\chapter{Research Topics}
These are included here as ideas that may get expanded in more detail later.
\section{Proofs}
The goal would be to prove that Axiom's algorithms are correct.

For instance, show that the GCD algorithm is correct. This involves several
levels of proof. At one level we need to prove that the GCD algorithm is
mathematically correct and that it terminates. This can be picked up from
the literature.

A second level of correctness involves proving that the implementation of
the algorithm is correct. This involves using something like ACL2 [KMJ00]
and proof of the common lisp implementation. 

A third level is to show that the binary implementation conforms to the
semantics of the common lisp implementation. This involves using something
like Function Extraction (FX) [LMW79] to extract the machine-level behavior of
the program and comparing it to the specification.

\section{Indefinites}
There are times when it would be convenient to write algorithms in terms
of indefinite values. For instance, we would like to be able to declare
that X and Y are matrices and compute X*Y symbolically. We would like to
be able to do the same with arbitrary integers, I and J. In general, for
a given domain we would like to create domain elements that are not fully
specified but have the computation proceed with these ``indefinite'' values.
\section{Provisos}
We would like to create ``provisos'' on statements such as:
\[\frac{1}{x} {\rm\ provided\ } x \ne 0\]

We would then like to rewrite this in terms of intervals to create three
``continuations'' where each continuation is a separate domain of computation
(and could thus be computed in parallel). So for the above example we would
generate:
\[\frac{1}{x} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in [-\infty,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{x} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{x} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,\infty]\]

When a new proviso is added, for instance, when we divide by y then there
would be further subdivision of the computation, forming a tree:
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in [-\infty,0)
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in  [-\infty,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,0)
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in  [-\infty,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,\infty]
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in  [-\infty,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in [-\infty,0)
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in  (0,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,0)
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in  (0,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,\infty]
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in  (0,0)\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in [-\infty,0)
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in (0,\infty]\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,0)
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in (0,\infty]\]
\[\frac{1}{xy} {\rm\ such\ that\ } x \in (0,\infty]
 {\rm\ and\ } y \in (0,\infty]\]

Interesting questions arise, such has how to recover the function over
the real line. Of course, the domain and range are not restricted to the
real line in general but could, for instance, range over the complex plane.

Note that the provisos need not be an interval. They could be anything
such as a polynomial or a property like ``$f(x)$ is entire''.
