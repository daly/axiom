%% We have to be careful with font-changing in the presence of

%% Scheme something like \it\tt will attempt to use an italic
%% typewriter font.  Thus we define new commands like \Tt which will
%% work with both the Plain and old and new LaTeX schemes.  (Note that
%% NFSS will be standard in the next version of LaTeX.)  A problem with
%% these definitions arises with NFSS: in math mode the won't work
%% unless the {\tt oldlfont} backwards-compatibility option is in effect.
%% For the moment, you can get round this by using \mbox.

%% If you wanted code set in a different font, you could re-define

%% Page-breaking strategy
%% 
%% We want to insert penalties aiming for:
%% 
%% No page breaks in the middle of a code chunk unless necessary to avoid
%% an overfull vbox;
%% 
%% Documentation immediately preceding a code chunk should appear on
%% the same page as that code chunk unless doing so would violate rule 1.
%% 
%% \filbreak is useful for this sort of thing (see The TeX book) and is 
%% used to encourage breaks at the right places between chunks.  Appropriate 
%% penalties are inserted elsewhere, between code lines in particular.
%% 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Environments for setting code
%% 
%% \nwbegincode and \nwendcode are used by noweave to bracket code chunks.
%% The webcode environment is intended for users who want to paste
%% noweave output into papers.
%% 
%% The definition of \nwbegincode is based on the verbatim implementation
%% in verbatim.sty, which will, presumably be in the next version of
%% LaTeX.  One thing it does differently, apart from the catcode changes
%% is setting \linewidth; this will avoid some overfull hboxen when the
%% code lines are too long, but the lines won't be broken anyhow (even
%% within chunk names because of the \maybehbox definition).

%% Maybe the penalties ought to be parameters

\def\nwbegincode#1{%
  \begingroup
    \topsep \nwcodetopsep
    \@beginparpenalty \@highpenalty
    \@endparpenalty -\@highpenalty
  \@begincode }
\def\nwendcode{\endtrivlist \endgroup \filbreak} % keeps code on 1 page

\newenvironment{webcode}{%
  \@begincode
}{%
  \endtrivlist}

%% This is just common code between \nwbegincode and webcode.

%% The \trivlist cliche isn't quite a cliche because we adjust \leftskip
%% for indentation by \codemargin and adjust \rightskip to allow lines up
%% to \codehsize long without overfull boxen
%% ($\mbox{\codehsize}=\mbox{\hsize}+\mbox{\rightskip}$).
%% Note that \hsize isn't altered.

%% The penalty inserted between verbatim lines would normally be
%% \interlinepenalty, but we want to prohibit breaks there.

%% Note the bug lurking somewhere in this code, as reported by Steven Ooms:
%% I have some lay-out problems in the documentation chunks.  When using
%% the (La)TeX commands \hline or \vtop the right margin is always
%% extended far beyond the page margin after the first code chunk has
%% been typeset.  I'm still looking for the exact cause of it, but to me
%% it seems that LaTeX supposes for those commands that the line width
%% for the documentation chunk is as large as that for code chunks, which
%% isn't true in reality.

%% \nwcodepenalty is the penalty for breaking between lines in a
%% code chunk.  If you set it to 10000, code will never be broken across
%% pages.  I guess this should be settable in \noweboptions.

%% The cursing chunk accounts for the addition of a mess of characters
%% to those reset by \noligs in LaTeX2e.

%% We can't make ` other, because then we'll get ligatures.
%% (Why Don put these ligatures in the \tt font I wish I knew.)
%% But we'll step on all the others.

%% Sub-page references

%% This is the wonderful code that Dave Love provided to make page
%% references like 7a, 7b, and so on.

%% This code provides a mechanism for defining `page sub-references'
%% using \sublabel{foo} referenced with \subpageref{foo}.  Sub-references
%% will be numbered like these real examples: 
%% \subpageref{ref:foo},
%% \subpageref{ref:bar},
%% \subpageref{ref:baz}\sublabel{ref:foo}\sublabel{ref:bar}\sublabel{ref:baz}
%% etc.\ unless there is only one on the page, in which case the letter
%% will be dropped like this: \subpageref{ref:fred}.
%% 
%% To be able to use \subpageref we must define the label with \sublabel,
%% used like label.  (Using \ref with a label defined by \sublabel will
%% produce the sub-reference number, by the way, and \pageref works as
%% expected.)  Note that \subpageref is robust and \ref and \pageref are
%% redefined to be robust also, as they will be in future LaTeX releases.
%% Incidentally, these expand to the relevant text plus \null---you might
%% want to strip this off, e.g. for sorting lists.

%% There are various ways we could attack this task (which is made
%% non-trivial by the well-known asynchrony of (La)TeX's output routine),
%% but they all must depend on hacks in the .aux file or a similar one.
%% Joachim Schrod's fnpag.sty does the same sort of thing differently to
%% this LaTeX-specific approach.  See latex.tex for enlightenment on the
%% cross-referencing mechanism and the LaTeX internals used below.  [DL:
%% The internals change in LaTeX2e compared with LaTeX 2.09.  The code
%% here still works, though.]

%% The new-style LaTeX page-reference macros all work the same way: 
%% if the thing is undefined, barf.  Otherwise, do the specified thing.
%% We need to handle the fact that the expansion of the label may be two
%% items or five items, depending on whether hypertext is used.
%% Since we're only ever interested in the first two items, we use a
%% hack---the ``do the specified thing'' must be defined as
%% \mbox{[[\def\dome#1#2#3\\{...}]]} where ... 
%% uses only the first two parameters.

%% \newsublabel is the macro that does the important work.  It is called

%% If we've had at least two on the page, we define the

%% It is either

%% In rare cases, there may be more than 26 chunks on a page.  In such a
%% case, we need a sub-page numbering scheme that can go beyond ``a toz.''  
%% The scheme I have chosen is ``a to z, then aa to zz, then aaa to zzz, etc.''
%% The conversion requires a bit of thought because it is
%% not an ordinary conversion of integer to string as we usually
%% think of such things.  The problem is that the meaning of the letters
%% depends on the position; the letter a acts like a zero in some
%% positions or a one in others.

%% The solution I have implemented uses a variable bound which is always
%% equal to 26^k for some k.  If we write the recurrence B_k = B_{k-1} +
%% 26^k, with B_0 = 0, we then use a string of k letters to represent
%% numbers between B_{k-1}$ and $B_k.  Within that string, a's are 0's,
%% and so on up to z's which are 25's, and we use standard
%% integer-conversion methods to encode n-B_{k-1}.

%% The following Icon implementation may be more perspicuous than the TeX
%% code actually used.  Here the variable bound is 26^k, with k=1
%% initially, and n is n-B_{k-1}.  The first loop finds the right k, and
%% the second does the usual string conversion.

%% The Icon code for subpage numbering is 
%% 
%% procedure alphastring(n)
%%   bound := 26
%% 
%%   while n >= bound do {
%%     # invariant: bound = 26^(k+1) & n is initial n - B_k
%%     n -:= bound
%%     bound *:= 26
%%   }
%%   
%%   while bound > 1 do {
%%     bound /:= 26
%%     d := integer(n / bound)
%%     n -:= d * bound
%%     writes(&lcase[d+1])
%%   }
%% end
