{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.

\chapter{Integration}
An {\sl elementary function}
\index{elementary function}
of a variable $x$ is a function that can
be obtained from the rational functions in $x$ by repeatedly adjoining
a finite number of nested logarithms, exponentials, and algebraic
numbers or functions. Since $\sqrt{-1}$ is elementary, the
trigonometric functions and their inverses are also elementary (when
they are rewritten using complex exponentials and logarithms) as well
as all the ``usual'' functions of calculus. For example,
\begin{equation}
\sin(x+\tan(x^3-\sqrt{x^3-x+1}))
\end{equation}
is elementary when rewritten as
\[
\frac{\sqrt{-1}}{2}(e^{t-x\sqrt{-1}}-e^{x\sqrt{-1}-t})
{\rm\ where\ }
t=\frac{1-e^{2\sqrt{-1}(x^3-\sqrt{x^3-x+1})}}
{1+e^{2\sqrt{-1}(x^3-\sqrt{x^3-x+1})}}
\]
This tutorial describes recent algorithmic solutions to the {\sl
problem of integration in finite terms}: 
\index{integration in finite terms}
to decide in a finite number
of steps whether a given elementary funcction has an elementary
indefinite integral, and to compute it explicitly if it exists. While
this problem was studied extensively by Abel and Liouville during the
last century, the difficulties posed by algebraic functions caused
Hardy (1916) to state that ``there is reason to suppose that no such
method can be given''. This conjecture was eventually disproved by
Risch (1970), who described an algorithm for this problem in a series
of reports \cite{12,13,14,15}. In the past 30 years, this procedure
has been repeatedly improved, extended and refined, yielding practical
algorithms that are now becoming standard and are implemented in most
of the major computer algebra systems. In this tutorial, we outline
the above algorithms for various classes of elementary functions,
starting with rational functions and progressively increasing the
class of functions up to general elementary functions. Proofs of
correctness of the algorithms presented here can be found in several
of the references, and are generally too long and too detailed to be
described in this tutorial.

{\bf Notations}: we write $x$ for the variable of integration, and '
for the derivation $d/dx$. $\mathbb{Z}$,$\mathbb{Q}$,$\mathbb{R}$,and
$\mathbb{C}$ denote respectively the integers, rational, real and
complex numbers. All fields are commutative and, except when mentioned
explicitly otherwise, have characteristic 0. If $K$ is a field, then
$\overline{K}$ denotes its algebraic closure. For a polynomial $p$, 
pp($p$) denotes the primitive
part of $p$, {\sl i. e.} $p$ divided by the gcd of its coefficients.
\section{Rational Functions}
By a {\sl rational function}, we mean a quotient of polynomials in the
integration variable $x$. This means that other functions can appear
in the integrand, provided they do not involve $x$, hence that the
coefficients of our polynomials in $x$ lie in an arbitrary field $K$
satisfying: $\forall{a} \in K,\ a^{'}=0$.

\subsection{The full partial-fraction algorithm}
This method, which dates back to Newton, Leibniz, and Bernoulli,
should not be used in practice, yet it remains the method found in
most calculus tests and is often taught. Its major drawback is the
factorization of the denominator of the integrand over the real or
complex numbers. We outline it because it provides the theoretical
foundations for all the subsequent algorithms. Let 
$f \in \mathbb{R}(x)$ be our integrand, and write 
$f=P+A/D$ where $P, A, D \in \mathbb{R}[x]$, $gcd(A,D)=1$, and
$deg(A) < deg(D)$. Let
\[
D=c\prod_{i=1}^n(x-a_i)^{e_i}\prod_{j=1}^m(x^2+b_jx+c_j)^{f_j}
\]
be the irreducible factorization of $D$ over $\mathbb{R}$, where $c$,
the $a_i$'s, $b_j$'s and $c_j$'s are in $\mathbb{R}$ and the $e_i$'s
and $f_j$'s are positive integers. Computing the partial fraction
decomposition of $f$, we get
\[
f=P+\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^{e_i}\frac{A_{ik}}{(x-a_i)^k}
+\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{k=1}^{f_i}\frac{B_{jk}x+C_{jk}}{(x^2+b_jx+c_j)^k}
\]
where the $A_{ik}$'s, $B_{jk}$'s, and $C_{jk}$'s are in
$\mathbb{R}$. Hence,
\[
\int{f}=\int{P}+\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^{e_i}\int{\frac{A_{ik}}{(x-a_i)^k}}
+\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{k=1}^{f_i}\int{\frac{B_{jk}x+C_{jk}}{(x^2+b_jx+c_j)^k}}
\]
Computing $\int{P}$ poses no problem (it will for any other class of
functions), and for the other terms we have
\begin{equation}
\int{\frac{A_{ik}}{(x-a_i)^k}}=\left\{
\begin{array}{lc}
A_{ik}(x-a_i)^{1-k}/(1-k)&{\rm if\ } k > 1\\
A_{i1}\log(x-a_i)&{\rm if\ } k = 1\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
and, noting that $b_j^2-4c_j < 0$ since $x^2+b_jx+c_j$ is irreducible
in $\mathbb{R}$[x].
\[
\int\frac{B_{j1}x+C_{j1}}{(x^2+b_jx+c_j)}=
\frac{B_{j1}}{2}\log(x^2+b_jx+c_j)
+\frac{2C_{j1}-b_jB_{j1}}{\sqrt{4c_j-b_j^2}}
arctan\left(\frac{2x+b_j}{\sqrt{4c_j-b_j^2}}\right)
\]
and for $k > 1$,
\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
\displaystyle
\int{\frac{B_{jk}x+C_{jk}}{(x^2+b_jx+c_j)^k}}&=&
\displaystyle\frac{(2C_{jk}-b_jB_{jk})x+b_jC_{jk}-2c_jB_{jk}}
{(k-1)(4c_j-b_j^2)(x^2+b_jx+c_j)^{k-1}}\\
&&\displaystyle+\int{\frac{(2k-3)(2C_{jk}-b_jB_{jk})}
{(k-1)(4c_j-b_j^2)(x^2+b_jx+c_j)^{k-1}}}\\
\end{array}
\]
This last formula is then used recursively until $k=1$.

An alternative is to factor $D$ linearly over $\mathbb{C}$:
$D=\prod_{i=1}^q(x-\alpha_i)^{e_i}$, and then use (2) on each term of
\begin{equation}
f=P+\sum_{i=1}^q\sum_{j=1}^{e_i}\frac{A_{ij}}{(x-\alpha_i)^j}
\end{equation}
Note that this alternative is applicable to coefficients in any field
$K$, if we factor $D$ linearly over its algebraic closure
$\overline{K}$, and is equivalent to expanding $f$ into its Laurent
series at all its finite poles, since that series at 
$x=\alpha_i \in \overline{K}$ is
\[
f=\frac{A_{ie_i}}{(x-\alpha_i)^{e_i}}
+\cdots
+\frac{A_{i2}}{(x-\alpha_i)^2}
+\frac{A_{i1}}{(x-\alpha_i)}
+\cdots
\]
where the $A_{ij}$'s are the same as those in (3). Thus, this approach
can be seen as expanding the integrand into series around all the
poles (including $\infty$), then integrating the series termwise, and
then interpolating for the answer, by summing all the polar terms,
obtaining the integral of (3). In addition, this alternative shows
that any rational function $f \in K(x)$ has an elementary integral of
the form
\begin{equation}
\int{f}=v+c_1\log(u_1)+\cdots+c_m\log(u_m)
\end{equation}
where $v,u_1,\ldots,u_m \in \overline{K}(x)$ are the rational
functions, and $c_1,\ldots,c_m \in \overline{K}$ are constants. The
original Risch algorithm is essentially a generalization of this
approach that searches for integrals of arbitrary elementary functions
in a form similar to (4).

\subsection{The Hermite reduction}
The major computational inconvenience of the full partial fraction
approach is the need to factor polynomials over $\mathbb{R}$,
$\mathbb{C}$, or $\overline{K}$, thereby introducing algebraic numbers
even if the integrand and its integral are both in $\mathbb{Q}(x)$. On
the other hand, introducing algebraic numbers may be necessary, for
example it is proven in \cite{14} that any field containing an
integral of $1/(x^2+2)$ must also contain $\sqrt{2}$. Modern research
has yielded so-called ``rational'' algorithms that
\begin{itemize}
\item compute as much of the integral as possible with all
calculations being done in $K(x)$, and
\item compute the minimal algebraic extension of $K$ necessary to
express the integral
\end{itemize}
The first rational algorithms for integration date back to the
$19^{{\rm th}}$ century, when both Hermite\cite{6} and
Ostrogradsky\cite{11} invented methods for computing the $v$ of (4)
entirely within $K(x)$. We describe here only Hermite's method, since
it is the one that has been generalized to arbitrary elementary
functions. The basic idea is that if an irreducible $p \in K[x]$
appears with multiplicity $k > 1$ in the factorization of the
denominator of the integrand, then (2) implies that it appears with
multiplicity $k-1$ in the denominator of the integral. Furthermore, it
is possible to compute the product of all such irreducibles for each
$k$ without factoring the denominator into irreducibles by computing
its {\sl squarefree factorization}, {\sl i.e} a factorization
$D=D_1D_2^2\cdots D_m^m$, where each $D_i$ is squarefree and 
$gcd(D_i,D_j)=1$ for $i \ne j$. A straightforward way to compute it is
as follows: let $R=gcd(D,D^{'})$, then $R=D_2D_2^3\cdots D_m^{m-1}$, so 
$D/R=D_1D_2\cdots D_m$ and $gcd(R,D/R)=D_2\cdots D_m$, which implies
finally that
\[
D_1=\frac{D/R}{gcd(R,D/R)}
\]
Computing recursively a squarefree factorization of $R$ completes the
one for $D$. Note that \cite{23} presents a more efficient method for
this decomposition. Let now $f \in K(x)$ be our integrand, and write
$f=P+A/D$ where $P,A,D \in K[x]$, $gcd(A,D)=1$, and $deg(A)<deg(D)$. 
Let $D=D_1D_2^2\cdots D_m^m$ be a squarefree factorization of $D$ and
suppose that $m \ge 2$ (otherwise $D$ is already squarefree). Let then
$V=D_m$ and $U=D/V^m$. Since $gcd(UV^{'},V)=1$, we can use the
extended Euclidean algorithm to find $B,C \in K[x]$ such that
\[
\frac{A}{1-m}=BUV^{'}+CV
\]
and $deg(B) < deg(V)$. Multiplying both sides by $(1-m)/(UV^m)$ gives
\[
\frac{A}{UV^m}=\frac{(1-m)BV^{'}}{V^m}+\frac{(1-m)C}{UV^{m-1}}
\]
so, adding and subtracting $B^{'}/V^{m-1}$ to the right hand side, we
get
\[
\frac{A}{UV^m}=\left(\frac{B^{'}}{V^{m-1}}-\frac{(m-1)BV^{'}}{V^m}\right)
+\frac{(1-m)C-UB^{'}}{UV^{m-1}}
\]
and integrating both sides yields
\[
\int\frac{A}{UV^m}=\frac{B}{V^{m-1}}+\int\frac{(1-m)C-UB^{'}}{UV^{m-1}}
\]
so the integrand is reduced to one with a smaller power of $V$ in the
denominator. This process is repeated until the denominator is
squarefree, yielding $g,h \in K(x)$ such that $f=g^{'}+h$ and $h$ has
a squarefree denominator.

\subsection{The Rothstein-Trager and Lazard-Rioboo-Trager algorithms}
Following the Hermite reduction, we only have to integrate fractions
of the form $f=A/D$ with $deg(A)<deg(D)$ and $D$ squarefree. It
follows from (2) that
\[
\int{f}=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\log(x-\alpha_i)
\]
where the $\alpha_i$'s are the zeros of $D$ in $\overline{K}$, and the
$a_i$'s are the residues of $f$ at the $\alpha_i$'s. The problem
is then to compute those residues without splitting $D$. Rothstein
\cite{18} and Trager \cite{19} independently proved that the
$\alpha_i$'s are exactly the zeros of
\begin{equation}
R=resultant_x(D,A-tD^{'}) \in K[t]
\end{equation}
and that the splitting field of $R$ over $K$ is indeed the minimal
algebraic extension of $K$ necessary to express the integral in the
form (4). The integral is then given by
\begin{equation}
\int\frac{A}{D}=\sum_{i=1}^m\sum_{a|R_i(a)=0}a\log(\gcd(D,A-aD^{'}))
\end{equation}
where $R=\prod_{i=1}^m R_i^{e_i}$ is the irreducible factorization of
$R$ over $K$. Note that this algorithm requires factoring $R$ into
irreducibles over $K$, and computing greatest common divisors in
$(K[t]/(R_i))[x]$, hence computing with algebraic numbers. Trager and
Lazard \& Rioboo \cite{7} independently discovered that those
computations can be avoided, if one uses the subresultant PRS
algorithm to compute the resultant of (5): let 
$(R_0,R_1,\ldots R_k\ne 0,0,\ldots)$ be the subresultant PRS with
respect to $x$ of $D$ and $A-tD^{'}$ and $R=Q_1Q_2^2\ldots Q_m^m$ be a 
{\sl squarefree} factorization of their resultant. Then,
\[
\sum_{a|Q_i(a)=0} a\log(\gcd(D,A-aD^{'}))=\hbox{\hskip 5.0cm}
\]
\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\sum_{a|Q_i(a)=0} a \log(D) & {\rm if\ }i = deg(D)\\
\sum_{a|Q_i(a)=0} a \log({\rm pp}_x(R_{k_i})(a,x))&
{\rm where\ }deg(R_{k_i})=i,1 \le k_i \le n\\
&{\rm if\ }i < deg(D)
\end{array}
\right.
\]
Evaluating ${\rm pp}_x(R_{k_i})$ at $t=a$ where $a$ is a root of $Q_i$
is equivalent to reducing each coefficient with respect to $x$ of
${\rm pp}_x(R_{k_i})$ module $Q_i$, hence computing in the algebraic
extension $K[t]/(Q_i)$. Even this step can be avoided: it is in fact
sufficient to ensure that $Q_i$ and the leading coefficient with
respect to $x$ of $R_{k_i}$ do not have a nontrivial common factor,
which implies then that the remainder by $Q_i$ is nonzero, see
\cite{10} for details and other alternatives for computing
${\rm pp}_x(R_{k_i})(a,x)$

\section{Algebraic Functions}
By an {\sl algebraic function}, we mean an element of a finitely
generated algebraic extension $E$ of the rational function field
$K(x)$. This includes nested radicals and implicit algebraic
functions, not all of which can be expressed by radicals. It turns out
that the algorithms we used for rational functions can be extended to
algebraic functions, but with several difficulties, the first one
being to define the proper analogues of polynomials, numerators and
denominators. Since $E$ is algebraic over $K(x)$, for any
$\alpha \in E$, there exists a polynomial $p \in K[x][y]$ such that 
$p(x,\alpha)=0$. We say that $\alpha \in E$ is {\sl integral over}
$K[x]$ if there is a polynomial $p \in K[x][y]$, {\sl monic in y},
such that $p(x,\alpha)=0$. Integral elements are analogous to
polynomials in that their value is defined for any 
$x \in \overline{K}$ (unlike non-integral elements, which must have at
least one pole in $\overline{K}$). The set
\[
{\bf O}_{K[x]} = \{\alpha \in E {\rm\ such\ that\ }\alpha
{\rm\ is\ integral\ over\ }K[x]\}
\]
is called the {\sl integral closure of} $K[x]$ {\sl in E}. It is a
ring and a finitely generated $K[x]$-module. Let $\alpha \in E^{*}$ be
any element and $p=\sum_{i=0}^m a_iy^i \in K[x][y]$ be such that
$p(x,\alpha)=0$ and $a_m \ne 0$. Then, $q(x,a_my)=0$ where
$q=y^m+\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_ia_m^{m-i-1}y^i$ is monic in $y$, 
so $a_my \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$. We need a canonical representation
for algebraic functions similar to quotients of polynomials for
rational functions. Expressions as quotients of integral functions are
not unique, for example, $\sqrt{x}/x=x/\sqrt{x}$. Hoever, $E$ is a
finite-dimensional vector space over $K(x)$, so let $n=[E:K(x)]$ and
$w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ be any basis for $E$ over $K(x)$. By the above
remark, there are $a_1,\ldots,a_n \in K(x)^{*}$ such that
$a_iw_i \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$ for each $i$. Since
$(a_1w_1,\ldots,a_nw_n)$ is also a basis for $E$ over $K(x)$, we can
assume without loss of generality that the basis $w$ is composed of
integral elements. Any $\alpha \in E$ can be written uniquely as
$\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n f_iw_i$ for $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in K(x)$, and
putting the $f_i$'s over a monic common denominator $D \in K[x]$, we
get an expression
\[
\alpha = \frac{A_1w_1+\ldots+A_nw_n}{D}
\]
where $A_1,\ldots,A_n \in K[x]$ and $\gcd(D,A_1,\ldots,A_n)=1$. We
call $\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$ and
$D \in K[x]$ respectively the {\sl numerator} and {\sl denominator} of
$\alpha$ with respect to $w$. They are defined uniquely once the basis
$w$ is fixed.
\subsection{The Hermite reduction}
Now that we have numerators and denominators for algebraic functions,
we can attempt to generalize the Hermite reduction of the previous
section, so let $f \in E$ be our integrand, 
$w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n) \in {{\bf O}_{K[n]}}^{n}$ be a basis for $E$
over $K(x)$ and let $\sum_{i=1}^m A_iw_i \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$
and $D \in K[x]$ be the numerator and denominator of $f$ with respect
to $w$, Let $D=D_1D_2^2\ldots D_m^m$ be a squarefree factorization of
$D$ and suppose that $m \ge 2$. Let then $V=D_m$ and $U=D/V^m$, and we
ask whether we can compute 
$B=\sum_{i=1}^n B_iw_i \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$ and $h \in E$ such
that $deg(B_i) < deg(V)$ for each $i$,
\begin{equation}
\int\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i}{UV^m}=\frac{B}{V^{m-1}}+\int{h}
\end{equation}
and the denominator of $h$ with respect to $w$ has no factor of order
$m$ or higher. This turns out to reduce to solving the following
linear system
\begin{equation}
f_1S_1+\ldots+f_nS_n=A_1w_1+\ldots+A_nw_n
\end{equation}
for $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in K(x)$, where
\begin{equation}
S_i=UV^m\left(\frac{w_i}{V^{m-1}}\right)^{'}\quad{\rm for\ }1\le i\le n
\end{equation}
Indeed, suppose that (8) has a solution $f_1,\ldots,f_n \in K(x)$, and
write $f_i=T_i/Q$, where $Q,T_1,\ldots,T_n \in K[x]$ and
$\gcd(Q,T_1,\ldots,T_n)=1$. Suppose further that $\gcd(Q,V)=1$. Then,
we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find $A,R \in K[x]$
such that $AV+RQ=1$, and Euclidean division to find $Q_i,B_i \in K[x]$
such that $deg(B_i)<deg(V)$ when $B_i \ne 0$ and $RT_i=VQ_i+B_i$ for
each $i$. We then have
\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
h&=&\displaystyle
f-\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n B_iw_i}{V^{m-1}}\right)^{'}\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nA_iw_i}{UV^m}
-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nB_i^{'}w_i}{V^{m-1}}
-\sum_{i=1}^n(RT_i-VQ_i)\left(\frac{w_i}{V^{m-1}}\right)^{'}\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nA_iw_i}{UV^m}
-\frac{R\sum_{i=1}^nT_iS_i}{UV^m}
+V\sum_{i=1}^nQ_i\left(\frac{w_i}{V^{m-1}}\right)^{'}
-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nB_i^{'}w_i}{V^{m-1}}\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle
\frac{(1-RQ)\sum_{i=1}^nA_iw_i}{UV^m}
+\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nQ_iw_i^{'}}{V^{m-2}}
-(m-1)V^{'}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nQ_iw_i}{V^{m-1}}
-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nB_i^{'}w_i}{V^{m-1}}\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nAA_iw_i}{UV^{m-1}}
-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n((m-1)V^{'}Q_i+B_i^{'})w_i}{V^{m-1}}
+\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nQ_iw_i^{'}}{V^{m-2}}
\end{array}
\]
Hence, if in addition the denominator of $h$ has no factor of order
$m$ or higher, then $B=\sum_{i=1}^nB_iw_i \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$
and $h$ solve (7) and we have reduced the integrand. Unfortunately, it
can happen that the denominator of $h$ has a factor of order $m$ or
higher, or that (8) has no solution in $K(x)$ whose denominator is
coprime with $V$, as the following example shows.

\noindent
{\bf Example 1} Let $E=K(x)[y]/(y^4+(x^2+x)y-x^2)$ {\sl with basis}
$w=(1,y,y^2,y^3)$ {\sl over} $K(x)$ {\sl and consider the integrand}
\[
f=\frac{y^3}{x^2}=\frac{w_4}{x^2}\in E
\]
We have $D=x^2$, so $U=1,V=x$ and $m=2$.
Then, $S_1=x^2(1/x)^{'}=-1$,
\[
\begin{array}{lcl}
\displaystyle S_2&=&x^2\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^{'}\\
&&\\
\displaystyle &=&\frac{24(1-x^2)y^3+32x(1-x)y^2-(9x^4+45x^3+209x^2+63x+18)y
-18x(x^3+x^2-x-1)}{27x^4+108x^3+418x^2+108x+27}\\
&&\\
\displaystyle S_3&=&x^2\left(\frac{y^2}{x}\right)^{'}\\
&&\\
\displaystyle &=&
\frac{64x(1-x)y^3+9(x^4+2x^3-2x-1)y^2+12x(x^3+x^2-x-1)y+48x^2(1-x^2)}
{27x^4+108x^3+418x^2+108x+27}\\
&&\\
and&&\\
&&\\
\displaystyle S_4&=&x^2\left(\frac{y^3}{x}\right)^{'}\\
&&\\
\displaystyle &=&\frac{(27x^4+81x^3+209x^2+27x)y^3+18x(x^3+x^2-x-1)y^2
+24x^2(x^2-1)y+96x^3(1-x)}
{27x^4+108x^3+418x^2+108x+27}
\end{array}
\]
{\sl so (8) becomes}
\begin{equation}
M
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
f_1\\
f_2\\
f_3\\
f_4
\end{array}
\right)=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
0\\
1
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
{\sl where}
\[
M=\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
\displaystyle -1&\frac{-18x(x^3+x^2-x-1)}{F}&\frac{48x^2(1-x^2)}{F}
&\frac{96x^3(1-x)}{F}\\
\displaystyle 0&\frac{-(9x^4+45x^3+209x^2+63x+18)}{F}
&\frac{12x(x^3+x^2-x-1)}{F}&\frac{24x^2(x^2-1)}{F}\\
\displaystyle 0&\frac{32x(1-x)}{F}&\frac{9(x^4+2x^3-2x-1)}{F}
&\frac{18x(x^3+x^2-x-1)}{F}\\
\displaystyle 0&\frac{24(1-x^2)}{F}&\frac{64x(1-x)}{F}
&\frac{(27x^4+81x^3+209x^2+27x)}{F}
\end{array}
\right)
\]
and $F=27x^4+108x^3+418x^2+108x+27$. The system (10) admits a unique
solution $f_1=f_2=0, f_3=-2$ and $f_4=(x+1)/x$, whose denominator is
not coprime with $V$, so the Hermite reduction is not applicable.

The above problem was first solved by Trager \cite{20}, who proved 
that if $w$ is an {\sl integral basis, i.e.} its elements generate 
${\bf O}_{K[x]}$ over $K[x]$, then the system (8) always has a
unique solution in $K(x)$ when $m > 1$, and that solution always has a
denominator coprime with V. Furthermore, the denominator of each
$w_i^{'}$ must be squarefree, implying that the denominator of $h$ is
a factor of $FUV^{m-1}$ where $F \in K[x]$ is squarefree and coprime
with $UV$. He also described an algorithm for computing an integral
basis, a necessary preprocessing for his Hermite reduction. The main
problem with that approach is that computing the integral basis,
whether by the method of \cite{20} or the local alternative \cite{21},
can be in general more expansive than the rest of the reduction
process. We describe here the lazy Hermite reduction \cite{5}, which
avoids the precomputation of an integral basis. It is based on the
observation that if $m > 1$ and (8) does not have a solution allowing
us to perform the reduction, then either
\begin{itemize}
\item the $S_i$'s are linearly dependent over $K(x)$, or
\item (8) has a unique solution in $K(x)$ whose denominator has a
nontrivial common factor with $V$, or
\item the denominator of some $w_i$ is not squarefree
\end{itemize}
In all of the above cases, we can replace our basis $w$ by a new one,
also made up of integral elements, so that that $K[x]$-module
generated by the new basis strictly contains the one generated by $w$:

\noindent
{\bf Theorem 1 (\cite{5})} {\sl Suppose that $m \ge 2$ and that 
$\{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}$ as given by (9) are linearly dependent over $K(x)$,
and let $T_1,\ldots,T_n \in K[x]$ be not all 0 and such that
$\sum_{i=1}^n T_iS_i=0$. Then,
\[
w_0=\frac{U}{V}\sum_{i=1}^n T_iw_i \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}
\]
Furthermore, if $\gcd(T_1,\ldots,T_n)=1$ then
$w_0 \notin K[x]w_1+\cdots+K[x]w_n$.}

\noindent
{\bf Theorem 2 (\cite{5})} {\sl Suppose that $m \ge 2$ and that
$\{S_1,\ldots,S_n\}$ as given by (9) are linearly independent over
$K(x)$, and let $Q,T_1,\ldots,T_n \in K[x]$ be such that
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i = \frac{1}{Q}\sum_{i=1}^n T_iS_i
\]
Then,
\[
w_0=\frac{U(V/\gcd(V,Q))}{\gcd(V,Q)}\sum_{i=1}^n T_iw_i \in 
{\bf O}_{K[x]}
\]
Furthermore, 
if $\gcd(Q,T_1,\ldots,T_n)=1$ and $\deg(\gcd(V,Q)) \ge 1$, then
$w_0 \notin K[x]w_1+\cdots+K[x]w_n$.}

{\bf Theorem 3 (\cite{5})} {\sl Suppose that the denominator $F$ of
some $w_i$ is not squarefree, and let $F=F_1F_2^2\cdots F_k^k$ be its
squarefree factorization. Then,}
\[
w_0=F_1\cdots F_kw_i^{'} \in {\bf O}_{K[x]} \backslash
(K[x]w_1+\cdots+K[x]w_n).
\]

The lazy Hermite reduction proceeds by solving the system (8) in
$K(x)$. Either the reduction will succeed, or one of the above
theorems produces an element
$w_0 \in {\bf O}_{K[x]} \backslash (K[x]w_1+\cdots+K[x]w_n).$ Let then
$\sum_{i=1}^n C_iw_i$ and $F$ be the numerator and denominator of
$w_0$ with respect to $w$. Using Hermitian row reduction, we can zero
out the last row of
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
F  &   &      &\\
   &F  &      &\\
   &   &\ddots&\\
   &   &      &F\\
C_1&C_2&\cdots&C_n
\end{array}
\right)
\]
obtaining a matrix of the form
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
C_{1,1} & C_{1,2} & \cdots & C_{1,n}\\
C_{2,1} & C_{2,2} & \cdots & C_{2,n}\\
\vdots  & \vdots  &        & \vdots\\
C_{n,1} & C_{n,2} & \cdots & C_{n,n}\\
0       & 0       & \cdots & 0\\
\end{array}
\right)
\]
with $C_{ij} \in K[x]$. Let $\overline{w}_i=(\sum_{j=1}^n
C_{ij}w_j)/F$
for $1 \le i \le n$. Then, 
$\overline{w}=(\overline{w}_1,\ldots,\overline{w}_n)$ is a basis for
$E$ over $K$ and
\[
K[x]\overline{w}_1+\cdots+K[x]\overline{w}_n=K[x]w_1+\cdots+K[x]w_n+K[x]w_0
\]
is a submodule of ${\bf O}_{K[x]}$, which strictly contains
$K[x]w_1+\cdots+K[x]w_n$, since it contains $w_0$. Any strictly
increasing chain of submodules of ${\bf O}_{K[x]}$ must
stabilize after a finite number of steps, which means that this
process produces a basis for which either the Hermite reduction can be
carried out, or for which $f$ has a squarefree denominator.

\noindent
{\bf Example 2} Continuing example 1 for which the Hermite reduction
failed, Theorem 2 implies that
\[
w_0=\frac{1}{x}(-2xw_3+(x+1)w_4)=(-2xy^2+(x+1)y^3)x \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}
\]
Performing a Hermitian row reduction on
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
x& &   & \\
 &x&   & \\
 & &x  & \\
 & &   &x\\
0&0&-2x&x+1\\
\end{array}
\right)
\]
yields
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
x& & & \\
 &x& & \\
 & &x& \\
 & & &1\\
0&0&0&0\\
\end{array}
\right)
\]
so the new basis is $\overline{w}=(1,y,y^2,y^3/x)$, and the
denominator of $f$ with respect to $\overline{w}$ is 1, which is
squarefree. 

\subsection{Simple radical extensions}
The integration algorithm becomes easier when $E$ is a simple radical
extension of $K(x)$, {\sl i.e.} $E=K(x)[y]/(y^n-a)$ for some 
$a \in K(x)$. Write $a=A/D$ where $A,D \in K[x]$, and let
$AD^{n-1}=A_1A_2^2\cdots A_k^k$ be a squarefree factorization of 
$AD^{n-1}$. Writing $i=nq_i+r_i$, for $1 \le i \le k$, where
$0 \le r_i < n$, let $F=A_1^{q_1}\cdots A_k^{q_k}$,
$H=A_1^{r_1}\cdots A_k^{r_k}$ and $z=yD/F$. Then,
\[
z^n=\left(y\frac{D}{F}\right)^n=\frac{y^nD^n}{F^n}=\frac{AD^{n-1}}{F}
=A_1^{r_1}\cdots A_k^{r_k}=H
\]
Since $r_i < n$ for each $i$, the squarefree factorization of $H$ is
of the form $H=H_1H_2^2\cdots H_m^m$ with $m<n$. An integral basis is
then $w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ where
\begin{equation}
w_i=\frac{z^{i-1}}{\prod_{j=1}^m H_j^{\lfloor(i-1)j/n\rfloor}}\quad
1 \le i \le n
\end{equation}
and the Hermite reductions with respect to the above basis is always 
guaranteed to succeed. Furthermore, when using that basis, the system
(8) becomes diagonal and its solution can be written explicitly:
writing $D_i=\prod_{j=1}^m H_j^{\lfloor ij/n\rfloor}$ we have
\[
\begin{array}{ccl}
S_i & = &\displaystyle UV^m\left(\frac{w_i}{V^{m-1}}\right)^{'}
=UV^m\left(\frac{z^{i-1}}{D_{i-1}V^{m-1}}\right)^{'}\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle UV^m\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\frac{H^{'}}{H}-
\frac{{D_{i-1}}^{'}}{D_{i-1}}
-(m-1)\frac{V^{'}}{V}\right)\left(\frac{z^{i-1}}{D_{i-1}V^{m-1}}\right)\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle U\left(V\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\frac{H^{'}}{H}
-\frac{{D_{i-1}}^{'}}{D_{i-1}}\right)-(m-1)V^{'}\right)w_i
\end{array}
\]
so the unique solution of (8) in $K(x)$ is
\begin{equation}
f_i=\frac{A_i}{U\left(V\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\frac{H^{'}}{H}-
\frac{{D_{i-1}}^{'}}{D_{i-1}}\right)-(m-1)V^{'}\right)}
\quad{\rm for\ }1 \le i \le n
\end{equation}
and it can be shown that the denominator of each $f_i$ is coprime with 
$V$ when $m \ge 2$.

\noindent
{\bf Example 3} {\sl Consider
\[
\int\frac{(2x^8+1)\sqrt{(x^8+1)}}{x^{17}+2x^9+x}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{(2x^8+1)y}{x^{17}+2x^9+x} \in E
=\mathbb{Q}(x)[y]/(y^2-x^8-1)
\]
so $H=x^8+1$ which is squarefree, implying that the integral basis
(11) is $(w_1,w_2)=(1,y)$. The squarefree factorization of
$x^{17}+2x^9+x$ is $x(x^8+1)^2$ so $U=x$, $V=x^8+1$, $m=2$, and the
solution (12) of (8) is
\[
f_1=0,\quad
f_2=\frac{2x^8+1}{x\left((x^8+1)\frac{1}{2}\frac{8x^7}{x^8+1}
-8x^7\right)}=-\frac{(2x^8+1)/4}{x^8}
\]
We have $Q=x^8$, so $V-Q=1$, $A=1$, $R=-1$ and $RQf_2=V/2-1/4$,
implying that
\[
B=-\frac{y}{4}\quad {\rm and}\quad h=f-\left(\frac{B}{V}\right)^{'}
=\frac{y}{x(x^8+1)}
\]
solve (7), i.e.
\[
\int\frac{(2x^8+1)\sqrt{(x^8+1)}}{x^{17}+2x^9+x}~dx=
-\frac{\sqrt{x^8+1}}{4(x^8+1)}
+\int\frac{\sqrt{x^8+1}}{x(x^8+1)}~dx
\]
and the remaining integrand has a squarefree denominator.}

\subsection{Liouville's Theorem}
Up to this point, the algorithms we have presented never fail, yet it
can happen that an algebraic function does not have an elementary
integral, for example
\[
\int{\frac{x~dx}{\sqrt{1-x^3}}}
\]
which is not an elementary function of $x$. So we need a way to
recognize such functions before completing the integration
algorithm. Liouville was the first to state and prove a precise
theorem from Laplace's observation that we can restrict the elementary
integration problem by allowing only new logarithms to appear linearly
in the integral, all the other terms appearing in the integral being
already in the integrand.

{\bf Theorem 4 (Liouville \cite{8,9})} {\sl
Let $E$ be an algebraic extension of the rational function field
$K(x)$, and $f \in E$. If $f$ has an elementary integral, then there
exist $v \in E$, constants $c_1,\ldots,c_n \in \overline{K}$ and
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in E(c_1,\ldots,c_k)^{*}$ such that}
\begin{equation}
f=v^{'}+c_1\frac{u_1^{'}}{u_1}+\cdots+c_k\frac{u_k^{'}}{u_k}
\end{equation}
The above is a restriction to algebraic functions of the strong
Liouville Theorem, whose proof can be found in \cite{4,14}. An elegant
and elementary algebraic proof of a slightly weaker version can be
found in \cite{17}. As a consequence, we can look for an integral of
the form (4), Liouville's Theorem guaranteeing that there is no
elementary integral if we cannot find one in that form. Note that the
above theorem does not say that every integral must have the above
form, and in fact that form is not always the most convenient one, for
example, 
\[
\int{\frac{dx}{1+x^2}}=arctan(x)=\frac{\sqrt{-1}}{2}
\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{-1}+x}{\sqrt{-1}-x}\right)
\]

\subsection{The integral part}
Following the Hermite reduction, we can assume that we have a basis 
$w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ of $E$ over $K(x)$ made of integral elements such
that our integrand is of the form $f=\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i/D$ where 
$D \in K[x]$ is squarefree. Given Liouville's Theorem, we now have to
solve equation (13) for $v$, $u_1,\ldots,u_k$ and the constants 
$c_1,\ldots,c_k$. Since $D$ is squarefree, it can be shown that 
$v \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$ for any solution, and in fact $v$
corresponds to the polynomial part of the integral of rational
functions. It is however more difficult to compute than the integral
of polynomials, so Trager \cite{20} gave a change of variable that
guarantees that either $v^{'}=0$ or $f$ has no elementary integral. In
order to describe it, we need to define the analogue for algebraic
functions of having a nontrivial polynomial part: we say that 
$\alpha \in E$ is {\sl integral at infinity} if there is a polynomial
$p=\sum_{i=1}^m a_iy^i \in K[x][y]$ such that $p(x,\alpha)=0$ and
$deg(a_m) \ge deg(a_i)$ for each $i$. Note that a rational function
$A/D \in K(x)$ is integral at infinity if and only if 
$deg(A) \le deg(D)$ since it is a zero of $Dy-A$. When $\alpha-E$ is
not integral at infinity, we say that it has a {\sl pole at
infinity}. Let
\[
{\bf O}_\infty = \{\alpha \in E {\rm\ such\ that\ }\alpha
{\rm\ is\ integral\ at\ infinity}\}
\]
A set $(b_1,\ldots,b_n) \in E^n$ is called {\sl normal at infinity} if
there are $r_1,\ldots,r_n \in K(x)$ such that every 
$\alpha \in {\bf O}_\infty$ can be written as
$\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n B_ir_ib_i/C$ where $C,B_1,\ldots,B_n \in K[x]$
and $deg(C) \ge deg(B_i)$ for each $i$. We say that the differential
$\alpha ~dx$ is integral at infinity if 
$\alpha x^{1+1/r} \in {\bf O}_\infty$ where $r$ is the smallest
ramification index at infinity. Trager \cite{20} described an
algorithm that converts an arbitrary integral basis $w_1,\ldots,w_n$
into one that is also normal at infinity, so the first part of his
integration algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick any basis $b=(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ of $E$ over $K(x)$ that is
composed of integral elements.
\item Pick an integer $N \in \mathbb{Z}$ that is not zero of the
denominator of $f$ with respect to $b$, nor of the discriminant of $E$
over $K(x)$, and perform the change of variable $x=N+1/z$,
$dx=-dz/z^2$ on the integrand.
\item Compute an integral basis $w$ for $E$ over $K(z)$ and make it
normal at infinity
\item Perform the Hermite reduction on $f$ using $w$, this yields 
$g,h \in E$ such that $\int{f~dz}=g+\int{h~dz}$ and $h$ has a
squarefree denominator with respect to $w$.
\item If $hz^2$ has a pole at infinity, then $\int{f~dz}$ and
$\int{h~dz}$ are not elementary functions
\item Otherwise, $\int{h~dz}$ is elementary if and only if there are
constants $c_1,\ldots,c_k \in \overline{K}$ and 
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in E(c_1,\ldots,c_k)^{*}$ such that
\end{enumerate}
\begin{equation}
h=\frac{c_1}{u_1}\frac{du_1}{dz}+\cdots+\frac{c_k}{u_k}\frac{du_k}{dz}
\end{equation}
The condition that $N$ is not a zero of the denominator of $f$ with
respect to $b$ implies that the $f~dz$ is integral at infinity after
the change of variable, and Trager proved that if $h~dz$ is not
integral at infinity after the Hermite reduction, then $\int{h~dz}$
and $\int{f~dz}$ are not elementary functions. The condition that $N$
is not a zero of the discriminant of $E$ over $K(x)$ implies that the
ramification indices at infinity are all equal to 1 after the change
of variable, hence that $h~dz$ is integral at infinity if and only if
$hz^2 \in {\bf O}_\infty$. That second condition on $N$ can be
disregarded, in which case we must replace $hz^2$ in step 5 by 
$hz^{1+1/r}$ where $r$ is the smallest ramification index at
infinity. Note that $hz^2 \in {\bf O}_\infty$ implies that 
$hz^{1+1/r} \in {\bf O}_\infty$, but not conversely. Finally, we
remark that for simple radical extensions, the integral basis (11) is
already normal at infinity.

Alternatively, we can use lazy Hermite reduction in the above
algorithm: in step 3, we pick any basis made of integral elements,
then perform the lazy Hermite reduction in step 4. If $h \in K(z)$
after the Hermite reduction, then we can complete the integral without
computing an integral basis. Otherwise, we compute an integral basis
and make it normal at infinity between steps 4 and 5. This lazy
variant can compute $\int{f~dx}$ whenever it is an element of $E$
without computing an integral basis.

\subsection{The logarithmic part}
Following the previous sections, we are left with solving equation
(14) for the constants $c_1,\ldots,c_k$ and for $u_1,\ldots,u_k$. We
must make at this point the following additional assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item we have an integral primitive element for $E$ over $K(z)$, {\sl
i.e.} $y \in {\bf O}_{K[z]}$ such that $E=K(z)(y)$,
\item $[E : K(z)]=[E : \overline{K}(z)]$, {\sl i.e.} the minimal
polynomial for $y$ over $K[z]$ is absolutely reducible, and
\item we have an integral basis $w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ for $E$ over
$K(z)$, and $w$ is normal at infinity
\end{itemize}
A primitive element can be computed by considering linear combinations
of the generators of $E$ over $K(x)$ with random coefficients in
$K(x)$, and Trager \cite{20} describes an absolute factorization
algorithm, so the above assumptions can be ensured, although those
steps can be computationally very expensive, except in the case of
simple radical extensions. Before describing the second part of
Trager's integration algorithm, we need to define some concepts from
the theory of algebraic curves. Given a finite algebraic extension 
$E=K(z)(y)$ of $K(z)$, a {\sl place} $P$ of $E$ is a proper local
subring of $E$ containing $K$, and a {\sl divisor} is a formal sum
$\sum{n_PP}$ with finite support, where the $n_P$'s are integers and
the $P$'s are places. Let $P$ be a place, then its maximal ideal
$\mu_P$ is principal, so let $p\in E$ be a generator of $\mu_P$. The
{\sl order at} $P$ is the function 
$\nu_P : E^{*} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ which maps $f \in E^{*}$ to the
largest $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f \in p^kP$. Given 
$f \in E^{*}$, the {\sl divisor of} $f$ is $(f) = \sum{\nu_P(f)P}$
where the sum is taken over all the places. It has finite support
since $\nu_P(f) \ne 0$ if and only if $P$ is a pole or zero of
$f$. Finally, we way that a divisor $\delta = \sum{n_PP}$ is
{\sl principal} if $\delta=(f)$ for some $f \in E^{*}$. Note that if 
$\delta$ is principal, the $\sum{n_P}=0$, but the converse is not
generally true, except if $E=K(z)$. Trager's algorithm proceeds
essentially by constructing candidate divisors for the $u_i$'s of
(14): 
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i$ be the numerator of $h$ with respect
to $w$, and $D$ be its (squarefree) denominator
\item Write $\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i=G/H$, where $G \in K[z,y]$ and 
$H \in K[z]$
\item Let $f \in K[z,y]$ be the (monic) minimum polynomial for $y$
over $K(z)$, $t$ be a new indeterminante and compute
\[
R(t)={\rm resultant_z\ }\left({\rm\ pp_t }\left({\rm\ resultant_y\ }\left(
G-tH\frac{dD}{dz},F\right)\right),D\right) \in K[t]
\]
\item Let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_s \in \overline{K}$ be the distinct
nonzero roots of $R$, $(q_1,\ldots,q_k)$ be a basis for the vector
space that they generate over $\mathbb{Q}$, write
$\alpha_i=r_{i1}q_1+\cdots+r_{ik}q_k$ for each $i$, where 
$r_{ij} \in \mathbb{Q}$ and let $m > 0$ be a common denominator for
all the $r_{ij}$'s
\item For $1 \le j \le k$, let 
$\delta_j=\sum_{i=1}^s mr_{ij}\sum_l r_lP_l$ where $r_l$ is the
ramification index of $P_l$ and $P_l$ runs over all the places at
which $h~dz$ has residue $r_i\alpha_i$
\item If there are nonzero integers $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ such that 
$n_j\delta_j$ is principal for each $j$, then let
\[
u=h-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^k\frac{q_j}{n_ju_j}\frac{du_j}{dz}
\]
where $u_j \in E(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_s)^{*}$ is such that 
$n_j\delta_j=(u_j)$. If $u=0$, then 
$\int{h~dz}=\sum_{j=1}^k q_j\log(u_j)/(mn_j)$, otherwise if either 
$u \ne 0$ or there is no such integer $n_j$ for at least one $j$,
then $h~dz$ has no elementary integral.
\end{itemize}
Note that this algorithm expresses the integral, when it is
elementary, with the smallest possible number of logarithms. Steps 3
to 6 requires computing in the splitting field $K_0$ of $R$ over $K$,
but it can be proven that, as in the case of rational functions, $K_0$
is the minimal algebraic extension of $K$ necessary to express the
integral in the form (4). Trager \cite{20} describes a representation
of divisors as fractional ideals and gives algorithms for the
arithmetic of divisors and for testing whether a given divisor is
principal. In order to determine whether there exists an integer $N$
such that $N\delta$ is principal, we need to reduce the algebraic
extension to one over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^q}$ for some
``good'' prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$. Over $\mathbb{F}_{p^q}$, it is
known that for every divisor $\delta=\sum{n_PP}$ such that
$\sum{n_P}=0$, $M\delta$ is principal for some integer
$1 \le M \le (1+\sqrt{p^q})^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the curve
\cite{22}, so we compute such an $M$ by testing $M=1,2,3,\ldots$ until
we find it. It can then be shown that for almost all primes $p$, if
$M\delta$ is not principal in characteristic 0, the $N\delta$ is not
principal for any integer $N \ne 0$. Since we can test whether the
prime $p$ is ``good'' by testing whether the image in
$\mathbb{F}_{p^q}$ of the discriminant of the discriminant of the
minimal polynomial for $y$ over $K[z]$ is 0, this yields a complete
algorithm. In the special case of hyperelliptic extensions, {\sl i.e.}
simple radical extensions of degree 2, Bertrand \cite{1} describes a
simpler representation of divisors for which the arithmetic and
principality tests are more efficient than the general methods.

\noindent
{\bf Example 4} {\sl
Continuing example 3, we were left with the integrand
\[
\frac{\sqrt{x^8+1}}{x(x^8+1)}=\frac{w_2}{x(x^8+1)} \in E
=\mathbb{Q}(x)[y]/(y^2-x^8-1)
\]
where $(w_1,w_2)=(1,y)$ is an integral basis normal at infinity, and
the denominator $D=x(x^8+1)$ of the integrand is squarefree. Its
numerator is $w_2=y$, so the resultant of step 3 is
\[
resultant_x(pp_t(resultant_y(y-t(9x^8+1),y^2-x^8-1)),x(x^8+1))=
ct^{16}(t^2-1)
\]
where $c$ is a large nonzero integer. Its nonzero roots are $\pm 1$,
and the integrand has residue 1 at the place $P$ corresponding to the
point $(x,y)=(0,1)$ and $-1$ at the place $Q$ corresponding to the
point $(x,y)=(0,-1)$, so the divisor $\delta_1$ of step 5 is 
$\delta_1=P-Q$. It turns out that $\delta_1$, $2\delta_1$, and 
$3\delta_1$ are not principal, but that
\[
4\delta_1=\left(\frac{x^4}{1+y}\right)\quad{\rm\ and\ }\quad
\frac{w_2}{x(x^8+1)}
-\frac{1}{4}\frac{(x^4/(1+y))^{'}}{x^4/(1+y)}=0
\]
which implies that
\[
\int{\frac{\sqrt{x^8+1}}{x(x^8+1)}}~dx
=\frac{1}{4}\log\left(\frac{x^4}{1+\sqrt{x^8+1}}\right)
\]}

\noindent
{\bf Example 5} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{x~dx}{\sqrt{1-x^3}}}
\]
The integrand is 
\[
f=\frac{xy}{1-x^3} \in E =

\]
where $(w_1,w_2)=(1,y)$ is an integral basis normal at infinity, and
the denominaotr $D=1-x^3$ of the integrand is squarefree. Its
numerator is $xw_2=xy$, so the resultant of step 3 is
\[
resultant_x(pp_t(resultant_y(xy+3tx^2,y^2+x^3-1)),1-x^3)=729t^6
\]
whose only root is 0. Since $f \ne 0$, we conclude from step 6 that
$\int{f~dx}$ is not an elementary function.}

\noindent
{\bf Example 6} {\sl
\[
\int{\frac{dx}{x\sqrt{1-x^3}}}
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{y}{x-x^4} \in E =
\mathbb{Q}(x)[y]/(y^2+x^3-1)
\]
where $(w_1,w_2)=(1,y)$ is an integral basis normal at infinity, and
the denominator $D=x-x^4$ of the integrand is squarefree. Its
numerator is $w_2=y$, so the resultant of step 3 is
\[
resultant_x(pp_t(resultant_y(y+t(4x^3-1),y^2+x^3-1)),x-x^4)=729t^6(t^2-1)
\]
Its nonzero roots are $\pm 1$, and the integrand has residue 1 at the
place $P$ corrseponding to the point $(x,y)=(0,1)$ and $-1$ at the
place $Q$ corresponding to the point $(x,y)=(0,-1)$ so the divisor
$\delta_1$ of step 5 is $\delta_1=P-Q$. It turns out that $\delta_1$
and $2\delta_1$ are not principal, but that
\[
3\delta_1=\left(\frac{y-1}{y+1}\right)\quad{\rm and}\quad
\frac{y}{x-x^4}-\frac{1}{3}\frac{((y-1)/(y+1))^{'}}{(y-1)/(y+1)}=0
\]
which implies that
\[
\int{\frac{dx}{x\sqrt{1-x^3}}}
=\frac{1}{3}\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{1-x^3}-1}{\sqrt{1-x^3}+1}\right)
\]}

\section{Elementary Functions}
Let $f$ be an arbitrary elementary function. In order to generalize
the algorithms of the previous sections, we need to build an algebraic
model in which $f$ behaves in some sense like a rational or algebraic
function. For that purpose, we need to formally define differential
fields and elementary functions.

\subsection{Differential algebra}
A {\sl differential field} $(K,')$ is a {\sl differential extension} 
of $(K,')$ with a given map $a \rightarrow a'$ from $K$ into $K$,
satisfying $(a+b)'=a'+b'$ and $(ab)'=a'b+ab'$. Such a map is called a
{\sl derivation} on $K$. An element $a \in K$ which satisfies $a'=0$
is called a {\sl constant}, and the set 
Const($K$)$=\{a \in K {\rm\ such\ that\ }a'=0\}$ of all the constants
of $K$ is a subfield of $K$.

A differential field $(E,')$ is a {\sl differential equation} of
$(K,')$ if $K \subseteq E$ and the derivation on $E$ extends the one
on $K$. In that case, an element $t \in E$ is a {\sl monomial} over
$K$ if $t$ is transcendental over $K$ and $t' \in K[t]$, which implies
that both $K[t]$ and $K(t)$ are closed under '. An element $t \in E$
is {\sl elementary over} $K$ if either
\begin{itemize}
\item $t'=b'/b$ for some $b \in K^{*}$, in which case we say that $t$
is a {\sl logarithm} over $K$, and write $t=log(b)$, or
\item $t'=b't$ for some $b \in K^{*}$, in which case we say that $t$
is an {\sl exponential} over $K$, and write $t=e^b$, or
\item $t$ is algebraic over $K$
\end{itemize}

A differential extension $(E,')$ of $(K,')$ is {\sl elementary over}
$K$, if there exist $t_1,\ldots,t_m$ in $E$ such that
$E=K(t_1,\ldots,t_m)$ and each $t_i$ is elementary over
$K(t_1,\ldots,t_{i-1})$. We say that $f \in K$ {\sl has an elementary
integral} over $K$ if there exists an elementary extension $(F,')$ of
$(K,')$ and $g \in F$ such that $g'=f$. An {\sl elementary function}
of the variable $x$ is an element of an elementary extension of the
rational function field $(C(x),d/dx)$, where $C={\rm Const}(C(x))$.

Elementary extensions are useful for modeling any function as a
rational or algebraic function of one main variable over the other
terms present in the function: given an elementary integrand
$f(x)~dx$, the integration algorithm first constructs a field $C$
containing all the constants appearing in $f$, then the rational
function field $(C(x),d/dx)$, then an elementary tower 
$E=C(x)(t_1,\ldots,t_k)$ containing $f$. Note that such a tower is not
unique, and in addition, ajoining a logarithm could in fact adjoin a
new constant, and an exponential could in fact be algebraic, for
example $\mathbb{Q}(x)(log(x),log(2x))=\mathbb{Q}(log(2))(x)(log(x))$
and $\mathbb{Q}(x)(e^{log(x)/2})=\mathbb{Q}(x)(\sqrt{x})$. There are
however algorithms that detect all such occurences and modify the
tower accordingly \cite{16}, so we can assume that all the logarithms
and exponentials appearing in $E$ are monomials, and that 
${\rm Const}(E)=C$. Let now $k_0$ be the largest index such that
$t_{k_0}$ is transcendental over $K=C(x)(t_1,\ldots,t_{k_0-1})$ and
$t=t_{k_0}$. Then $E$ is a finitely generated algebraic extension of
$K(t)$, and in the special case $k_0=k$, $E=K(t)$. Thus, $f \in E$ can
be seen as a univariate rational or algebraic function over $K$, the
major difference with the pure rational or algebraic cases being that
$K$ is not constant with respect to the derivation. It turns out that
the algorithms of the previous section can be generalized to such
towers, new methods being required only for the polynomial (or
integral) part. We note that Liouville's Theorem remains valid when
$E$ is an arbitrary differential field, so the integration algorithms
work by attempting to solve equation (13) as previously.

\noindent
{\bf Example 7} {\sl
The function (1) is the element $f=(t-t^{-1})\sqrt{-1}/2$ of $E=K(t)$
where $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})(x)(t_1,t_2)$ with
\[
t_1=\sqrt{x^3-x+1},\quad t_2=e^{2\sqrt{-1}(x^3-t_1)},\quad{\rm and}\quad
t=e^{((1-t_2)/(1+t_2))-x\sqrt{-1}}
\]
which is transcendental over $K$. Alternatively, it can also be
written as the element $f=2\theta/(1+\theta^2)$ of $F=K(\theta)$ where 
$K==\mathbb{Q}(x)(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ with
\[
\theta_1=\sqrt{x^3-x+1},\quad\theta_2=\tan(x^3-\theta_1),\quad{\rm
and}\quad\theta=\tan\left(\frac{x+\theta_2}{2}\right)
\]
which is a transcendental monomial over $K$. It turns out that both
towers can be used in order to integrate $f$.}

The algorithms of the previous sections relied extensively on
squarefree factorization and on the concept of squarefree
polynomials. The appropriate analogue in monomial extensions is the
notion of {\sl normal} polynomials: let $t$ be a monomial over $K$, we
say that $p\in K[t]$ is {\sl normal} (with respect to ') if
$\gcd(p,p')=1$, and that $p$ is {\sl special} if $\gcd(p,p')=p$, 
{\sl i.e.} $p | p'$ in $K[t]$. For $p \in K[t]$ squarefree, let 
$p_s=\gcd(p,p')$ and $p_n=p/p_s$. Then $p=p_sp_n$, while $p_s$ is
special and $p_n$ is normal. Therefore, squarefree factorization can
be used to write any $q \in K[t]$ as a product $q=q_sq_n$, where
$\gcd(q_s,q_n)=1$, $q_s$ is special and all the squarefree factors of
$q_n$ are normal. We call $q_s$ the {\sl special part} of $q$ and
$q_n$ its {\sl normal part}.

\subsection{The Hermite reduction}
The Hermite reductions we presented for rational and algebraic
functions work in exactly the same way algebraic extensions of
monomial extensions of $K$, as long as we apply them only to the
normal part of the denominator of the integrand. Thus, if $D$ is the
denominator of the integrand, we let $S$ be the special part of $D$,
$D_1D_2^2\ldots D_m^m$ be a squarefree factorization of the {\sl
normal} part of $D$, $V=D_m$, $U=D/V^m$ and the rational and algebraic
Hermite reductions proceed normally, eventually yielding an integrand
whose denominator has a squarefree normal part.

\noindent
{\bf Example 8} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{x-\tan(x)}{\tan(x)^2}}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{x-t}{t^2} \in K(t)\quad {\rm where\ }
K=\mathbb{Q}(x) {\rm\ and\ }t'=t^2+1
\]
Its denominator is $D=t^2$, and $\gcd(t,t')=1$ implying that $t$ is
normal, so $m=2$, $V=t$, $U=D/t^2=1$, and the extended Euclidean
algorithm yields
\[
\frac{A}{1-m}=t-x=-x(t^2+1)+(xt+1)t=-xUV'+(xt+1)V
\]
implying that
\[
\int{\frac{x-\tan(x)}{\tan(x)^2}}~dx=-\frac{x}{\tan(x)}-\int{x}~dx
\]
and the remaining integrand has a squarefree denominator.}

\noindent
{\bf Example 9} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{\log(x)^2+2x\log(x)+x^2+(x+1)\sqrt{x+\log(x)}}
{x\log(x)^2+2x^2\log(x)+x^3}}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{t^2+2xt+x^2+(x+1)y}{xt^2+2x^2t+x^3} \in E
=K(t)[y]/(y^2-x-t)
\]
where $K=\mathbb{Q}(x)$ and $t=log(x)$. The denominator of $f$ with
respect to the basis $w=(1,y)$ is $D=xt^2+2x^2t+x^3$ whose squarefree
factorization is $x(t+x)^2$. Both $x$ and $t+x$ are normal, so $m=2$,
$V=t+x$, $U=D/V^2=x$, and the solution (12) of (8) is
\[
f_1=\frac{t^2+2xt+x^2}{x(-(t'+1))}
=-\frac{t^2+2xt+x^2}{x+1},
\]
\[
f_2=\frac{x+1}{x\left((t+x)\frac{1}{2}\frac{t^{'}+1}{t+z}-(t'+1)\right)}=-2
\]
We have $Q=1$, so $0V+1Q=1$, $A=0$, $R=1$, $RQf_1=f_1=-V^2/(x+1)$ and
$RQf_2=f_2=0V-2$, so $B=-2y$ and
\[
h=f-\left(\frac{B}{V}\right)^{'}=\frac{1}{x}
\]
implying that
\[
\int{\frac{\log(x)^2+2x\log(x)+x^2+(x+1)\sqrt{x+\log(x)}}
{x\log(x)^2+2x^2\log(x)+x^2}}~dx
=\frac{2}{\sqrt{x+log(x)}}+\int{\frac{dx}{x}}
\]
and the remaining integrand has a squarefree denominator.}

\subsection{The polynomial reduction}
In the transcendental case $E=K(t)$ and when $t$ is a monomial
satisfying $deg_t(t') \ge 2$, then it is possible to reduce the
degree of the polynomial part of the integrand until it is smaller
than $deg_t(t')$. In the case when $t=\tan(b)$ for some $b \in K$, then
it is possible either to prove that the integral is not elementary, or
to reduce the polynomial part of the integrand to be in $K$. Let 
$f \in K(t)$ be our integrand and write $f=P+A/D$, where
$P,A,D \in K[t]$ and $deg(A) < deg(D)$. Write 
$P=\sum_{i=1}^e p_it^i$ and $t'=\sum_{i=0}^d c_it^i$ where
$p_0,\ldots,p_e,c_0,\ldots,c_d \in K$, $d \ge 2$, $p_e\ne 0$ and 
$c_d\ne 0$. It is easy to verify that if $e \ge d$, then
\begin{equation}
P=\left(\frac{a_e}{(e-d+1)c_d}t^{e-d_1}\right)^{'}+\overline{P}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{P} \in K[t]$ is such that $\overline{P}=0$ or 
$deg_t(\overline{P}) < e$. Repeating the above transformation we
obtain $Q,R \in K[t]$ such that $R=0$ or $deg_t(R) < d$ and $P=Q'+R$. 
Write then $R=\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} r_it^i$ where
$r_0,\ldots,r_{d-1} \in K$. Again, it is easy to verify that for any
special $S \in K[t]$ with $deg_t(S) > 0$, we have
\[
R=\frac{1}{deg_t(S)}\frac{r_{d-1}}{c_d}\frac{S'}{S}+\overline{R}
\]
where $\overline{R} \in K[t]$ is such that $\overline{R}=0$ or
$deg_t(\overline{R}) < e-1$. Furthermore, it can be proven \cite{4}
that if $R+A/D$ has an elementary integral over $K(t)$, then 
$r_{d-1}/{c_d}$ is a constant, which implies that
\[
\int{R}=\frac{1}{deg_t(S)}\frac{r_{d-1}}{c_d}\log(S)
+\int\left(\overline{R}+\frac{A}{D}\right)
\]
so we are left with an integrand whose polynomial part has degree at
most $deg_t(t')-2$. In this case $t=\tan(b)$ for $b \in K$, then
$t'=b't^2+b'$, so $\overline{R} \in K$.

{\bf Example 10} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int(1+x\tan(x)+\tan(x)^2)~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=1+xt+t^2 \in K(t)\quad{\rm where\ }K=\mathbb{Q}(x)
{\rm\ and\ }t'=t^2+1
\]
Using (15), we get $\overline{P}=f-t'=f-(t^2+1)=xt$ so
\[
\int(1+x\tan(x)+\tan(x)^2)~dx=\tan(x)+\int{x\tan(x)}~dx
\]
and since $x'\ne 0$, the above criterion imples that the remaining
integral is not an elementary function.}

\subsection{The residue criterion}
Similarly to the Hermite reduction, the Rothstein-Trager and
Lazard-Rioboo-Trager algorithms are easy to generalize to the
transcendental case $E=K(t)$ for arbitrary monomials $t$: let 
$f\in K(t)$ be our integrand and write $f=P+A/D+B/S$ where
$P,A,D,B,S \in K[t]$, $deg(A) < deg(D)$, $S$ is special and, following
the Hermite reduction, $D$ is normal. Let then $z$ be a new
indeterminate, $\kappa : K[z] \rightarrow K[z]$ be give by 
$\kappa(\sum_i a_iz^i)=\sum_i a_i^{'}z^i$,
\[
R={\rm resultant_t}(D,A-zD') \in K[z]
\]
be the Rothstein-Trager resultant, $R=R_1R_2^2\ldots R_k^k$ be its
squarefree factorization, $Q_i=\gcd_z(R_i,\kappa(R_i))$ for each $i$,
and 
\[
g=\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{a|Q_i(a)=0} a\log(\gcd{}_t(D,A-aD'))
\]

Note that the roots of each $Q_i$ must all be constants, and that the
arguments of the logarithms can be obtained directly from the
subresultant PRS of $D$ and $A-zD'$ as in the rational function
case. It can then be proven \cite{4} that
\begin{itemize}
\item $f-g'$ is always ``simpler'' than $f$
\item the splitting field of $Q_1\cdots Q_k$ over $K$ is the minimal
algebraic extension of $K$ needed in order to express $\int f$ in the
form (4)
\item if $f$ has an elementary integral over $K(t)$, then 
$R | \kappa(R)$ in $K[z]$ and the denominator of $f-q'$ is special
\end{itemize}
Thus, while in the pure rational function case the remaining integrand
is a polynomial, in this case the remaining integrand has a special
denominator. In that case we have additionally that if its integral is
elementary, then (13) has a solution such that $v\in K(t)$ has a
special denominator, and each $u_i \in K(c_1,\ldots,c_k)[t]$ is
special.

\noindent
{\bf Example 11} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{2\log(x)^2-\log(x)-x^2}{\log(x)^3-x^2\log(x)}}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{2t^2-t-x^2}{t^2-xt^2} \in K(t)\quad
{\rm where\ }K=\mathbb{Q}(x){\rm\ and\ }t=\log(x)
\]
Its denominator is $D=t^3-x^2t$, which is normal, and the resultant is 
\[
\begin{array}{ccl}
R&=&\displaystyle
resultant_t\left(t^3-x^2t,\frac{2x-3z}{x}t^2+(2xz-1)t+x(z-x)\right)\\
&&\\
&=&\displaystyle
4x^3(1-x^2)\left(z^3-xz^2-\frac{1}{4}z+\frac{x}{4}\right)
\end{array}
\]
which is squarefree in $K[z]$. We have
\[
\kappa(R)=-x^2(4(5x^2+3)z^3+8x(3x^2-2)z^2+(5x^2-3)z-2x(3x^2-2))
\]
so
\[
Q_1=\gcd{}_z(R,\kappa R)=x^2\left(z^2-\frac{1}{4}\right)
\]
and
\[
\gcd{}_t\left(t^3+x^2t,\frac{2x-3a}{x}t^2+(2xa-1)t+x(a-x)\right)=t+2ax
\]
where $a^2-1/4=0$, whence
\[
g=\sum_{a|a^2-1/4=0} a\log(t+2ax)=\frac{1}{2}\log(t+x)-\frac{1}{2}\log(t-x)
\]
Computing $f-g'$ we find
\[
\int{\frac{2\log(x)^2-\log(x)-x^2}{\log(x)^3-x^2\log(x)}}~dx
=\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{\log(x)+x}{\log(x)-x}\right)
+\int{\frac{dx}{\log(x)}}
\]
and since $deg_z(Q_1) < deg_z(R)$, it follows that the remaining
integral is not an elementary function (it is in fact the logarithmic
integral $Li(x)$).}

In the most general case, when $E=K(t)(j)$ is algebraic over $K(t)$ and
$y$ is integral over $K[t]$, the criterion part of the above result
remains valid: let $w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ be an integral basis for $E$
over $K(t)$ and write the integrand $f \in E$ as 
$f=\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i/D+\sum_{i=1}^n B_iw_i/S$ where $S$ is special
and, following the Hermite reduction, $D$ is normal. Write 
$\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i=G/H$, where $G \in K[t,y]$ and $H \in K[t]$, let
$F \in K[t,y]$ be the (monic) minimum polynomial for $y$ over $K(t)$,
$z$ be a new indeterminante and compute
\begin{equation}
R(z)={\rm resultant_t}({\rm pp_z}({\rm resultant_y}(G-tHD',F)),D) \in K[t]
\end{equation}
It can then be proven \cite{2} that if $f$ has an elementary integral
over $E$, then $R|\kappa(R)$ in $K[z]$.

{\bf Example 12} {\sl
Consider
\begin{equation}
\int{\frac{\log(1+e^x)^{(1/3)}}{1+\log(1+e^x)}}~dx
\end{equation}
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{y}{t+1} \in E = K(t)[y]/(y^3-t)
\]
where $K=\mathbb{Q}(x)(t_1)$,$t_1=e^x$ and $t=\log(1+t_1)$. Its
denominator with respect to the integral basis $w=(1,y,y^2)$ is
$D=t+1$, which is normal, and the resultant is
\[
R={\rm resultant_t}({\rm pp_z}({\rm resultant_y}(y-zt_1/(1+t_1),y^3-t)),t+1)
=-\frac{t_1^3}{(1+t_1)^3}z^3-1
\]
We have
\[
\kappa(R)=-\frac{3t_1^3}{(1+t_1)^4}z^3
\]
which is coprime with $R$ in $K[z]$, implying that the integral (17)
is not an elementary function.
}

\subsection{The transcendental logarithmic case}
Suppose now that $t=\log(b)$ for some $b \in K^{*}$, and that
$E=K(t)$. Then, every special polynomial must be in $K$, so, following
the residue criterion, we must look for a solution $v \in K[t]$,
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in K(c_1,\ldots,c_n)^{*}$ of (13). Furthermore, the
integrand $f$ is also in $K[t]$, so write
$f=\sum_{i=0}^d f_it^i$ where $f_0,\ldots,f_d \in K$ and $f_d \ne 0$. We
must have $deg{}_t(v) \le d_1$, so writing $v=\sum_{i=0}^{d+1} v_it^i$,
we get 
\[
\int f_dt^d+\cdots+f_1t+f_0=v_{d+1}t^{d+1}+\cdots+v_1t+v_0
+\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\log(u_i)
\]
If $d=0$, then the above is simply an integration problem for 
$f_0 \in K$, which can be solved recursively. Otherwise,
differentiating both sides and equating the coefficients of $t^d$, we
get ${v_{d+1}}'=0$ and
\begin{equation}
f_d=v_d'+(d+1)v_{d+1}\frac{b'}{b}
\end{equation}
Since $f_d \in K$, we can recursively apply the integration algorithm
to $f_d$, either proving that (18) has no solution, in which case $f$
has no elementary integral, or obtaining the constant $v_{d+1}$, and
$v_d$ up to an additive constant (in fact, we apply recursively a
specialized version of the integration algorithm to equations of the
form (18), see \cite{4} for details). Write then
$v_d=\overline{v_d}+c_d$ where $\overline{v_d} \in K$ is known and 
$c_d \in {\rm Const}(K)$ is undetermined. Equating the coefficients of
$t^{d-1}$ yields
\[
f_{d-1}-d\overline{v_d}\frac{b'}{b}={v_{d-1}}'+dc_d\frac{b'}{b}
\]
which is an equation of the form (18), so we again recursively compute
$c_d$ and $v_{d-1}$ up to an additive constant. We repeat this process
until either one of the recursive integrations fails, in which case $f$
has no elementary integral, or we reduce our integrand to an element
of $K$, which is then integrated recursively. The algorithm of this
section can also be applied to real arc-tangent extensions, {\sl i.e.}
$K(t)$ where $t$ is a monomial satisfying $t'=b'/(1+b^2)$ for some 
$b \in K$.

\subsection{The transcendental exponential case}
Suppose now that $t=e^b$ for some $b \in K$, and that $E =
K(t)$. Then, every nonzero special polynomial must be of the form
$at^m$ for $a \in K^{*}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Since
\[
\frac{(at^m)'}{at^m}=\frac{a'}{a}+m\frac{t'}{t}=\frac{a'}{a}+mb'
\]
we must then look for a solution $v\in K[t,t^{-1}]$,
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in K(c_1,\ldots,c_n)^{*}$ of (13). Furthermore, the
integrand $f$ is also in $K[t,t^{-1}]$, so write
$f=\sum_{i=e}^d f_it^i$ where $f_e,\ldots,f_d \in K$ and 
$e,d\in \mathbb{Z}$. Since $(at^{m})'=(a'+mb')t^m$ for any 
$m\in \mathbb{Z}$, we must have $v=Mb+\sum_{i=e}^d v_it^i$ for some
integer $M$, hence
\[
\int\sum_{i=e}^d f_it^i=Mb+\sum_{i=e}^d v_it^i+\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\log(u_i)
\]
Differentiating both sides and equating the coefficients of each power
to $t^d$, we get
\[
f_0=(v_0+Mb)'+\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\frac{u_i^{'}}{u_i}
\]
which is simply an integration problem for $f_0 \in K$, and
\[
f_i=v_i^{'}+ib'v_i\quad{\rm for\ }e \le i \le d, i \ne 0
\]
The above problem is called a {\sl Risch differential equation over
K}. Although solving it seems more complicated than solving $g'=f$, it
is actually simpler than an integration problem because we look for
the solutions $v_i$ in $K$ only rather than in an extension of
$K$. Bronstein \cite{2,3,4} and Risch \cite{12,13,14} describe
algorithms for solving this type of equation when $K$ is an elementary
extension of the rational function field.

\subsection{The transcendental tangent case}
Suppose now that $t=\tan(b)$ for some $b \in K$, {\sl i.e.}
$t'=b'(1+t^2)$, that $\sqrt{-1} \notin K$ and that $E=K(t)$. Then,
every nonzero special polynomial must be of the form $a(t^2+1)^m$ for
$a \in K^{*}$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Since
\[
\frac{(a(t^2+1)^m)'}{a(t^2+1)^m}
=\frac{a'}{a}+m\frac{(t^2+1)'}{t^2+1}
=\frac{a'}{a}+2mb't
\]
we must look for $v=V/(t^2+1)^m$ where $V\in K[t]$, 
$m_1,\ldots,m_k \in \mathbb{N}$, constants 
$c_1,\ldots,c_k \in \overline{K}$ and
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in K(c_1,\ldots,c_k)^{*}$ such that
\[
f=v'+2b't\sum_{i=1}^k c_im_i + \sum_{i=1}^k c_i\frac{u_i^{'}}{u_i}
\]
Furthermore, the integrand $f \in K(t)$ following the residue
criterion must be of the form $f=A/(t^2+1)^M$ where $A \in K[t]$ and
$M \ge 0$. If $M > 0$, it can be shown that $m=M$ and that
\begin{equation}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
c'\\
d'
\end{array}
\right)+
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0&-2mb'\\
2mb'&0\\
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
c\\
d
\end{array}
\right)=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
a\\
b
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
where $at+b$ and $ct+d$ are the remainders module $t^2+1$ of $A$ and
$V$ respectively. The above is a coupled differential system, which
can be solved by methods similar to the ones used for Risch
differential equations \cite{4}. If it has no solution, then the
integral is not elementary, otherwise we reduce the integrand to 
$h \in K[t]$, at which point the polynomial reduction either proves
that its integral is not elementary, or reduce the integrand to an
element of $K$, which is integrated recursively.

\noindent
{\bf Example 13} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{sin(x)}{x}}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{2t/x}{t^2+1} \in K(t)\quad{\rm where\ }K=\mathbb{Q}(x)
{\rm\ and\ }t=\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
\]
Its denominator is $D=t^2+1$, which is special, and the system (19)
becomes 
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
c'\\
d'
\end{array}
\right)+
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0&-1\\
1&0\\
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
c\\
d
\end{array}
\right)=
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
2/x\\
0
\end{array}
\right)
\]
which has no solution in $\mathbb{Q}(x)$, implying that the integral
is not an elementary function.}

\subsection{The algebraic logarithmic case}
The transcendental logarithmic case method also generalizes to the
case when $E=K(t)(y)$ is algebraic over $K(t)$, $t=log(b)$ for 
$b \in K^{*}$ and $y$ is integral over $K[t]$: following the residue
criterion, we can assume that $R | \kappa(R)$ where $R$ is given by
(16), hence that all its roots in $\overline{K}$ are constants. The
polynomial part of the integrand is replace by a family of at most
$[E : K(t)]$ Puiseux expansions at infinity, each of the form
\begin{equation}
a_{-m}\theta^{-m}+\cdots+a_{-1}\theta^{-1}+\sum_{i \ge 0} a_i\theta^i
\end{equation}
where $\theta^r=t^{-1}$ for some positive integer $r$. Applying the
integration algorithm recursively to $a_r \in \overline{K}$, we can
test whether there exist $\rho \in {\rm Const}(\overline{K})$ and 
$v \in \overline{K}$ such that
\[
a_r=v'+\rho\frac{b'}{b}
\]
If there are no such $v$ and $c$ for at least one of the series, then
the integral is not elementary, otherwise $\rho$ is uniquely
determined by $a_r$, so let $\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_q$ where 
$q \le [E : K(t)]$ be the distinct constants we obtain,
$\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_s \in \overline{K}$ be the distinct nonzero
roots of $R$, and $(q_1,\ldots,q_k)$ be a basis for the vector space
generated by the $\rho_i$'s and $\alpha_i$'s over $\mathbb{Q}$. Write
$\alpha_i=r_{i1}q_1+\cdots+r_{ik}q_k$ and 
$\rho_i=s_{i1}q_1+\cdots+s_{ik}q_k$ for each $i$, where 
$r_{ij},s_{ij} \in \mathbb{Q}$ and let $m > 0$ be a common denominator
for all the $r_{ij}$'s and $s_{ij}$'s. For $1 \le j \le k$, let
\[
\delta_j=\sum_{i=1}^s mr_{ij} \sum_l r_lP_l 
-\sum_{i=1}^q ms_{ij} \sum_l s_lQ_l
\]
where $r_l$ is the ramification index of $P_l$, $s_l$ is the
ramification index of $Q_l$, $P_l$ runs over all the finite places at
which $h~dz$ has residue $r_l\alpha_i$ and $Q_l$ runs over all the
infinite places at which $\rho=\rho_i$. As in the pure algebraic case,
if there is a $j$ for which $N\delta_j$ is not principal for any
nonzero integer $N$, then the integral is not elementary, otherwise,
let $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ be nonzero integers such that $n_j\delta_j$ is
principal for each $j$, and
\[
h=f-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^k\frac{q_j}{n_j}\frac{u_j^{'}}{u_j}
\]
where $f$ is the integrand and 
$u_j \in E(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_s,\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_q)^{*}$ is such
that $n_j\delta_j=(u_j)$. If the integral of $h$ is elementary, then
(13) must have a solution with $v \in {\bf O}_{K[x]}$ and
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in \overline{K}$ so we must solve
\begin{equation}
h=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i}{D}
=\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^{'}w_i+\sum_{i=1}^n v_iw_i^{'}
+\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\frac{u_i^{'}}{u_i}
\end{equation}
for $v_1,\ldots,v_n \in K[t]$, constants 
$c_1,\ldots,c_n \in \overline{K}$ and
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in \overline{K}^{*}$ where 
$w=(w_1,\ldots,w_n)$ is an integral basis for $E$ over $K(t)$.

If $E$ is a simple radical extension of $K(t)$, and we use the basis
(11) and the notation of that section, then $w_1=1$ and
\begin{equation}
w_i^{'}=\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\frac{H'}{H}-\frac{D_{i-1}^{'}}{D_{i-1}}\right)w_i
\quad{\rm for\ }1 \le i \le n
\end{equation}
This implies that (21) becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{A_1}{D}=v_1^{'}+\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\frac{u_i^{'}}{u_i}
\end{equation}
which is simply an integration problem for $A_1/D \in K(t)$, and
\begin{equation}
\frac{A_i}{D}=v_i^{'}+\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\frac{H'}{H}
-\frac{D_{i-1}^{'}}{D_{i-1}}\right)v_i\quad{\rm for\ }1 < i \le n
\end{equation}
which are Risch differential equations over $K(t)$

\noindent
{\bf Example 14} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{(x^2+2x+1)\sqrt{x+\log(x)}+(3x+1)\log(x)+3x^2+x}
{(x\log(x)+x^2)\sqrt{x+\log(x)}+x^2\log(x)+x^3}}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{((3x+1)t-x^3+x^2)y-(2x^2-x-1)t-2x^3+x^2+x}
{xt^2-(x^3-2x^2)t-x^4+x^3} \in E = K(t)[y]/(F)
\]
where $F=y^2-x-t$, $K=\mathbb{Q}(x)$ and $t=\log(x)$. Its denominator
with respect to the integral basis $w=(1,y)$ is
$D=xt^2-(x^3-2x^2)t-x^4+x^3$, which is normal, and the resultant is
\[
\begin{array}{ccl}
R&=&{\rm resultant_t}({\rm pp_z}({\rm resultant_y}(((3x+1)t-x^3+x^2)y\\
&&\\
&&\hbox{\hskip 2.0cm}
-(2x^2-x-1)t-2x^3+x^2+x-zD^{'},F)),D)\\
&&\\
&=&x^{12}(2x+1)^2(x+1)^2(x-1)^2z^3(z-2)\\
\end{array}
\]
We have
\[
\kappa(R)=\frac{36x^3+16x^2-28x-12}{x(2x+1)(x+1)(x-1)}R
\]
so $R | \kappa(R)$ in $K[z]$. Its only nonzero root is 2, and the
integrand has residue 2 at the place $P$ corresponding to the point
$(t,y)=(x^2-x,-x)$. There is only one place $Q$ at infinity of
ramification index 2, and the coefficient of $t^{-1}$ in the Puiseux
expansion of $f$ at $Q$ is
\[
a_2=1-2x+\frac{1}{x}=(x-x^2)'+\frac{x'}{x}
\]
which implies that the corresponding $\rho$ is 1. Therefore, the
divisor for the logand is $\delta=2P-2Q$. It turns out that 
$\delta=(u)$ where $u=(x+y)^2 \in E^{*}$, so the new integrand is
\[
h=f-\frac{u'}{u}=f-2\frac{(x+y)'}{x+y}=\frac{(x+1)y}{xt+x^2}
\]
We have $y^2=t+x$, which is squarefree, so (23) becomes
\[
0=v_1^{'}+\sum_{i=1}^k c_i\frac{u_i^{'}}{u_i}
\]
whose solution is $v_1=k=0$ and (24) becomes
\[
\frac{x+1}{xt+x^2}=v_2^{'}+\frac{x+1}{2xt+2x^2}v_2
\]
whose solution is $v_2=2$, implying that $h=2y'$, hence that
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle
\int{\frac{(x^2+2x+1)\sqrt{x+\log(x)}+(3x+1)\log(x)+3x^2+x}
{(x\log(x)+x^2)\sqrt{x+\log(x)}+x^2\log(x)+x^3}}~dx\\
\\
\displaystyle
\hbox{\hskip 4.0cm}2\sqrt{x+\log(x)}+2\log\left(x+\sqrt{x+\log(x)}\right)
\end{array}
\]}
In the general case when $E$ is not a radical extension of $K(t)$, 
(21) is solved by bounding $deg_t(v_i)$ and comparing the Puiseux
expansions at infinity of $\sum_{i=1}^n v_iw_i$ with those of the form
(20) of $h$, see \cite{2,12} for details.

\subsection{The algebraic exponential case}
The transcendental exponential case method also generalizes to the
case when $E=K(t)(y)$ is algebraic over $K(t)$, $t=e^b$ for $b \in K$
and $y$ is integral over $K[t]$: following the residue criterion, we
can assume that $R|\kappa(R)$ where $R$ is given by (16), hence that
all its roots in $\overline{K}$ are constants. The denominator of the
integrancd must be of the form $D=t^mU$ where $\gcd(U,t)=1$, $U$ is
squarefree and $m \ge 0$.

If $m > 0$, $E$ is a simple radical extension of $K(t)$, and we use the
basis (11), then it is possible to reduce the power of $t$ appearing
in $D$ by a process similar to the Hermite reduction: writing the
integrand $f=\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i/(t^mU)$, we ask whether we can
compute $b_1,\ldots,b_n \in K$ and $C_1,\ldots,C_n \in K[t]$ such that
\[
\int\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i}{t^mU}
=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n b_iw_i}{t^m}
+\int{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n C_iw_i}{t^{m-1}U}}
\]
Differentiating both sides and multiplying through by $t^m$ we get
\[
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n A_iw_i}{U}
=\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^{'}w_i+\sum_{i=1}^n b_iw_i^{'}
-mb'\sum_{i=1}^n b_iw_i+\frac{t\sum_{i=1}^n C_iw_i}{U}
\]
Using (22) and equating the coefficients of $w_i$ on both sides, we
get
\begin{equation}
\frac{A_i}{U}=b_i^{'}+(\omega_i-mb')b_i+\frac{tC_i}{U}
\quad{\rm for\ }1 \le i \le n
\end{equation}
where
\[
\omega_i=\frac{i-1}{n}\frac{H'}{H}-\frac{D_{i-1}^{'}}{D_{i-1}} \in K(t)
\]
Since $t'/t=b' \in K$, it follows that the denominator of $\omega_i$
is not divisible by $t$ in $K[t]$, hence, evaluating (25) at $t=0$, we
get 
\begin{equation}
\frac{A_i(0)}{U(0)}=b_i^{'}+(\omega_i(0)-mb')b_i
\quad{\rm for\ }1 \le i \le n
\end{equation}
which are Risch differential equations over $K(t)$. If any of them has
no solution in $K(t)$, then the integral is not elementary, otherwise
we repeat this process until the denominator of the integrand is
normal. We then perform the change of variabl $\overline{t}=t^{-1}$,
which is also exponential over $K$ since
$\overline{t}'=-b'\overline{t}$, and repeat the above process in order
to eliminate the power of $\overline{t}$ from the denominator of the
integrand. It can be shown that after this process, any solution of
(13) must have $v \in K$.

\noindent
{\bf Example 15} {\sl
Consider
\[
\int{\frac{3(x+e^x)^{(1/3)}+(2x^2+3x)e^x+5x^2}{x(x+e^x)^{(1/3)}}}~dx
\]
The integrand is
\[
f=\frac{((2x^2+3x)t+5x^2)y^2+3t+3x}{xt+x^2} \in E
=K(t)[y]/(y^3-t-x)
\]
where $K=\mathbb{Q}(x)$ and $t=e^x$. Its denominator with respect to
the integral basis $w=(1,y,y^2)$ is $D=xt+x^2$, which is normal, and the
resultant is
\[
\begin{array}{l}
R={\rm resultant_t}({\rm pp_z}({\rm resultant_y}
(((2x^2+3x)t+5x^2)y^2+3t+3x-zD',\\
\hbox{\hskip 5.0cm}y^3-t-x)),D)=x^8(1-x)^3z^3
\end{array}
\]
We have
\[
\kappa(R)=\frac{11x-8}{x(x-1)}R
\]
so $R|\kappa(R)$ in $K[z]$, its only root being 0. Since $D$ is not
divisible by $t$, let $\overline{t}=t^{-1}$ and $z=\overline{t}y$. We
have $\overline{t}'=-\overline{t}$ and 
$z^3-\overline{t}^2-x\overline{t}^3=0$, so the integral basis (11) is
\[
\overline{w}=(\overline{w}_1,\overline{w}_2,\overline{w}_3)
=\left(1,z,\frac{z^2}{\overline{t}}\right)
\]
Writing $f$ in terms of that basis gives
\[
f=\frac{3x\overline{t}^2+3\overline{t}
+(5x^2\overline{t}+2x^2+3x)\overline{w}_3}
{x^2\overline{t}^2+x\overline{t}}
\]
whose denominator $\overline{D}=\overline{t}(x+x^2\overline{t})$ is
divisible by $\overline{t}$. We have
$H=\overline{t}^2(1+x\overline{t})$ so $D_0=D_1=1$ and
$D_2=\overline{t}$, implying that
\[
\omega_1=0, \omega_2=\frac{(1-3x)\overline{t}-2}{3x\overline{t}+3},
{\rm\ and\ } \omega_3=\frac{(2-3x)\overline{t}-1}{3x\overline{t}+3}
\]
Therefore the equations (26) become
\[
0=b_1^{'}+b_1,0=b_2^{'}+\frac{1}{3}b_2,{\rm\ and\ }
2x+3=b_3^{'}+\frac{2}{3}b_3
\]
whose solutions are $b_1=b_2=0$ and $b_3=3x$, implying that the new
integrand is
\[
h=f-\left(\frac{3x\overline{w}_3}{\overline{t}}\right)^{'}=\frac{3}{x}
\]
hence that
\[
\int{\frac{3(x+e^x)^{(1/3)}+(2x^2+3x)e^x+5x^2}{x(x+e^x)^{(1/3)}}}~dx
=3x(x+e^x)^{(2/3)}+3\int{\frac{dx}{x}}
\]
}

In the general case when $E$ is not a radical extension of $K(t)$,
following the Hermite reduction, any solution of (13) must have
$v=\sum_{i=1}^n v_iw_i/t^m$ where $v_1,\ldots,v_m \in K[t]$. We can
compute $v$ by bounding $deg_t(v_i)$ and comparing the Puiseux
expansions at $t=0$ and at infinity of $\sum_{i=1}^n v_iw_i/t^m$ with
those of the form (20) of the integrand, see \cite{2,12} for details.

Once we are reduced to solving (13) for $v \in K$, constants
$c_1,\ldots,c_k \in \overline{K}$ and 
$u_1,\ldots,u_k \in E(c_1,\ldots,c_k)^{*}$, constants
$\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_s \in \overline{K}$ can be determined at all the
places above $t=0$ and at infinity in a manner similar to the
algebraic logarithmic case, at which point the algorithm proceeds by
constructing the divisors $\delta_j$ and the $u_j$'s as in that
case. Again, the details are quite technical and can be found in 
\cite{2,12,13}.

++ Description:
++ The notion of aggregate serves to model any data structure aggregate,
++ designating any collection of objects,
++ with heterogenous or homogeneous members,
++ with a finite or infinite number
++ of members, explicitly or implicitly represented.
++ An aggregate can in principle
++ represent everything from a string of characters to abstract sets such
++ as "the set of x satisfying relation {\em r(x)}"
++ An attribute \spadatt{finiteAggregate} is used to assert that a domain
++ has a finite number of elements.
Aggregate: Category == Type with
   eq?: (%,%) -> Boolean
     ++ eq?(u,v) tests if u and v are same objects.
   copy: % -> %
     ++ copy(u) returns a top-level (non-recursive) copy of u.
     ++ Note: for collections, \axiom{copy(u) == [x for x in u]}.
   empty: () -> %
     ++ empty()$D creates an aggregate of type D with 0 elements.
     ++ Note: The {\em $D} can be dropped if understood by context,
     ++ e.g. \axiom{u: D := empty()}.
   empty?: % -> Boolean
     ++ empty?(u) tests if u has 0 elements.
   less?: (%,NonNegativeInteger) -> Boolean
     ++ less?(u,n) tests if u has less than n elements.
   more?: (%,NonNegativeInteger) -> Boolean
     ++ more?(u,n) tests if u has greater than n elements.
   size?: (%,NonNegativeInteger) -> Boolean
     ++ size?(u,n) tests if u has exactly n elements.
   sample: constant -> %    ++ sample yields a value of type %
   if % has finiteAggregate then
     "#": % -> NonNegativeInteger     ++ # u returns the number of items in u.

\section{ALAGG.lsp BOOTSTRAP}
{\bf ALAGG} depends on a chain of files. We need to break this cycle to build
the algebra. So we keep a cached copy of the translated {\bf ALAGG}
category which we can write into the {\bf MID} directory. We compile 
the lisp code and copy the {\bf ALAGG.o} file to the {\bf OUT} directory.
This is eventually forcibly replaced by a recompiled version. 

Note that this code is not included in the generated catdef.spad file.

++ One-dimensional-array aggregates serves as models for one-dimensional 
++ arrays. Categorically, these aggregates are finite linear aggregates
++ with the \spadatt{shallowlyMutable} property, that is, any component of
++ the array may be changed without affecting the
++ identity of the overall array.
++ Array data structures are typically represented by a fixed area in storage 
++ and cannot efficiently grow or shrink on demand as can list structures
++ (see however \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for a data structure which
++ is a cross between a list and an array).
++ Iteration over, and access to, elements of arrays is extremely fast
++ (and often can be optimized to open-code).
++ Insertion and deletion however is generally slow since an entirely new
++ data structure must be created for the result.

++ Description:
++ A collection is a homogeneous aggregate which can built from
++ list of members. The operation used to build the aggregate is
++ generically named \spadfun{construct}. However, each collection
++ provides its own special function with the same name as the
++ data type, except with an initial lower case letter, e.g.
++ \spadfun{list} for \spadtype{List},
++ \spadfun{flexibleArray} for \spadtype{FlexibleArray}, and so on.
Collection(S:Type): Category == HomogeneousAggregate(S) with
   construct: List S -> %
     ++ \axiom{construct(x,y,...,z)} returns the collection of elements \axiom{x,y,...,z}
     ++ ordered as given. Equivalently written as \axiom{[x,y,...,z]$D}, where
     ++ D is the domain. D may be omitted for those of type List.
   find: (S->Boolean, %) -> Union(S, "failed")
     ++ find(p,u) returns the first x in u such that \axiom{p(x)} is true, and
     ++ "failed" otherwise.
   if % has finiteAggregate then
      reduce: ((S,S)->S,%) -> S
	++ reduce(f,u) reduces the binary operation f across u. For example,
	++ if u is \axiom{[x,y,...,z]} then \axiom{reduce(f,u)} 
        ++ returns \axiom{f(..f(f(x,y),...),z)}.
	++ Note: if u has one element x, \axiom{reduce(f,u)} returns x.
	++ Error: if u is empty.
        ++
        ++C )clear all
        ++X reduce(+,[C[i]*x**i for i in 1..5])

      reduce: ((S,S)->S,%,S) -> S
	++ reduce(f,u,x) reduces the binary operation f across u, where x is
	++ the identity operation of f.
	++ Same as \axiom{reduce(f,u)} if u has 2 or more elements.
	++ Returns \axiom{f(x,y)} if u has one element y,
	++ x if u is empty.
	++ For example, \axiom{reduce(+,u,0)} returns the
	++ sum of the elements of u.
      remove: (S->Boolean,%) -> %
	++ remove(p,u) returns a copy of u removing all elements x such that
	++ \axiom{p(x)} is true.
	++ Note: \axiom{remove(p,u) == [x for x in u | not p(x)]}.
      select: (S->Boolean,%) -> %
	++ select(p,u) returns a copy of u containing only those elements such
	++ \axiom{p(x)} is true.
	++ Note: \axiom{select(p,u) == [x for x in u | p(x)]}.
      if S has SetCategory then
	reduce: ((S,S)->S,%,S,S) -> S
	  ++ reduce(f,u,x,z) reduces the binary operation f across u, stopping
	  ++ when an "absorbing element" z is encountered.
	  ++ As for \axiom{reduce(f,u,x)}, x is the identity operation of f.
	  ++ Same as \axiom{reduce(f,u,x)} when u contains no element z.
	  ++ Thus the third argument x is returned when u is empty.
	remove: (S,%) -> %
	  ++ remove(x,u) returns a copy of u with all
	  ++ elements \axiom{y = x} removed.
	  ++ Note: \axiom{remove(y,c) == [x for x in c | x ^= y]}.
	removeDuplicates: % -> %
	  ++ removeDuplicates(u) returns a copy of u with all duplicates 
          ++ removed.

{\bf CLAGG} depends on a chain of files. We need to break this cycle to build
the algebra. So we keep a cached copy of the translated {\bf CLAGG}
category which we can write into the {\bf MID} directory. We compile 
the lisp code and copy the {\bf CLAGG.o} file to the {\bf OUT} directory.
This is eventually forcibly replaced by a recompiled version. 

Note that this code is not included in the generated catdef.spad file.

++ Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive

++ argument, whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both

\section{LNAGG.lsp BOOTSTRAP}
{\bf LNAGG} depends on a chain of files. We need to break this cycle to build
the algebra. So we keep a cached copy of the translated {\bf LNAGG}
category which we can write into the {\bf MID} directory. We compile 
the lisp code and copy the {\bf LNAGG.o} file to the {\bf OUT} directory.
This is eventually forcibly replaced by a recompiled version. 

Note that this code is not included in the generated catdef.spad file.

{\bf LNAGG-} depends on {\bf LNAGG}. We need to break this cycle to build
the algebra. So we keep a cached copy of the translated {\bf LNAGG-}
category which we can write into the {\bf MID} directory. We compile 
the lisp code and copy the {\bf LNAGG-.o} file to the {\bf OUT} directory.
This is eventually forcibly replaced by a recompiled version. 

Note that this code is not included in the generated catdef.spad file.

++ Description:
++ A recursive aggregate over a type S is a model for a
++ a directed graph containing values of type S.
++ Recursively, a recursive aggregate is a {\em node}
++ consisting of a \spadfun{value} from S and 0 or more \spadfun{children}
++ which are recursive aggregates.
++ A node with no children is called a \spadfun{leaf} node.
++ A recursive aggregate may be cyclic for which some operations as noted
++ may go into an infinite loop.
RecursiveAggregate(S:Type): Category == HomogeneousAggregate(S) with
   children: % -> List %
     ++ children(u) returns a list of the children of aggregate u.
   -- should be % -> %* and also needs children: % -> Iterator(S,S)
   nodes: % -> List %
     ++ nodes(u) returns a list of all of the nodes of aggregate u.
   -- to become % -> %* and also nodes: % -> Iterator(S,S)
   leaf?: % -> Boolean
     ++ leaf?(u) tests if u is a terminal node.
   value: % -> S
     ++ value(u) returns the value of the node u.
   elt: (%,"value") -> S
     ++ elt(u,"value") (also written: \axiom{a. value}) is
     ++ equivalent to \axiom{value(a)}.
   cyclic?: % -> Boolean
     ++ cyclic?(u) tests if u has a cycle.
   leaves: % -> List S
     ++ leaves(t) returns the list of values in obtained by visiting the
     ++ nodes of tree \axiom{t} in left-to-right order.
   distance: (%,%) -> Integer
     ++ distance(u,v) returns the path length (an integer) from node u to v.
   if S has SetCategory then
      child?: (%,%) -> Boolean
	++ child?(u,v) tests if node u is a child of node v.
      node?: (%,%) -> Boolean
	++ node?(u,v) tests if node u is contained in node v
	++ (either as a child, a child of a child, etc.).
   if % has shallowlyMutable then
      setchildren_!: (%,List %)->%
	++ setchildren!(u,v) replaces the current children of node u
	++ with the members of v in left-to-right order.
      setelt: (%,"value",S) -> S
	++ setelt(a,"value",x) (also written \axiom{a . value := x})
	++ is equivalent to \axiom{setvalue!(a,x)}
      setvalue_!: (%,S) -> S

++ A string aggregate is a category for strings, that is,
++ one dimensional arrays of characters.
StringAggregate: Category == OneDimensionalArrayAggregate Character with
    lowerCase	    : % -> %
      ++ lowerCase(s) returns the string with all characters in lower case.
    lowerCase_!: % -> %
      ++ lowerCase!(s) destructively replaces the alphabetic characters
      ++ in s by lower case.
    upperCase	    : % -> %
      ++ upperCase(s) returns the string with all characters in upper case.
    upperCase_!: % -> %
      ++ upperCase!(s) destructively replaces the alphabetic characters
      ++ in s by upper case characters.
    prefix?	    : (%, %) -> Boolean
      ++ prefix?(s,t) tests if the string s is the initial substring of t.
      ++ Note: \axiom{prefix?(s,t) == 
      ++   reduce(and,[s.i = t.i for i in 0..maxIndex s])}.
    suffix?	    : (%, %) -> Boolean
      ++ suffix?(s,t) tests if the string s is the final substring of t.
      ++ Note: \axiom{suffix?(s,t) == 
      ++  reduce(and,[s.i = t.(n - m + i) for i in 0..maxIndex s])}
      ++ where m and n denote the maxIndex of s and t respectively.
    substring?: (%, %, Integer) -> Boolean
      ++ substring?(s,t,i) tests if s is a substring of t beginning at
      ++ index i.
      ++ Note: \axiom{substring?(s,t,0) = prefix?(s,t)}.
    match: (%, %, Character) -> NonNegativeInteger
      ++ match(p,s,wc) tests if pattern \axiom{p} matches subject \axiom{s}
      ++ where \axiom{wc} is a wild card character. If no match occurs,
      ++ the index \axiom{0} is returned; otheriwse, the value returned
      ++ is the first index of the first character in the subject matching
      ++ the subject (excluding that matched by an initial wild-card).
      ++ For example, \axiom{match("*to*","yorktown","*")} returns \axiom{5}
      ++ indicating a successful match starting at index \axiom{5} of
      ++ \axiom{"yorktown"}.
    match?: (%, %, Character) -> Boolean
      ++ match?(s,t,c) tests if s matches t except perhaps for
      ++ multiple and consecutive occurrences of character c.
      ++ Typically c is the blank character.
    replace	    : (%, UniversalSegment(Integer), %) -> %
      ++ replace(s,i..j,t) replaces the substring \axiom{s(i..j)} 
      ++ of s by string t.
    position	    : (%, %, Integer) -> Integer
      ++ position(s,t,i) returns the position j of the substring s in string t,
      ++ where \axiom{j >= i} is required.
    position	    : (CharacterClass, %, Integer) -> Integer
      ++ position(cc,t,i) returns the position \axiom{j >= i} in t of
      ++ the first character belonging to cc.
    coerce	    : Character -> %
      ++ coerce(c) returns c as a string s with the character c.

    split: (%, Character) -> List %
      ++ split(s,c) returns a list of substrings delimited by character c.
    split: (%, CharacterClass) -> List %
      ++ split(s,cc) returns a list of substrings delimited by 
      ++ characters in cc.

    trim: (%, Character) -> %
      ++ trim(s,c) returns s with all characters c deleted from right
      ++ and left ends.
      ++ For example, \axiom{trim(" abc ", char " ")} returns \axiom{"abc"}.
    trim: (%, CharacterClass) -> %
      ++ trim(s,cc) returns s with all characters in cc deleted from right
      ++ and left ends.
      ++ For example, \axiom{trim("(abc)", charClass "()")} 
      ++ returns \axiom{"abc"}.
    leftTrim: (%, Character) -> %
      ++ leftTrim(s,c) returns s with all leading characters c deleted.
      ++ For example, \axiom{leftTrim("  abc  ", char " ")} 
      ++ returns \axiom{"abc  "}.
    leftTrim: (%, CharacterClass) -> %
      ++ leftTrim(s,cc) returns s with all leading characters in cc deleted.
      ++ For example, \axiom{leftTrim("(abc)", charClass "()")} 
      ++ returns \axiom{"abc)"}.
    rightTrim: (%, Character) -> %
      ++ rightTrim(s,c) returns s with all trailing occurrences of c deleted.
      ++ For example, \axiom{rightTrim("  abc  ", char " ")} 
      ++ returns \axiom{"  abc"}.
    rightTrim: (%, CharacterClass) -> %
      ++ rightTrim(s,cc) returns s with all trailing occurences of
      ++ characters in cc deleted.
      ++ For example, \axiom{rightTrim("(abc)", charClass "()")} 
      ++ returns \axiom{"(abc"}.
    elt: (%, %) -> %
      ++ elt(s,t) returns the concatenation of s and t. It is provided to
      ++ allow juxtaposition of strings to work as concatenation.
      ++ For example, \axiom{"smoo" "shed"} returns \axiom{"smooshed"}.
 add

++ Description:
++ A unary-recursive aggregate is a one where nodes may have either
++ 0 or 1 children.
++ This aggregate models, though not precisely, a linked
++ list possibly with a single cycle.
++ A node with one children models a non-empty list, with the
++ \spadfun{value} of the list designating the head, or \spadfun{first}, of the
++ list, and the child designating the tail, or \spadfun{rest}, of the list.
++ A node with no child then designates the empty list.
++ Since these aggregates are recursive aggregates, they may be cyclic.
UnaryRecursiveAggregate(S:Type): Category == RecursiveAggregate S with

      ++ the elements of u.
      ++ Note: if \axiom{v = concat(x,u)} then \axiom{x = first v}
      ++ and \axiom{u = rest v}.
   first: % -> S
      ++ first(u) returns the first element of u
      ++ (equivalently, the value at the current node).
   elt: (%,"first") -> S
      ++ elt(u,"first") (also written: \axiom{u . first}) 
      ++ is equivalent to first u.
   first: (%,NonNegativeInteger) -> %
      ++ first(u,n) returns a copy of the first n (\axiom{n >= 0}) 
      ++ elements of u.
   rest: % -> %
      ++ rest(u) returns an aggregate consisting of all but the first
      ++ element of u
      ++ (equivalently, the next node of u).
   elt: (%,"rest") -> %
      ++ elt(%,"rest") (also written: \axiom{u.rest}) is
      ++ equivalent to \axiom{rest u}.
   rest: (%,NonNegativeInteger) -> %
      ++ rest(u,n) returns the \axiom{n}th (n >= 0) node of u.
      ++ Note: \axiom{rest(u,0) = u}.
   last: % -> S
      ++ last(u) resturn the last element of u.
      ++ Note: for lists, \axiom{last(u) = u . (maxIndex u) = u . (# u - 1)}.
   elt: (%,"last") -> S
      ++ elt(u,"last") (also written: \axiom{u . last}) is equivalent 
      ++ to last u.
   last: (%,NonNegativeInteger) -> %
      ++ last(u,n) returns a copy of the last n (\axiom{n >= 0}) nodes of u.
      ++ Note: \axiom{last(u,n)} is a list of n elements.
   tail: % -> %
      ++ tail(u) returns the last node of u.
      ++ Note: if u is \axiom{shallowlyMutable},
      ++ \axiom{setrest(tail(u),v) = concat(u,v)}.
   second: % -> S
      ++ second(u) returns the second element of u.
      ++ Note: \axiom{second(u) = first(rest(u))}.
   third: % -> S
      ++ third(u) returns the third element of u.
      ++ Note: \axiom{third(u) = first(rest(rest(u)))}.
   cycleEntry: % -> %
      ++ cycleEntry(u) returns the head of a top-level cycle contained in
      ++ aggregate u, or \axiom{empty()} if none exists.
   cycleLength: % -> NonNegativeInteger
      ++ cycleLength(u) returns the length of a top-level cycle
      ++ contained  in aggregate u, or 0 is u has no such cycle.
   cycleTail: % -> %
      ++ cycleTail(u) returns the last node in the cycle, or
      ++ empty if none exists.
   if % has shallowlyMutable then
      concat_!: (%,%) -> %
	++ concat!(u,v) destructively concatenates v to the end of u.
	++ Note: \axiom{concat!(u,v) = setlast_!(u,v)}.
      concat_!: (%,S) -> %
	++ concat!(u,x) destructively adds element x to the end of u.
	++ Note: \axiom{concat!(a,x) = setlast!(a,[x])}.
      cycleSplit_!: % -> %
	++ cycleSplit!(u) splits the aggregate by dropping off the cycle.
	++ The value returned is the cycle entry, or nil if none exists.
	++ For example, if \axiom{w = concat(u,v)} is the cyclic list where 
	++ v is the head of the cycle, \axiom{cycleSplit!(w)} will drop v 
	++ off w thus destructively changing w to u, and returning v.
      setfirst_!: (%,S) -> S
	++ setfirst!(u,x) destructively changes the first element of a to x.
      setelt: (%,"first",S) -> S
	++ setelt(u,"first",x) (also written: \axiom{u.first := x}) is
	++ equivalent to \axiom{setfirst!(u,x)}.
      setrest_!: (%,%) -> %
	++ setrest!(u,v) destructively changes the rest of u to v.
      setelt: (%,"rest",%) -> %
	++ setelt(u,"rest",v) (also written: \axiom{u.rest := v}) is 
	++ equivalent to \axiom{setrest!(u,v)}.
      setlast_!: (%,S) -> S

      setelt: (%,"last",S) -> S
	++ setelt(u,"last",x) (also written: \axiom{u.last := b})
	++ is equivalent to \axiom{setlast!(u,v)}.

	 ++ and \axiom{w = first(u,n)}, returning \axiom{v}.

{\bf URAGG} depends on a chain of files. We need to break this cycle to build
the algebra. So we keep a cached copy of the translated {\bf URAGG}
category which we can write into the {\bf MID} directory. We compile 
the lisp code and copy the {\bf URAGG.o} file to the {\bf OUT} directory.
This is eventually forcibly replaced by a recompiled version.
