{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.

\chapter{Overview}
\label{Overview}
This book contains 5 programs, all related to the graphics subsystem.

The primary 2D graphics routines live in the program ``view2d''
(See Section \ref{view2d} on page~\pageref{view2d}).
The primary 3d graphics routines live in the program ``view3d''
(See Section \ref{view3d} on page~\pageref{view3d}).
These two programs can be run under the control of sman using the
program ``viewman''
(See Section \ref{viewman} on page~\pageref{viewman}).
They can also be run standalone using the program ``viewalone''
(See Section \ref{viewalone} on page~\pageref{viewalone}).


\begin{itemize}
\item viewman/viewman.c.pamphlet -- int main (void)
\item viewalone/viewalone.c.pamphlet -- int main (int argc,char *argv[])
\item view2d/main2d.c.pamphlet -- int main(void) 
\item view3d/main3d.c.pamphlet -- int main(void) 
\item view3d/testcol.c.pamphlet -- void main(void) 
\end{itemize}

The section ``gdraws'' 
(see \ref{gdraws} on page~\pageref{gdraws})
contains a set of functions for handling 
postscript generation. This is handled by defining a set of cover
functions for the X routines, as in GDrawArc versus XDrawArc.
When the Xoption is set the X routine is called. When the PSoption 
is set the postscript routines are generated.

\section{Standard Curves and Surfaces}
In order to have an organized and thorough evaluation of the Axiom
graphics code we turn to the CRC Standard Curves and Surfaces\cite{8} (SCC).
This volume was written years after the Axiom graphics code was written so
there was no attempt to match the two until now. However, the SCC volume
will give us a solid foundation to both evaluate the features of the 
current code and suggest future directions.

According to the SCC we can organize the various curves by the taxonomy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] {\bf random}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1.1] {\bf fractal}
\item[1.2] {\bf gaussian}
\item[1.3] {\bf non-gaussian}
\end{enumerate}
\item[2] {\bf determinate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.1] {\bf algebraic} -- A polynomial is defined as a summation of terms
composed of integral powers of $x$ and $y$. An algebraic curve is one whose
implicit function 
\[f(x,y)=0\] is a polynomial in $x$ and $y$ (after rationalization, if
necessary). Because a curve is often defined in the explicit form
\[y=f(x)\] there is a need to distinguish rational and irrational 
functions of $x$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.1.1] {\bf irrational} -- An irrational function of $x$ is a quotient
of two polynomials, one or both of which has a term (or terms) with power
$p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers.
\item[2.1.2] {\bf rational} -- A rational function of $x$ is a quotient of two
polynomials in $x$, both having only integer powers.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.1.2.1] {\bf polynomial}
\item[2.1.2.2] {\bf non-polynomial}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item[2.2] {\bf integral} -- Certain continuous functions are not expressible 
in algebraic or transcendental forms but are familiar mathematical tools. 
These curves are equal to the integrals of algebraic or transcendental 
curves by definition; examples include Bessel functions, Airy integrals, 
Fresnel integrals, and the error function.
\item[2.3] {\bf transcendental} -- The transcendental curves cannot be 
expressed as polynomials in $x$ and $y$. These are curves containing one 
or more of the following forms: exponential ($e^x$), 
logarithmic ($\log(x)$), or trigonometric ($\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$). 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.3.1] {\bf exponential}
\item[2.3.2] {\bf logarithmic}
\item[2.3.3] {\bf trigonometric}
\end{enumerate}
\item[2.4] {\bf piecewise continuous} -- Other curves, except at a few 
singular points, are smooth and differentiable. The class of 
nondifferentiable curves have discontinuity of the first derivative as a 
basic attribute. They are often composed of straight-line segments. 
Simple polygonal forms, regular fractal curves, and turtle tracks are 
examples.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.4.1] {\bf periodic}
\item[2.4.2] {\bf non-periodic}
\item[2.4.3] {\bf polygonal}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[2.4.3.1] {\bf regular}
\item[2.4.3.2] {\bf irregular}
\item[2.4.3.3] {\bf fractal}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Pre-release change history}
\begin{verbatim}
This directory contains the C source code for the Scratchpad's
graphics. Comments given to the maintenance program refer to 
version numbers. The versions are documented below, starting with
version23.
\begin{verbatim}
version23: (first version after returning from Europe)
   added a $DEVE environment variable - if it exists, the viewport manager 
   tries those executable files first; if it was unsuccessful or, if the 
   $DEVE variable was not defined, the $AXIOM variable is used tube.c: 
   changed order of crossedLines(p,q... to crossedLines(q,p... in order to
   use segNum info (which segment of the second polygon the first polygon 
   crosses) and using splitPolygon() rather than splitAndMove()
   tube.c: changed crossedLines() to generalPartialSplit() - an algorithms 
   i hope would work. it is not taken from any literature as all the 
   literature i have looked into and tried out had design flaws or lacked 
   precise specifications (including Foley & van Dam volume I, Newman & 
   Sprouill and others) 
   viewport3D.c: xPts now malloced as a global variable in makeView3D and 
   not freed up at the end. quadMesh is also not freed anymore (shouldn't 
   be as it was changed to a global some time ago).
   made eyeDistance (3D stuff) into a float (from integer)
   added outlineRender (outlineOnOff in actions.h) field. note that this 
   and the previous change both affected the following files:
      view3d/: main.c, process.c, viewport3D.c, spadAction.c, write.c
      viewman/: fun3d.c make3d.c
      viewalone/: spoon3D.c spoonTube.c
      spad/: view3d.spad (viewport3D, makeViewport3D and the Rep)
   3D: ability to write Stellar recognizable data files for Tube types
   spad additions: write(v,fn,listOfTypes)
   fixed perspective, added min/max range of eyeDistance

version24: view3d/tube.c: put in calculations for xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax
   >>> took them out again - doesn't the viewport manager do that?
   polygon list saved if previous render/opaque (hidden surface)
   was completed so that subsequent draws would be faster
   view3d: added NIL(pType) macro which checks for a null pointer
   >>> need same change in view2d (after testing)
   totalShades is now a global variable (to be decremented if color trouble)
   >>> need same change in view2d (after testing)
   cleaning up: added exitWithAck(info,size,i) macro to send spad 
   acknowledge right before exit of a troubled program. this
   should avoid some of the causes of entering spad break loops
   not enough colors could be allocated; now, only a message is given.
   viewman: adding checks for abnormal exits of child processes (from
   people who use the "Cancel" command from the X server).
   deadBaby() and brokenPipe() in the works.
   view3d: hey! there was a bug in the projections: with perspective on,
   it turns out the Z-axis was rotating opposite of the rest of 
   the system...?...
   fixed perspective
   added box (with back face removal)
   function of 2 variables now has it's own substructure, like tube, and
   shares the (now) general hidden surface subroutine used for the
   tube stuff when the perspective is turned on (when perspective is
   off, a simple back to front routine is sufficient and fast but the
   property that allows that is not preserved in the perspective projection)
   seems like (in tube.c) the overlap list property is not preserved (see
   notes) so now, routine needs to check, for polygon i, polygons
   i+1 through N, always.
   affects ALL: added deltaZ to all the stuff 
   (spad, viewman, viewalone, view3d) - though not used yet
   error messages: if the .Xdefault not found (or .Xdefault wasn't defined) 
   then view2d and view3d will a predefined default set of fonts. it that
   still doesn't work, a (more or less useful) error message is displayed
   and an error signal is sent to Scratchpad to prevent a freeze-up situation.
   viewpack.spad (package VIEW) and view2d.spad (domain GRIMAGE) now check for
   lists that contain illegal empty lists (i.e. point list contains nothing).
   warnings are issued for lists containing both legal point lists and empty
   point lists, errors are issued for lists containing nothing but empty lists.
   made spadcolors30.c into an archived library by the name of libColors.a, 
   source file changed to spadcolors.c; makeColors' arguments have changed 
   and now returns the number of colors allocated - not a pointer to the 
   pixel map
   saymem, check, etc. moved to util.c for library archive
   added a view.h file, with macros to be used by all view programs
   monoColor(x) macro (in view.h) replaces spadColors[x] calls in case 
   display is monochromatic (in global variable mono)
   tube.c: connecting of slices - polygon points changed to outline the 
   rectangular regions without the diagonals (may be prettier when outlines 
   are sketched...slightly, if no split occurs).
   clipping model: both against the hither plane as well as with a 
   clipping volume
   viewport3D.c: made polygon list for functions of two variables so
   that it could call the general hidden surface algorithm (in tube.c) as
   well (turns out that back to front property of 3D explicit equations is
   not preserved when viewed with perspective)
   added volume.c, volume.h for the frustrum (perspective), projected clipping
   and clip volume interface
 
version25: 
  view3d: added long jump to address signals that arrive while in the
          XNextEvent call. spadSignalHandler() now calls spadAction()
          if a signal is received.
  view2d: added query button and messages for each graph image
          (viewport2D.c, control.c, process.c)
  view3d: tube.c: improved speed of drawPolygon by creating overlapped
          list for unmoved polygon, and list for moved polygon that
          may be smaller than the entire list. 
          see "Notes on the Depth Sort Algorithm" for strategy, etc.
          tube.c: moved the resetting of the variables relevant to recalc
          from process.c to tube.c (rotated, switchedPerspective, 
          changedEyeDistance)
  GraphImage now supports 2D primitives like point(), component(), addPoint()
  ViewportDefaultsPackage now exports viewXPos() and stuff; all references
  to integers have been replaced by the more restrictive subdomains 
  (e.g. PositiveInteger, NonNegativeInteger)
  ViewportPackage has dwindled to just drawCurves() and graphCurves()
  view2d, view3d: put in more robust signal handling routines so that
  signals from the viewport manager (Scratchpad) are all processed properly.
  the condition where the user is not allowed to use the control panel of the
  viewport that Scratchpad is sending commands to no longer exists!!!! wow!!!
  simultaneous processing without a race condition occuring (sorta) should
  not occur anymore.
  view3d: modification to keepDrawingViewport() so that signals also causes
  a return of no. this allows Scratchpad input files to be indistinguishable
  from interactive commands from a control panel! (that is, drawViewport()
  no longer need to complete the drawing if it was called from Scratchpad.)
  view2d: spadAction(): now only redraws viewport if the info was received for
  a graph image that is being shown
  view2d: fixed up pick/drop hangup problem. the "dodat" variable in process.c
  needed to be reset earlier, and in each separate routine (pick, drop and 
  query) that required sequential button clicks (e.g. 
  "Drop" + graph number "1").
  view2d: added global variable queriedGraph - so that the last queried graph
  will always be the one displayed.
  view2d.spad: default to points off
  added inverse and monochrome fields in .Xdefaults 
  (e.g. view3d*monochrome : on)
  BUG FIXED: clipping of wire mesh for tubes
  view3d.spad: function of three variables for color specifications ==> changes
  in viewman, viewalone, and view3d to accept additional information.
  structure of fun2VarModel in view3d.h changes *** not backwards 
  compatible with version24.
  BUG FOUND: viewport3D.c still drawing the function of 2 variables
  without perspective (painter's algorithm without processing) wrong!
  BUG FIXED: this time, for shur. flipped quadrants II and IV to remedy bug 
  found in painter's algorithm in viewport3D.c.
  tube.c (view3d): changed routine that redraws quickly from the saved up list
  of processed polygons from the hidden surface algorithm so that each polygon

version 26: 
  view3d: switched over to a generalized subspace points definition.
  so far, wire meshes work for existing types. code in viewport3D.c and tube.c
  are replaced by one more general in component.c; size reduced in half. 
  include: modified=[view3d.h] new=[component.h]

  representation should also handle future 3D things - like space curves, 
  points and stuff without new data structures.
  NEED: take out unused code
  component.spad there temporarily to handle the new representation on the 
  algebra side point.spad deals with the new representation in more 
  generality on the algebra side
  NEED: interface to rest of algebra world
  view2d: draw dashed line if ticks are too close. view2d:

\chapter{Graphics File Formats}
\section{The viewFile data file format}
The viewFile is a control file for graph information. It contains
settings for particular graphs. There are some general window
settings that apply to the whole graph window followed by 9
graph settings, one for each possible graph shown.
\subsection{The viewType}
The viewType (A) is a switch used to decide what tool will be used to
display the graph. At present there are 4 values defined (in the
file [[src/graph/include/action.h]]) which are:
\begin{verbatim}
/* Viewport Types */
#define view3DType     1
#define viewGraphType  2
#define view2DType     3
#define viewTubeType   4
\end{verbatim}
In the example below the integer value is '3', at (A), 
therefore it is of 'view2DType' meaning a 2D graph.

This value is read in [[src/graph/viewalone/viewalone.c]]
\subsection{The title}
The title, at (B), is read in [[src/graph/viewalone/spoon2d.c]].
It can be a maximum of 256 characters.
\subsection{The window boundaries}
There are 4 integers, at (C), the X, Y, Width, and Height
which represent the window size in pixels.
\subsection{The graph specifications}
There are, at (D), a series of specifications for the 9
possible graphs. They are all in groups of 6 lines, one
per graph. These lines are stored in a data structure called
the [[graphArray]] or the [[graphStateArray]]. The lines are:
\begin{list}{}
\item D1 is either an integer value 0 or 1 (\%d format). 
If the value is zero the rest of the information is ignored and 
the graph is not displayed. If the value is 1 then the graph is 
displayed. This information is stored in [[graphArray[i].key]].
\item D2 are 2 C general numbers (\%g format). They represent
the scale factors in X and Y. This information is stored in
[[graphStateArray[i].scaleX]] and [[graphStateArray[i].scaleY]].
\item D3 are 2 C general numbers (\%g format). They represent 
the change in X and Y increments. This information is stored in
[[graphStateArray[i].deltaX]] and [[graphStateArray[i].deltaY]].
\item D4 are 2 C general numbers (\%g format). They represent the
center for the X and Y axes. This information is stored in
[[graphStateArray[i].centerX]] and [[graphStateArray[i].centerY]].
\item D5 are 7 integers (\%d format). They represent:
\begin{list}{}
\item pointsOn - 0 means no points, 1 means plot points.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].pointsOn]].
\item connectOn - 0 means isolated points, 1 means connected points.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].connectOn]].
\item splineOn - 0 means no spline, 1 means spline.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].splineOn]].
\item axesOn - 0 means no axes, 1 means draw axes.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].axesOn]].
\item axesColor - 0 means black and white, 1 means color.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].axesColor]].
\item unitsOn - 0 means no tick marks (units), 1 means units.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].unitsOn]].
\item unitsColor - 0 means black and white, 1 means color.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].unitsColor]].
\end{list}
\item D6 are 2 C integers (\%d format). 
\begin{list}{}
\item showing - 0 means the graph is hidden, 1 means showing.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].showing]].
\item selected - 0 means not selected, 1 means selected.
Stored in [[graphStateArray[i].selected]].
\end{list}
\end{list}

\section{The graph file format}
There are up to 9 files, named [ [[graph0]] .. [[graph8]] ].
There is one file per graph as indicated by the [[data]] file above.
\subsection{The bounding values}
There are 4 integers (\%d format) at (A) giving the xmin, ymin, xmax, and
ymax values for the graph. These are stored in
[[graphArray[i].xmin]], [[graphArray[i].ymin]], [[graphArray[i].xmax]],
and [[graphArray[i].ymax]].

There are 2 general numbers (\%g format) at (B)
giving the xNorm and yNorm values. These are stored in
[[graphArray[i].xNorm]] and [[graphArray[i].yNorm]].

There are 2 general numbers (\%g format) at (C) 
giving the X origin and Y origin values. These are stored in
[[graphArray[i].originX]] and [[graphArray[i].originY]].

There are 2 general numbers (\%g format) at (D)
giving the X units and Y units from Axiom. These are stored in
[[graphArray[i].spadUnitX]] and [[graphArray[i].spadUnitY]].

There are 2 general numbers (\%g format) at (E)
giving the X units and Y units in graph coordinates. These are stored in
[[graphArray[i].unitX]] and [[graphArray[i].unitY]].

There is 1 integer (\%d format) at (F)
giving the number of lists that make up the graph. This is stored in
[[graphArray[i].numberOfLists]]. 

For each list, and in this case there is only 1 list. Each list
is stored in a [[pointListStruct]] pointed to by [[aList]].
In this case we have:
\begin{list}{}
\item (G) is the number of points in the list. This is 1 integer
(\%d format). It is stored in [[aList->numberOfPoints]].
\item (H) is 3 integers (\%d format) which represent the point color,
the line color, and the point size. These are stored in
[[aList->pointColor]], [[aList->lineColor]], and [[aList->pointSize]].
\item (I) is 4 general numbers (\%g format) which represent the
x, y, hue, and shade of a point. These are stored in a structure
called [[aPoint]] which consists of
[[aPoint->x]],[[aPoint->y]],[[aPoint->hue]], and [[aPoint->shade]].
These are pointed to by the [[aList]] structure. There are as many
copies of this data as there are points in the graph (G)
\end{list}

control panel outside of it, it placed the control panel in the bottom

\subsection{main}
The main function performs the following steps
\begin{enumerate}
\item calls XOpenDisplay 
(See \ref{XOpenDisplay} on page~\pageref{XOpenDisplay}), 
using the DISPLAY variable from the environment, to choose the display.
\item uses the DefaultScreen macro 
(See \ref{DefaultScreen} on page~\pageref{DefaultScreen}), to get the
user's default screen.
\item uses the RootWindow macro 
(See \ref{RootWindow} on page~\pageref{RootWindow}), to get the
root window on the user's display and screen.
\item calls XCreateAssocTable to create an association table with
{\tt nbuckets} which is elsewhere defined to be 128. Note that we
do not actually use the X10 definition of this function but use our
own version. See \ref{XCreateAssocTable} on page~\pageref{XCreateAssocTable}.
This table is used to hold an association between the control panel buttons
and the window they control.

totalShades is initially set to totalShadesConst.
If X cannot allocate 8 shades for each hue, totalShades 
is decremented. there is currently only a check for
this value to be positive. --> something to add: change over 
to monochrome if totalShades=0. just modify the spadcolors.c
file. spadcolors.c has been modified so that it returns the
value for totalShades. since the return value had previously
been unused, a modification in this way ensures continued
support of other routines calling this function (e.g. hypertex stuff).

\subsection{makeTriangle}
Given three indices to three points, a triangular polygon is created 
and inserted into the polygon list of viewData. If two or more of the 
points are coincidental, no polygon is created since that would be a 
degenerate (collapsed) polygon.

\subsection{triangulate}
Only if there is more than one list do we triangulate; a single list 
is used for either a space curve or simply a point.  Actually, in that 
case, we now make "flat" *polygons, flagged by the primitiveType field 
(pointComponent, etc. in tube.h).  We need to examine two lists at a time
(and if the structure is closed, the last and first as well). For every 
three points in the two lists, alternating between one in one and two in
the other, we construct triangles. If one list is shorter, then its last 
point becomes the vertex for the remaining pairs of points from the other
list.  It turns out that any distribution of points in the two lists 
(preserving cyclic order) will produce the same desired polygon.

\subsection{make3DComponents}
Read in all the 3D data from the viewport manager and construct the 
model of it. The model is based upon a list of lists of lists of points. 
Each top level list makes a component in 3-space. The interpretation 
really begins at the level below that, where the list of lists of 
points is. For 3D explicit equations of two variables, the closed 
boolean for this level is False and the closed boolean for each sublist 
is False as well. For 3D parameterized curves of one variable, the 
closed boolean for this level is defined by the user from Axiom , 
(which defaults to False) and the closed boolean for each sublist is True.

This is where we interpret the list of lists of lists of points struct.
We want to extract the following forms of data:
\begin{itemize}
\item individual points (drawn as filled points)
\item lines (space curves)
\item defined polygon primitives
\item surfaces
\end{itemize}
the last one is the one that will replace the function of 2 variables,
tubes as well as 3D parameterized functions of 2 variables.
Since there could be many other ways of constructing 
{\tt List List List Points} - much
more than could be usefully interpreted - any other formats are
currently not allowed. When they are, this comment should be updated
appropriately.
      
Traverse each component.
We decide here, before we begin traversing the
component what we want to interpret it as.
Here's the convention used to figure that out:
\begin{itemize}
\item points: \#anLLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfLists was 1\\
\#anLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfPoints is 1
\item lines: \#anLLPoint$\rightarrow$ numOfLists was 1\\
\#anLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfPoints > 1
\item polygons: \#anLLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfLists was 2\\
\#anLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfPoints is 1
\item surface: \#anLLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfLists was some $m>1$\\
\#anLPoint$\rightarrow$numOfPoints all point lists are the same.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{putControlPanelSomewhere}
This routine puts up the control panel associated with the viewport passed
in. It first tries to put it to the right of the viewport.  If there isn't
enough room, it tries the bottom and so on going clockwise. If the viewport
is too big and there is no room to put the control panel outside of it, the
control panel is placed on the bottom right hand corner of the viewport.

This file depends on the file msort.h. There, a data type called linkElement 
is defined. It is used here and is the main structure being sorted here. 
You can sort any linked structure, under any name - so long as it has a 
next field (see below). The define statement, below, renames linkElement 
to linkThing. All you need to do is change the define statement to rename
your structure to linkThing. The first argument you pass to the sort routine 
is a pointer to the unsorted list. The function returns with that same 
pointer pointing to a sorted list. 
\begin{verbatim}
  Usage:                                           
    linkElement *msort(p,min,max,compare)          
      linkElement *L;                              
      int min,max;                                 
      int (*compare)();                            
                                                   
    e.g.                                           
      msort(L,0,N,compare);                        
                                                   
    where                                          
      L is the list of things to be sorted,        
        it is expected to be a linked list         
        where the following element is pointed     
        to by a field called "next"                
      0 is the index of the first element          
        (since this routine is called recursively, 
        this field is kept for clarity; it will    
        always be zero at top level)               
      N the number of elements in the list         *
        minus one                                  
      compare(X,Y) is a comparison function that   
        returns a -1 if X is less than Y           
                   0 if X is the same as Y         
               and 1 if X is greater than Y

\chapter{gdraws}
\label{gdraws}

This section contains a set of functions for handling 
postscript generation. This is handled by defining a set of cover
functions for the X routines, as in GDrawArc versus XDrawArc.
When the Xoption is set the X routine is called. When the PSoption 
is set the postscript routines are generated.

This directory consists of all the Gdraw functions.
The subdirectory PS contains all the ps drawing functions in support of
the Gdraw functions.

\subsection{Gdraw}

A Gdraw function, using a draw option dFlsg as input, provides drawings
capability on different output devices.  Currently, Gdraw supports routines
both in Xwindows functions, and in postscript functions on
a postscript printer/interpreter.

The general drawing functions are (see file for description of functionality)
\begin{verbatim}
 1.  Gdrawarc.c
 2.  Gdrawstring.c
 3.  Gdraw.c
 4.  Gdrawline.c
 5.  Gdrfilled.c
 6.  GdrawFrame.c
 7.  Gdrawlines.c
 8.  Gfillarc.c
 9.  GdrawIstr.c
 10. Gdrawrect.c
 11. Gmisc.c
 12. GinitPS.c
 13. GCreatePS.c
 14. PSFill.c
 15. ../include/g.h
    header information needed by all the Gdraw routines and
    view3d/view2d as well.
 16. ps.h
    header information needed by only the Gdraw routines.

\subsection{POSTSCRIPT}

A PostScript file can be generated by using a button on the control
panel of a viewalone picture, or in Axiom, with the command write,
option Postscript.  This file can be submitted to the postsctipt
printer to be printed, or viewed using the postscript interpreter.  
It will draw a window, title, and picture clipped to fit inside of the
window.

In order to generate a postscript output, we first initializ file names and
paths to be used by our program by using
\begin{verbatim}
	InitPs(viewWindow, titleWindow)    [in GinitPS.c]
\end{verbatim}
then call the G draw routines with option "PS", which would generate postscript
drawing commands.  Then create the output file (OUTPUT.ps by default) by using
\begin{verbatim}
	makePSfile(viewWindow, titleWindow, title)   [in GcreatePS.c]
\end{verbatim}

The output file would be in local directory, i.e., the directory where Axiom
or viewalone, etc., was started up.

The following routines are used to test out the Gdraw functions:
\begin{verbatim}
1.  main.c      creates windows, and titles and processes Xwindow events.
2.  data.c      creates data for drawing and call Gdraw routines.
3.  menu.c      draws menu when mouse clicks in viewWindow
4.  yesorno.c   determines if mouse click in menu means "yes" or "no".
5.  loadfont.c 	loads font for display
\end{verbatim}

The Gdraw routines have been written in such a way that they are usable by
both view3d and view2d.  

\subsection{To use G Functions}

In order to draw in postscript, use GSetForeground to set the foreground 
colors for the drawing (and fill) functions.  Use GSetLineAttributes
to set line attributes.  And finally, replace the XDraw commands with the
corresponding GDraw commands with the appropriate parameters.  In addition,
we need to: draw frame, set GC variable names, create GCs, initialize
postscript data structures, cat all the procedures used together.

{\bf IMPORTANT}:\\
In order to create postscript command file, we need environment
variable DEVE (i.e., setenv DEVE /u/jimwen/3D/version28) or AXIOM (e.g., setenv
AXIOM /spad/mnt/rt in case gdraws directory has been installed on the server).
Without this path, the program would not know where the postscript files (in
gdraws/PS) are.

{\bf LIMITATIONS} of current implementation:\\
A picture is printed with 1 inch x direction, and 1 inch y direction 
offset, and the largest complete picutre is the size of the page
with the offest.

{\bf BUGS}:\\
The region box is not drawn correctly when perspective is altered.


{\bf FUTURE DIRECTIONS}:
\begin{itemize}
\item for view3d color rendering, may want to convert LINE drawing color
to the appropriate grayscale.  Right now, they're all drawn in black.
\item for view3d's routines for color rendering, may want to implement
color drawing for postscript functions just in case someone does
have access to a color postscript printer.
\item implement more functionality for attributes used in GC, i.e., dashed
line, dotted line etc.
\item implement a display postscript menu to set things like picture size,
landscape/portrait orientation, picture centered, left, right, up,
down, etc., reversed video.
\item make font an attribute in postscripts's graphics context so the
font can be set in user program.  Right now, it uses only 1 font.
\item for view2d's stuff, implement a smaller font for the drawing the 
units on the axes.
\end{itemize}

\section{gfun.c}
Indices for PostScript draw procedures.

The order of these defined variables are very important; they are used
to create the OUTPUT file.  Essentially, PSCreateFile() loops through the
index of 0 to psDrawNo and checks if the file/procedure is used.  If so,
the file is copied to the output file.
\index{gfun.c}
<<gfun.c>>=

\subsection{XDrawString}
\label{XDrawString}
\index{X11!XDrawString}
XDrawString draws an 8-bit text string, foreground only. 
\begin{verbatim}
XDrawString (Display *display, Drawable drawable, GC gc, 
             int x, int y, char *string, int length);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} --
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt drawable} -- Specifies the drawable. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt x} --
Specify the x coordinate of the baseline starting position for
the character, relative to the origin of the specified drawable.
\item {\tt y} --
Specify the y coordinate of the baseline starting position for
the character, relative to the origin of the specified drawable.
\item {\tt string} -- Specifies the character string. 
\item {\tt length} -- 
Specifies the number of characters in the string argument. 
\end{itemize}

XDrawString draws the given string into a drawable using the
foreground only to draw set bits in the font. It does not affect any
other pixels in the bounding box for each character.  The y coordinate
defines the baseline row of pixels while the x coordinate is the point
for measuring the ibearing, rbearing, and width from.  

XDrawString uses these graphics context component: function,
plane\_mask, fill\_style, font, subwindow\_mode, clip x origin,
clip\_y\_origin, and clip\_mask. This function also uses these graphics
context mode-dcpendent components: foreground, tile, stipple, ts x
origin, and ts\_y\_origin. Each character image, as defined by the font
in gc, is treated as an additional mask for a fill operation on the
drawable.

\subsection{XDrawPoint}
\label{XDrawPoint}
\index{X11!XDrawPoint}
From the Xlib Drawing Primitives, XDrawPoint draws a point.
\begin{verbatim}
XDrawPoint (Display *display, Drawable drawable, GC gc, int x, int y);
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} --
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt drawable} -- Specifies the drawable. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt x} --
Specify the x coordinate of the point, relative to the corner of the 
drawable. 
\item {\tt y} --
Specify the y coordinate of the point, relative to the corner of the 
drawable. 
\end{itemize}

XDrawPoint uses the foreground pixel and function components of the
graphics con- text to draw a single point into the specified
drawable. XDrawPoint uses these graphics context components: function,
plane\_mask, foreground, subwindow\_mode, clip x origin, clip\_y\_origin,
and clip\_mask. 

\subsection{XDrawLine}
\label{XDrawLine}
\index{X11!XDrawLine}
From the Xlib Drawing Primitives, XDrawLine draws a line between two points. 
\begin{verbatim}
XDrawLine(Display *display, Drawable drawable, GCgc, 
          int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2);
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} --
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt drawable} -- Specifies the drawable. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt x1} --
Specify the x coordinate of the start point of the line relative to
the drawable origin. 
\item {\tt y1} --
Specify the y coordinate of the start point of the line relative to
the drawable origin. 
\item {\tt x2} --
Specify the x coordinate of the end point of the line relative to
the drawable origin. 
\item {\tt y2} --
Specify the y coordinate of the end point of the line relative to
the drawable origin. 
\end{itemize}

XDrawLine connects point (xl, yl) to point (x2, y2).  XDrawLine uses
the components of the specified graphics context to draw a line
between two points in the specified drawable. No pixel is drawn more
than once.

XDrawLine uses these graphics context components: function,
plane\_mask, line\_width, line\_style, cap\_style, fill\_style,
subwindow\_mode, clip\_ x\_origin, clip\_y\_origin, and
clip\_mask. XDrawLine also uses these graphics context mode-dependent
components: foreground, background, tile, stipple, ts\_x\_origin,
ts\_y\_origin, dash\_offset, and dash\_list.  XDrawLine is not
affected by tile or stipple in the GC.

\subsection{XDrawImageString}
\label{XDrawImageString}
\index{X11!XDrawImageString}
XDrawlmageString draws image text characters. 
\begin{verbatim}
XDrawImageString(Display *display, Drawable drawable, GC gc, int x, int y,
                 char *string, int length);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} --
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt drawable} -- Specifies the drawable. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt x} --
Specify the x coordinate of the baseline starting position for the
image text character, relative to the origin of the specified
drawable.
\item {\tt y} --
Specify the y coordinate of the baseline starting position for the
image text character, relative to the origin of the specified
drawable.
\item {\tt string} -- Specifies the character string
\item {\tt length} -- Specifies the number of characters in the string
\end{itemize}

XDrawImageString uses these graphics context components: plane\_mask,
foreground, background, font, subwindow\_mode, clip x origin,
clip\_y\_origin, and clip\_mask. The function and fill\_style defined
in gc are ignored; the effective function is GXcopy and the effective
fill\_style is FillSolid.  XDrawImageString first fills a destination
rectangle with the background pixel defined in gc, and then prints the
text with the foreground pixel. The upper-left corner of the filled
rectngle is at Ix, y - font\_ascent], the width is overall-width and
the height is ascent + descent.  The overall-width, ascent, and
descent are as would be returned by XQuery-TextExtents using gc and
string.


\subsection{XFillArc}
\label{XFillArc}
\index{X11!XFillArc}
From the Xlib Drawing Primitives, XFillArc fills an arc. 
\begin{verbatim}
XFillArc (Display *display, Drawable drawable, GC gc, 
          int x, int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height,
          int angle1, int angle2);
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} --
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt drawable} -- Specifies the drawable. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt x} --
Specify the x coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box 
containing the arc, relative to the origin of the drawable. 
\item {\tt y} --
Specify the y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box 
containing the arc, relative to the origin of the drawable. 
\item {\tt width} --
Specify the width in pixels. These are the major and minor axes of the arc. 
\item {\tt height} --
Specify the height in pixels. These are the major and minor axes of the arc. 
\item {\tt angle1} --
Specifies the start of the arc relative to the three-o'clock position
from the center. Angles are specified in degrees, multiplied by 64.
\item {\tt angle2} --
Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative to the start of the
arc. Angles are specified in degrees, multiplied by 64.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Description}

XFillArc fills an arc according to the arc mode in the GC. The x, y,
width, and height arguments specify the bounding box for the arc. See
XDrawArc for the description of how this bounding box is used to
compute the arc. Some, but not all, of the pixels drawn with XDrawArc
will be drawn by XFilIArc with the same arguments.  The arc forms one
boundary of the area to be filled. The other boundary is determined by
the arc\_mode in the GC. If the arc\_mode in the GC is ArcChord, the
single line segment joining the endpoints of the arc is used. If
ArcPieSlice, the two line segments joining the endpoints of the arc
with the center point are used.

XFilIArc uses these graphics context components: function, plane\_mask,
fill\_style, arc\_mode, subwindow\_mode, clip x origin, clip\_y\_origin,
and clip\_mask. This function also uses these graphics context
mode-dependent components: foreground, background, tile, stipple, ts
x origin, and ts\_y\_ origin.

\subsection{XDrawArc}
\label{XDrawArc}
\index{X11!XDrawArc}
From the Xlib Drawing Primitives, XDrawArc draws an arc fitting inside
a rectangle.

\begin{verbatim}
XDrawArc(Display *display, Drawable drawable, GC gc, int x, int y, 
         unsigned int width, unsigned int height, int angle1, int angle2);
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} --
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt drawable} -- Specifies the drawable. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt x} --
Specify the x coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle that 
contains the arc, relative to the origin of the specified drawable. 
\item {\tt y} --
Specify the y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the rectangle that 
contains the arc, relative to the origin of the specified drawable. 
\item {\tt width} --
Specify the width in pixels of the major and minor axes of the arc. 
\item {\tt height} --
Specify the height in pixels of the major and minor axes of the arc. 
\item {\tt angle1} --
Specifies the start of the arc relative to the three-o'clock position
from the center. Angles are specified in 64ths of a degree, (360 * 64
is a complete circle).
\item {\tt int angle2} --
Specifies the path and extent of the arc relative to the start of the
arc.  Angles are specified in 64ths of a degree, (360 * 64 is a
complete circle).
\end{itemize}

XDrawArc draws a circular or elliptical arc. An arc is specified by a
rectangle and two angles. The x and y coordinates are relative to the
origin of the drawable, and define the upper-left corner of the
rectangle. The center of the circle or ellipse is the center of the
rectan- gle, and the major and minor axes are specified by the width
and height, respectively.  The angles are signed integers in 64ths of
a degree, with positive values indicating counter-clockwise motion
and negative values indicating clockwise motion, truncated to a
maximum of 360 degrees. The start of the arc is specified by anglel
relative to the three-o'clock position from the center, and the path
and extent of the arc is specified by angle2 relative to the start of
the arc.

By specifying one axis to be 0, a horizontal or vertical line can be
drawn.  Angles are computed based solely on the coordinate system and
ignore the aspect ratio. In other words, if the bounding rectangle of
the arc is not square and anglel is 0 and angle2 is (45x64), a point
drawn from the center of the bounding box through the endpoint of the
arc will not pass through the comer of the rectangle.

XDrawArc uses these graphics context components: function, plane\_mask, 
line\_width, line\_style, cap\_style, join\_style, fill\_style,
subwindow\_ mode, clip x origin, clip\_y\_origin, and clip\_mask. This
function also uses these graphics context mode-dependent components:
foreground, background, tile, stipple, ts x origin, ts\_y\_origin,
dash\_offset, and dash\_list. XDrawArc is not affected by the tile or
stipple in the GC.

\subsection{XSetForeground}

\index{X11!XSetForeground}
In Xlib, in the Graphics Context,
XSetForeground m set the foreground pixel value in a graphics context. 
\begin{verbatim}
XSetForeground (Display *display, GC gc, unsigned long foreground);
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} -- 
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt foreground} --
Specifies the foreground you want to set for the specified graphics context. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XSetBackground}
\label{XSetBackground}
\index{X11!XSetBackground}
In Xlib, in the Graphics Context,
XSetBackground m set the background pixel value in a graphics context. 
\begin{verbatim}
XSetBackground (Display *display, GC gc, unsigned long background);
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt display} -- 
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay. 
\item {\tt gc} -- Specifies the graphics context. 
\item {\tt background} --
Specifies the background you want to set for the specified graphics context. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{XSetLineAttributes}
\label{XSetLineAttributes}
\index{X11!XSetLineAttributes}
In Xlib, in the Graphics Context, the function XSetLineAttributes 
sets four types of line characteristics in the GC: line\_width, 
line\_style, cap\_style, and join\_style. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt line\_width} -- Specifies the line width you want to set
for the specified graphics context.  A line\_width of zero (0) means
to use the fastest algorithm for drawing a line of one pixel
width. These lines may not meet properly with lines specified as width
1 or more.
\item {\tt line\_style} -- 
Specifies the line style you want to set for the specified graphics context. 
Possible values are LineSolid, LineOnOffDash, or LineDouble-Dash. 
\item {\tt cap\_style} --
Specifies the line and cap style you want to set for the specified graphics 
context. Possible values are CapNotLast, CapButt, CapRound, or 
CapProjecting. 
\item {\tt join\_style} --
Specifies the line-join style you want to set for the specified graphics con- 
text. Possible values are JoinMiter, JoinRound, or JoinBevel. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DefaultScreen}
\label{DefaultScreen}
\index{X11!DefaultScreen}
The DefaultScreen macro returns the default screen number referenced in
the XOpenDisplay routine.

\subsection{RootWindow}
\label{RootWindow}
\index{X11!RootWindow}
 The RootWindow macro returns the root window.

\subsection{XCreateAssocTable}
\index{X11!XCreateAssocTable}
Create a new association table (X10). Note that we have our own version
of this function. 
\begin{verbatim}
  XAssocTable *XCreateAssocTable(int size) 
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt size} 
Specifies the number of buckets in the hashed association table. 
\end{itemize}
{\bf Description}
XCreateAssocTable creates an association table, which allows you to
associate your own structures with X resources in a fast lookup
table. This function is provided for compatibility with X Version
10. To use it you must include the file <xll> and link with the
library -loldX.  The size argument specifies the number of buckets in
the hash system of XAssocTable.  For reasons of efficiency the number
of buckets should be a power of two. Some size sugges- tions might be:
use 32 buckets per 100 objects; a reasonable maximum number of object
per buckets is 8.  If there is an error allocating memory for the
XAssocTable, a NULL pointer is returned.

{\bf Structures}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct { 
    XAssoc *buckets; /* pointer to first bucket in array */ 
    int size;        /* table size (number of buckets) */ 
  } XAssocTable; 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{XOpenDisplay}
\label{XOpenDisplay}
\index{X11!XOpenDisplay}
To open a connection to the X server that controls a display, 
use XOpenDisplay().
\begin{verbatim}
    Display *XOpenDisplay(char *displayname);
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt displayname} Specifies the hardware display name, which
determines the display and communications domain to be used. On a
POSIX-conformant system, if the displayname is NULL, it defaults to
the value of the DISPLAY environment variable.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Description}

The encoding and interpretation of the display name is implementation
dependent. Strings in the Host Portable Character Encoding are
supported; support for other characters is implementation
dependent. On POSIX-conformant systems, the display name or DISPLAY
environment variable can be a string in the format:
\begin{verbatim}
    hostname:number.screennumber
\end{verbatim}

{\tt hostname} Specifies the name of the host machine on which the display
is physically attached. You follow the hostname with either a single
colon (:) or a double colon (::).

{\tt number} Specifies the number of the display server on that host
machine. You may optionally follow this display number with a period
(.). A single CPU can have more than one display. Multiple displays
are usually numbered starting with zero.

{\tt screennumber} Specifies the screen to be used on that server. Multiple
screens can be controlled by a single X server. The screennumber sets
an internal variable that can be accessed by using the DefaultScreen()
macro or the XDefaultScreen() function if you are using languages
other than C.

For example, the following would specify screen 1 of display 0 on the
machine named ``dual-headed'':
\begin{verbatim}
    dual-headed:0.1 
\end{verbatim}
The XOpenDisplay() function returns a Display structure that serves as
the connection to the X server and that contains all the information
about that X server. XOpenDisplay() connects your application to the X
server through TCP or DECnet communications protocols, or through some
local inter-process communication protocol. If the hostname is a host
machine name and a single colon (:) separates the hostname and display
number, XOpenDisplay() connects using TCP streams. If the hostname is
not specified, Xlib uses whatever it believes is the fastest
transport. If the hostname is a host machine name and a double colon
(::) separates the hostname and display number, XOpenDisplay()
connects using DECnet. A single X server can support any or all of
these transport mechanisms simultaneously. A particular Xlib
implementation can support many more of these transport mechanisms.

If successful, XOpenDisplay() returns a pointer to a Display
structure, which is defined in X11/Xlib.h. If XOpenDisplay() does not
succeed, it returns NULL. After a successful call to XOpenDisplay()
all of the screens in the display can be used by the client. The
screen number specified in the displayname argument is returned by
the DefaultScreen() macro (or the XDefaultScreen() function). You can
access elements of the Display and Screen structures only by using the
information macros or functions.
