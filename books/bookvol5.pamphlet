\chapter{Type Inference and Coercion}
\section{Introduction}

The Axiom system is centered on a strongly typed abstract datatype
programming language with multiple inheritance. The compiler for this
language produces a library of packages of polynomorpic functions and
parameterized abstract datatypes. The system interpreter provides an
interface to the compiler and library and supports a subset of the
Axiom language. The design of the interpreter includes extensive
datatype inferences and coercion facilities to ease the burden of
working with a strongly typed language and a library containing over
1100 Categories, Domains, and Packages.

The Axiom interpreter is unusual because 
\begin{itemize}
\item Axiom has an infinite number of datatypes and packages
\item each generic operation generally has an infinite number of
interpretations
\item datatypes and packages are instantiated dynamically in response
to user input, and
\item operation interpretation is done by pattern matching on modemaps.
\end{itemize}

The design philosophy is that the interpreter language equals the
compiler language minus the constraints. 

This means that declarations are largely optional and that automatic
datatype conversions may take place when they are deemed appropriate.

In Axiom we use the term {\sl conversion} to mean the transformation
an object of one datatype into an object of another datatype. A special
kind of conversion is {\sl coercion}, where we further require that
transformation is reasonable (usually in an algebraic or 
non-information-losing sense). Examples of coercions involve changing
integers into rational numbers, rational numbers into (constant)
polynomials with rational number coefficients, lists of lists into
two dimensional arrays, etc.

Conversion is done through two operations, {\bf coerce} and {\bf
convert} which are otherwise ordinary operations exported by the
abstract datatypes of the system. The interpreter is allowed to
perform conversions named {\bf coerce} whenever it determines they are
necessary. Most coercions are reversible and their application does
not lose information. An example of a conversion that is not a
coercion is the transformation of a rational number into a floating
point number. Having an automatic conversion from an exact to an
inexact object is not acceptable.

All atomic expressions (as produced by the parser) have default
datatypes. These are {\bf Boolean}, {\bf Float}, {\bf Integer}, 
{\bf String}, {\bf Symbol}, and {\bf List(None)} (for an empty list). If
these are assigned in declared variables or used as arguments to
functions, coercions are often performed to create objects of other
datatypes.

Coercion is combined with the {\sl type resolve facility} to
determine the result datatype of an expression presented to the
interpreter. Datatypes {\bf T1} and {\bf T2} {\sl resolve} to a
datatype {\bf T3} if all objects belonging to {\bf T1} and {\bf T2}
can be coerced to {\bf T3}. In Axiom, the resolve facility is driven
by a rule system, by information about coercions, and by the structure
of the datatypes involved.

\section{Overview of the Abstract Datatype System}

It is not within the scope of this chapter to fully discuss the Axiom
abstract datatype system. This section is an overview of those terms
and concepts needed to describe the implemention of the interpreter. 
Other sources are available that contain more detailed discussions. 
\cite{Jenk81}\cite{Lisk79}\cite{Fort85}\cite{Swee86}
\cite{Jenk86}\cite{Watt87}

The Axiom library consists of compiled code that creates
``categories'', ``domains'', and ``packages''. A {\sl domain} is a
datatype, a {\sl package} is a collection of functions, and a 
{\sl category} is a collection of operation signatures and attributes, as
shown below. These are created by special functions called 
{\sl constructors}, which are generally parameterized.

Domains and packages implement the functions in categories. Categories
serve to separate the contract from the implementation. However,
default implementations can be given in categories by assuming the
existence of other implemented operations. For example, a default
implementation of binary ``-" can be given by using unary ``-'' and
binary ``+"".

\subsection{Categories}

A domain is an instance of an abstract datatype specified by one or
more categories. Categories serve to group together domains with
common properties (e.g. operations). A basic category in Axiom is {\bf
Set} which has the definition:
\begin{verbatim}
   Set(): Category == with
     "=" : ($,$) -> Boolean
     coerce : $  -> Expression
\end{verbatim}

The syntax means the following. {\bf Set} is a category constructor
having no parameters. Lines 2 and 3 of the definition present {\sl
signatures} for the two operations that are exported by {\bf Set}:
an operation ``$=$'' that takes 2 elements of the set and returns a
{\bf Boolean}, and an operation {\bf coerce} that takes an element 
of the set and returns a printable representation of it. The symbol
``\$'' refers to the set itself. All domains which belong to {\bf Set}
contain ``$=$'' and {\bf coerce} among their operations (though it is
possible that they are not implemented).

Categories may be extended. A semigroup is a set that has an
associative multiplication operation. Given such a mulitplication, it
is easy to define an exponentiation by positive integers 
($x**1=x$, $x**2=x*x$, $x**3=x*x**2$,\ldots). The definition of the
{\bf SemiGroup} constructor in Axiom is
\begin{verbatim}
   SemiGroup(): Category == Set with
     "*" : ($,$) -> $
     "**" : ($, PositiveInteger) => $
     associate("*")
\end{verbatim}

The last line of this definition presents an {\sl attribute} declaring
that multiplication is associative. Attributes declare properties of
the operations or the datatype.

As an example, {\bf Integer} belongs to {\sl SemiGroup} which means 
that it should have everything from {\bf Set} plus the listed
mutiplication and exponentiation operators. Multiplication is 
asserted to be associative and so this may be assumed for {\bf Integer}.
If a category {\bf C2} extends a category {\bf C1}, any domain that
belongs to {\bf C2} also belongs to {\bf C1}.

Categories may be parameterized.
\begin{verbatim}
   ListCategory(S: Set): Category == Set with
     first : $ -> $
     rest :  $ -> $
     null :  $ -> Boolean
     . . .
\end{verbatim}
presumably describes the operations and attributes that any abstract
datatype that purports to act like a linked list should have. The
parameter {\bf S} can be any domain that belongs to {\bf Set}. If
we defined a special version of this
\begin{verbatim}
   SemiGroupListCategory(S: SemiGroup): Category == Set
     with
       first : $ -> $
       rest :  $ -> $
       null :  $ -> Boolean
       . . .
\end{verbatim}
then {\bf S} must have been explicitly declared to belong to 
{\bf SemiGroup}. Category membership is by name: a domain having the
operations and attributes of {\bf SemiGroup} does not belong to this
category unless it has been explicitly declared to belong to 
{\bf SemiGroup} or one of its extensions.

Categories allow multiple inheritance.
\begin{verbatim}
   FiniteList(S: Set): Category ==
     Join(Finite, ListCategory(S))
\end{verbatim}
defines a category constructor that contains all operation signatures
and attributes from both the categories {\bf Finite} and
{\bf ListCategory(S)}.

\subsection{Domains}

Domains are created by domain constructors and are objects. They
provide a representation for an instance of an abstract datatype,
implement the operations of the categories to which they belong, and
presumably satisfy the attributes of the categories. The
representation of a domain does not depend at all on the categories to
which the domain belongs.

In the implementation of {\bf Integer}, the following category definition
is given and specifies the behavior of the domain:
\begin{verbatim}
   Integer(): Join(UniqueFactorizationDomain,
     EuclideanDomain, OrderedRing, DifferentialRing)
       with
         oddp : $ -> Boolean
         random : () -> $
         numberOfDigits : ($,$) -> $
         abs : $ -> $
         canonicalUnitNormal
\end{verbatim}

The category of {\bf Integer} is not one named category but, instead,
is composed of several pieces. The full category is that obtained by
joining 4 named categories, 4 additional operations, and 1 additional
attribute. Note, though, that {\bf Integer} belongs to each of the 4
named categories, {\sl plus} their ancestors. In particular, 
{\bf Integer} is a {\bf SemiGroup} because it is a {\bf DifferentialRing},
which is a {\bf Ring}, which is a {\bf SemiGroup}. In fact, the 
{\bf Join} creates several paths back to the category {\bf SemiGroup}. 
{\bf Integer} may be used anywhere a {\bf SemiGroup} is required.

Domains may provide functions for objects other than those which they
create. For example, {\bf RationalNumber} implements a ``$/$'' for
two {\bf Integer} arguments.

Two domain constructors that are particularly useful in representing
other domains are {\bf Record} and {\bf Union}. A record is similar to
structures of the same name in many other languages: it has one or
more fields accessed via selector names. The objects in the fields can
be of any datatype. The construtor {\bf Union} creates 
{\sl discriminated} unions: an object of {\bf Union(Integer,String)}
belongs either to the {\bf Integer} branch or the {\bf String} branch
of the union. The {\bf case} function is used to test for membership
in branches.

The constructor {\bf Mapping} creates the datatypes of functions.
Declaring {\bf oddp : Mapping(Boolean,Integer)} states that {\bf oddp}
is a function taking one integer argument and returning a boolean.
A convenient alternative notation for this is 
{\bf oddp:~Integer~$\rightarrow$~Boolean}. Functions are first-class
objects and can be passed to other functions.

The Axiom language design completely separates the concrete 
implementation inheritance from the abstract specification inheritance.
Domains can inherit implementations from their representations, but
the external view of them is only determined by the categories to
which they belong. The idea of {\sl subtype} in languages such
Trellis/Owl\footnote{Trellis is a trademark of Digital Equipment
Corporation} \cite{Scha86} is replaced in Axiom by the two notions of category
and domain.

In addition to providing an organizational hierarchy, categories allow
Axiom to have extra information about domains. Thus, for example, the
compiler knows where operations will be located in domains and can
compile efficient function calls. This information is part of a
structure associated with each operation called a {\sl modemap}.

\subsection{Packages}

A package is a special kind of domain in that it provides no new
objects to the system (other than the package itself). It consists of
a category listing operations and attributes and implementations of
the operations. Because they may be parameterized, packages can be
used to implement algorithms at their most natural level of
abstraction. For example, a repeating-squaring algorithm may be
contained in a package that is parameterized by a domain that is a
{\bf SemiGroup}.

Packages provide an excellent vehicle to implement both
domain-specific and category-general algorithms. They can be used to
implement algorithms that are not included in other domains for
reasons of convenience or necessity. For example, the repeated squaring
algorithm and the integration algorithms are implemented in
packages. They also require extra work by the interpreter because
argument datatypes give no simple clue to the possible location of a
package function. For example, in the expression $2+9$ the operation
``$+$'' is found in the domain {\bf Integer}, which is the common
datatype of the two arguments. However, the function {\bf solve} in
{\tt solve(x**3-1,x)} is not present in either the domain 
{\bf Polynomial(Integer)} of the first argument or the domain {\bf Symbol}
of the second. This, along with the last example of the previous
section, demonstrates the need for a systematic search mechanism of
the Axiom library.

\subsection{Modemaps}

A {\sl modemap} is a syntactic specification of an operation. It gives
the name of the operation, source and target datatypes for its
parameters, and the name of the datatype or package exporting the
operation. For example, the modemap
\begin{verbatim}
   oddp : Integer -> Boolean from Integer
\end{verbatim}
specifies an operation from type {\sl Integer} which takes an integer
argument and returns a boolean value. The ``from''-clause indicates
the {\sl domain of implementation} of the operation (in this case,
{\bf Integer}).

When the datatype or package is parameterized, the conditions on their
parameters appear in an ``if''-clause for the modemap. For example,
every domain created by domain constructor {\bf Matrix} exports a
trace operation:
\begin{verbatim}
   trace: Matrix(R) -> $ if R has Ring from Matrix(R)
\end{verbatim}

The domain constructor {\bf Matrix} takes one parameter {\bf R}
which is required to belong to the category {\bf Ring}.

Operations may also be conditionally exported by a domain constructor.
For example, domains created by {\bf Matrix} export a {\sl {\bf determinant}}
operation only if the homogeneous multiplication ``*'' in the underlying
domain is commutative, that is, {\bf R} has {\sl {\bf commutative("*")}}.
The modemap for {\sl {\bf determinant}} is
\begin{verbatim}
   determinant: Matrix(R) -> $ if R has Ring
     and R has commutative("*") from Matrix(R)
\end{verbatim}

Similarly, datatypes creaated by {\bf Matrix} export an {\sl {\bf inverse}}
operation only if their argument domain belongs to {\bf Field}. Since
the requirement ``{\bf R} has {\bf Field}'' implies
``{\bf R} has {\bf Ring}'' the modemap for {\sl {\bf inverse}} is
\begin{verbatim}
   inverse: Matrix(R) -> Union(R,"failed")
      if R has Field from Matrix(R)
\end{verbatim}

The collection of modemaps from all abstract datatypes and packages
constitutes the {\sl global modemap database} for Axiom. To standardize
the presentation of modemaps, arguments and other parameters are 
prefaced by ``pattern variables'', here called {\bf *1}, {\bf *2}, etc.
The resulting form of the modemap for {\bf Matrix} {\sl {\bf inverse}}
in the modemap database is, for example,
\begin{verbatim}
   inverse: *1 -> Union(*1,"failed")
      if *1 is Matrix(*2) and *2 has Field from *1
\end{verbatim}

In addition to this general modemap database, each domain or package has
a {\sl local modemap database} for all its exported operations. Note
that the pattern variables and ``if''-clauses of the above global
modemaps depend on the parameters to a domain or package constructor.
For a domain or package itself, all parameters to the constructor are
known. Thus local modemaps have no patterns. Predicates reduce to
{\sl true} or {\sl false}. All modemaps in a local modemap database 
for a domain or package {\bf D} therefore have the general form
\begin{verbatim}
   f: S -> T if true from D
\end{verbatim}

Those having a predicate of {\tt false} simply do not exist for a
given domain or package. For example, {\bf Matrix(RationalNumber)}
will have an {\sl {\bf inverse}} operation whereas {\bf Matrix(Integer)}
will not, since {\bf RationalNumber} is a field but {\bf Integer} is not.

\subsection{Interpretation}

The role of the interpreter is to evaluate input expressions entered
by the user. In addition to computations, these expressions may be
declarations, function definitions, or system commands. A value in Axiom
is described by a pair $<a$,A$>$ where $a$ is an object and A is its type.

Evaluation of an operator-operand expression $f(x,y,\ldots)$,
with $n$ $(n > 1)$ arguments $x,y,\ldots$, is done in a bottom-up
manner. The interpreter will evaluate the arguments to produce a 
corresponding $n$-tuple of argument values $<a$,A$>$, $<b$,B$>$,
$\ldots$. At this point an attempt will be made to select an
applicable modemap for $f$. If this modemap has a return type of {\bf T},
$f$ is applied to the (possibly coerced) arguments to yield a result $t$
and subsequent value pair $<t$,T$>$.

\subsection{Modemap Selection}

Given a function call $f(x,y,\ldots)$ and evaluated arguments $<a$,A$>$,
$<b$,B$>$, $\ldots$ as in the previous section, the interpreter 
tries to find an appropriate $f$ to apply. The first attempt involves
constructing a list of the domains A, B, ... of the evaluated arguments,
plus the target type of the function call, if it exists,\footnote{
As an example of a target type, consider the expression 
{\tt m:Matrix(Integer):=f(x,y,z)}. The target type of the function
call is {\tt Matrix(Integer)}.}
plus those types contained in any of the argument types if they are
constructed from {\bf Record}, {\bf Union}, or {\bf Mapping}. Duplicates
are removed from the list and domains and packages in the list are
searched for an applicable $f$. If a modemap is found of the form
\begin{verbatim}
   f: (A,B,...) -> T from C
\end{verbatim}
with arity $n$, for some {\bf T} and {\bf C}, the function is gotten
from {\bf C} and applied to $a,b,\ldots$ to yield a result {\sl t}
and subsequent value pair $<t$,T$>$.

This kind of search for an applicable $f$ generalizes the idea of a 
{\sl controlling object} in a function call \cite{Lisk79}\cite{Scha86}. 
In Axiom, though,
the arguments in a function call need not give any hint to the actual
location of the function to be applied. If there is no applicable 
modemap to be found among the argument domains of a function, a two-stage
search for a suitable modemap is made in the global modemap database. A
set $M$ of candidate modemaps is constructed, each of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
   f:(D,E,...) -> T if p from C
\end{verbatim}
for some result type {\bf T} and domain of implementation {\bf C},
each of arity $n$ and each generally containing pattern variables and
predicates $p$. The set $M$ is partitioned into two subsets: those
modemaps coming from domains or packages whose names contain those of
any of the arguments of the function, and those that do not. The
modemaps in the first subset are examined for applicability and, if
one is found, it is returned. Otherwise, those in the second subset
are checked for applicability.

At first this partitioning may seem odd, but it reflects a naming
convention for domains and packages in the Axiom library. As an 
example, the constructor {\bf ListPackage1} takes one {\bf Set}
argument and implements several functions that could be but are not
now implemented in the {\bf List} domain. The constructor
{\bf ListPackage2} takes two domain arguments, each belonging to the
category {\bf Set}. The functions in this package implement operations
that requires lists with two different element types. For example,
the function
\begin{verbatim}
   map: (S -> T, List(S)) -> List(T)
\end{verbatim}
which maps a function from {\bf S} to {\bf T} across the elements
of {\bf List(S)}, producing an object of {\bf List(T)}, is implemented
in {\bf ListPackage2(S,T)}. Looking at the modemaps in the first
partition of $M$ reflects an extension of the search method that
looks for applicable functions in the domains of the function 
arguments. In the future we anticipate using attributes in such
associated packages to determine the first subset of the general
candidate modemaps. That is, {\bf ListPackage2} will contain the
attribute {\bf associated("List")} in its category.

For our purposes here, it suffices to regard the predicate of a
modemap as a conjunction of simple predicates of two kinds:
\begin{verbatim}
   X is Y
   X has Y
\end{verbatim}

Predicates of the first kinds state that pattern $X$ matches
only the explicit domain {\tt Y}. If a modemap only has predicates
of the first kind, patterns are replaced by the domain or package
names to produce a new modemap free of patterns.

When the modemap has predicates of the second kind, substitutions
are sought for the pattern variables such that the predicate is
satisfied. Here {\tt Y} is a category or an attribute. Pattern
variables are given initial substitutions based on the value pairs
of the arguments. Any pattern variable $X$ for which there is a 
predicate ``$X$ is {\tt Y}'' has {\tt Y} assigned as a {\sl permanent}
substitution. Other substitutions are labeled {\sl tentative}. To
satisfy the predicate, any or all the operations of {\sl coercing},
{\sl resolving}, and {\sl forcing} (see below) may be necessary. As
above, if pattern variable $X$ has permanent substitution {\tt Y},
any argument value of $f$ of type {\bf Z} must be coerced to type {\tt Y}.

The {\sl resolve} of two types {\bf T1} and {\bf T2} will always succeed.
It produces a third type {\bf T3} to which all objects of type {\bf T1}
and {\bf T2} can be coerced. The type {\bf Any} is used for {\bf T3}
if a less general type cannot be found. Resolving is necessary to use 
a modemap with homogeneous arguments. For example, the modemap
\begin{verbatim}
   "+":(*1,*1) -> *1 if *1 has AbelianMonoid from *1
\end{verbatim}
is used for addition in most algebraic domains in Axiom. Given an
expression $1+(2/3)$, a bottom-up analysis will first produce
$<$1,Integer$>$ and $<$2/3,RationalNumber$>$ as the values of the
two operands of ``$+$''. The resolve of {\bf Integer} and
{\bf RationalNumber} is defined to be {\bf RationalNumber}. This
causes the integer object $1$ to be coerced to the rational number
object $1/1$. {\bf RationalNumber} now matches *1 in the above
modemap, the predicate evaluates to true, and the corresponding
function is gotten from {\bf RationalNumber} and applied to produce
the result $5/3$ and pair $<$5/3,RationalNumber$>$.

A {\sl force} is an operation performed on one or more types to satisfy
a predicate. For example, the predicate ``*1 has {\bf Field}'' where
*1 has a tentative substitution {\bf Integer} results in the forcing
of {\bf Integer} to {\bf RationalNumber} by the application of
{\bf QuotientField}, i.e. {\bf QuotientField(Integer)} is equivalent
to {\bf RationalNumber}. As another example, $x$ has default type
{\bf Symbol}. When appearing in a sum (e.g. $x+1$), the modemap of $x$
requires its argument to be from a domain which belongs to the category
{\bf AbelianMonoid}. As a result, {\bf Symbol} is forced to 
{\bf Polynomial(Integer)}.

A list of all applicable modemaps is produced together with a list of
required coercions on the source parameters. Duplicates and modemaps
subsumed by others are discarded. Each modemap is assigned a cost based
on the required coercions and the target type of the operation. By
definition of the cost function, any modemap which directly matches
the argument types (e.g. {\bf A=D}, {B=E}, etc.) will have the 
cheapest cost.

\subsection{Ambiguity}

Two remaining modemaps are said to be {\sl ambiguous} unless there are
coercions to and from the respective substitution datatypes for the
pattern variables *1,*2,... . If there are no ambiguities, the cheapest
modemap is selected and applied.

As a practical matter, users can always use a ``package call'' to avoid
ambiguities, e.g. {\tt x *\$D y} and {\tt foo\$D(x,y)} direct the
interpreter to apply the functions ``*'' and {\sl foo} from the 
domain or package {\bf D}. Package calling is the only way to identify
uniquely functions of no arguments if they are ambiguous.

\subsection{Modes}

If the explicit conversion {\tt p::P} or {\tt p::P(?)} is given, 
{\tt p} is converted to a polynomial. The datatype of coefficients
may be any domain which satisfies the categorical requirements of the
argument to the domain constructor {\tt Polynomial}. The form {\tt P(?)}
is a {\sl mode} specification rather than a {\sl type} specification: 
the interpreter is free to choose what replaces the {\tt ?}.

A mode is a partial type specification in that zero or more arguments
in a domain constructor call are replaced by {\tt ?}. The process
of {\sl merging} takes a type {\bf T1} and a mode {\bf M} and
determines type substitutions for the {\tt ?}'s in {\bf M} to 
create a new type {\bf T2} to which {\bf T1} is coercable. For example,
the merger of {\bf RationalNumber} and {\bf Polynomial(?)} is
{\bf Polynomial{RationalNumber}}. If the mode {\bf M} has no {\tt ?}'s,
it is a type and the merger will only succeed if {\bf T1} is coercable
to {\bf M}. Thus merging a type and a mode may fail, unlike resolving
two types. If {\bf M} is simply {\tt ?}, then the result of the merger
is {\bf T1}.

Axiom now only supports modes with at most one {\tt ?}, and that
must be in the innermost constructor call position (e.g.
{\bf List(Polynomial(?))}. In our experience, this restriction has
not seemed burdensome, though a future area of research might be the
extension of the merging process to more general modes.

\section{The Coerce Facility}

Our goal in the design of the coerce facility is to have as much as
possible controlled by modemap selection of compiled Axiom
functions. This allows the domain and package writer maximum control
over the behaviour of the interpreter and removes the requirement of
having a system developer tune the interpreter for dealing with new
datatypes. The coerce facility has several components.

\subsection{Coerce by Function}

The interpreter does modemap selection for an operation named
{\sl {\bf coerce}} that has the appropriate argument and target
types. This is the easist way for a programmer to control the
coerce facility. For example, the category {\bf Ring} provides
a modemap
\begin{verbatim}
   coerce: Integer -> R from R
\end{verbatim}
where {\bf R} is the ring being defined. Thus any ring has a coercion
from {\bf Integer} and, in fact, this operation has a default 
categorical definition.

Coercions can sometimes be defined in domains but are often defined in
packages. A coercion of the form
\begin{verbatim}
   coerce: Polynomial(QuotientField(R)) ->
     QuotientField(Polynomial(R))
       if R has IntegralDomain
\end{verbatim}
would typically be defined in a package parameterized by the domain
{\bf R}. On the other hand, it is not feasible to have so many 
explicit coercions being written and, in fact, there are general
methods that will perform these kinds of coercions.

It is not now possible to define a coercion of the form
\begin{verbatim}
   coerce: List(S) -> List(T)
\end{verbatim}
in the domain constructor {\bf List}. This is because {\bf List} is
parameterized by only one set ({\bf S} or {\bf T}) and the modemap
cannot, therefore, be part of the category of {\bf List}. Such an
explicit coercion can be provided in a package, but is, in fact,
handled by the general mechanism described in the next section.

\subsection{Coerce by Mapping}

When the interpreter encounters a coercion of the form
\begin{verbatim}
   D(T1) -> D(T2)
\end{verbatim}
where {\bf D} is a domain constructor with a parameter (for reasons
of exposition, we here omit the case of {\bf D} having multiple
parameters), it looks for a function
\begin{verbatim}
   map: (T1 -> T2, D(T1)) -> D(T2)
\end{verbatim}
that takes a function from {\bf T1} to {\bf T2} and an object of
{\bf D(T1)} and produces an object of {\bf D(T2)}. It then creates
a function stub that coerces objects of {\bf T1} to those of {\bf T2}
and passes it to {\sl {\bf map}}, along with the original argument.

Since the function {\sl {\bf map}} is part of the library of Axiom
compiled code, it allows the package writer to automatically provide
an interpreter mechanism of ``lifting'' coercions from {\bf T1} to
{\bf T1} to {\bf D(T1)} and {\bf D(T2)}.

\subsection{Coerce by Internal System Code}

Some special cases of coercions are handled by internal system code
rather than compiled Axiom code. These typically involve polynomials
where the variable ordering is changed or distributed across a tower
of parameterized domains. It will eventually be moved into Axiom code
as the pattern matching facilities are improved.

Another case that is now handled internally involves rearrangement
of a tower of paramterized domains. The domain constructor {\bf Gaussian}
creates domains with objects similar to the complex numbers in that they
contain real and imaginary parts. The coercion
\begin{verbatim}
   Gaussian(Polynomial(RationalNumber)) ->
      QuotientField(Polynomial(Gaussian(Integer)))
\end{verbatim}
is performed in the following steps. The type {\bf RationalNumber}
is changed into the equivalent type {\bf QuotientField(Integer)} and
the {\bf QuotientField} is bubbled to the top of the original type to
get {\bf QuotientField(Gaussian(Polynomial(Integer)))}. This new type
and the old target now have the same top level constructor 
({\bf QuotientField}) and the coerce facility is called recursively
on the underlying domains {\bf Gaussian(Polynomial(Integer))} and
{\bf Polynomial(Gaussian(Integer))}.

\subsection{Coercion of Algebraic Constants}

Several categories specify the existence of constants. For example,
{\bf AbelianMonoid} specifies the operation ``$+$'':\$ $\rightarrow$ \$'' and
the constant $0:\$$. If {\bf T1} and {\bf T2} each belong to a common
category with specified constants and the object of {\bf T1} to be
coerced is one of the constants, the corresponding constant in {\bf T2}
may be extacted and returned.

\subsection{Retraction}

A retraction is a coercion of an object of a domain to a more specific
(degenerate) domain. Unlike other forms of coercion where the target
type is known, retraction involves examining an operand pair $<t$,T$>$
to see if there exists a degenerate form of {\bf T} to which $t$ can
be coerced. For example, $<$7/1,RationalNumber$>$ retracts to 
$<$7,Integer$>$ and $<$1,Polynomial(Integer)$>$ retracts to $<$1,Integer$>$.
Retraction can occur multiple times, so arbitrarily long sructures collapse
to their simplest forms, e.g. $<$1,Polynomial(RationalNumber)$>$ to 
$<$1,Integer$>$.

If no applicable modemap is found in modemap selection, retraction is
done on the arguments and then selection is attempted again. Retraction
is also attempted when a coercion is requested from a domain to its
underlying domain. For example, if {\tt p} is an element of
{\bf Polynomial(Integer)}, the statement {\tt p::I} will cause the
interpreter to try to retract {\tt p} to an element of {\bf Integer}.

For the most part, retraction can be accomplished by functions in the
Axiom library. The category {\bf RetractWithUnderDomain(R)} specifies
two operations
\begin{verbatim}
   retractable? : $ -> Boolean
   retract :      $ -> R
\end{verbatim}

In our example of polynomials above, the function {\sl {\bf retractable?}}
would be called to see if the object was a constant polynomial. If the
result was {\sl true}, {\sl {\bf retract}} can be called to extract the
constant.

\subsection{Coercion Query}

There are situations where one wishes to know ahead of time whether it
is possible to coerce an object of type {\bf T1} to one of type 
{\bf T2}. The Axiom interpreter provides this information, for example, to
the type resolve and modemap selection facilities. The facility is
used when one needs to know absolutely when a coercion will be
successful. An answer of ``no'', however, does not guarantee that a
coercion could not be performed for specific data. For example the
system will respond ``no'' when asked whether an object of 
{\bf Polynomial(Integer)} can be coerced to an object of {\bf Integer}.
As we saw above, though, retractions can be performed for constant
polynomials.

\section{The Resolve Facility}

The resolve facility is used to determine a type {\bf T3} to which two
types {\bf T1} and {\bf T2} can be coerced. It is used when an
operation has homogeneous arguments (such as ``$+$'') or when a
statement has several exit points and they must all return the same
type ({\tt then} and {\tt else} clauses of an {\tt if} statement, or
multiple {\tt return} statements in a function).

The resolve facility is symmetric: {\tt resolve({\bf T1},{\bf T2})} $=$
{\tt resolve({\bf T2},{\bf T1})}. The resolve facility is always successful
because type {\bf Any} is returned if a less general type cannot be found.
{\bf Any} is represented by a record with two components, the first being
the original type of the object and the second being the object itself.
Thus anything can be coerced to an object of type {\bf Any} and
{\tt resolve({\bf Any},{\bf T})} $=$ {\bf Any} for all {\bf T}.

Two other types have special resolve rules. Type {\bf Void} has but 
one object and is the type returned by such operations as variable
declaration, function definition, {\tt if} statements without {\tt else}
clauses and {\tt repeat} loops. Several functions also return the object
of type {\bf Void}, including those that display things in two dimensional
algebaic, 
TeX\footnote{TeX is a trademark of the American Mathematical Society} 
and FORTRAN forms. Like {\bf Any}, {\tt resolve({\bf Void},{\bf T})}
$=$ {\bf Void} for all {\bf T}. Type {\bf Exit} is used for {\tt return}
statements and error statements. Its rule is 
{\tt resolve({\bf Exit},{\bf T})} $=$ {\bf T} for all {\bf T}.

After some checks for special cases, the resolve facility has three
components.

\subsection{Resolve by Coercion Query}

If {\bf T1} $=$ {\bf T2}, then the resolve of the pair is just {\bf T1}.
If {\bf T1} can be coerced to {\bf T2} and {\bf T2} cannot be coerced to
{\bf T1}, then {\tt resolve({\bf T1},{\bf T2})} $=$ {\bf T2}. If {\bf T1}
and {\bf T2} are coercable to one another, an arbitrary but canonical
choice is made and returned.

\subsection{Resolve by Rules}

The interpreter has an internal database of rules which it tries to use
to resolve two types. The rules are not complete, as they only attempt
to take care of cases that cannot be dealt with in a more general way.
Almost all of the rules deal with polynomials. For example, one rule is
\begin{verbatim}
   resolve(Polynomial(T1),UnivariatePoly(x,T2))=
      resolve(Polynomial(T1),T2)
\end{verbatim}

The variable of {\bf UnivariatePoly} can be absorbed into the general
constructor {\bf Polynomial} and then the resolve facility is called
again with different arguments. The second call may or may not use
the rule system. 

\subsection{Resolve by Type Destructuring}

This type of resolution is similar to the process involved in the
coercion described in the last paragraph of ``Coerce by Internal
System Code''. Given two towers of parameterized types, the
interpreter tries to rearrange the towers and create a new type to
which both of the original types are coerceable. This is a recursive
process and involves using the coercion query facility to determine
what tower rearrangements are possible.

\section{An Example}
As an example of coerce and resolve, we describe the inference involved
in determining that the expression $x+1/2$ evaluates to an object of the
datatype {\bf Polynomial(RationalNumber)}. We assume $x$ has not 
previously been given a value.

\begin{itemize}
\item Choose a default datatype of {\bf Symbol} for $x$
\item Choose the datatype of {\bf Integer} for 1 and 2
\item Look for an operation ``$/$'' in {\bf Integer} that has two
arguments, each an integer. It is not found.
\item Start a general search in the library for an operation ``$/$''
with two {\bf Integer} arguments. One is found in 
{\bf RationalNumber} and applied
\item Look for a ``$+$'' that takes a {\bf Symbol} and a 
{\bf RationalNumber}. None is found.
\item Force $x$ to an object of type {\bf Polynomial(Integer)}
\item Look for a ``$+$'' that takes a {\bf Polynomial(Integer)} and
a {\bf RationalNumber}. None is found.
\item Start a general search in the library for ``$+$'' operations.
The only ones found take two arguments, each of the same datatype.
Resolve {\bf Polynomial(Integer)} and {\bf RationalNumber} to get the
datatype {\bf Polynomial(RationalNumber)}
\item Do the coercions
\begin{verbatim}
   Polynomial(Integer) -> Polynomial(RationalNumber)
   RationalNumber -> Polynomial(RationalNumber)
\end{verbatim}
\item Apply the ``$+$'' in the datatype {\bf Polynomial(RationalNumber)}
and return the result
\end{itemize}

\section{Frames and the Interpreter Frame Ring}
\label{TheFrameMechanism}

Axiom has the notion of ``frames''. A frame is a data structure which
holds all the vital data from an Axiom session. 

The list of frames is structured as a ring.
New frames can be added which will hold computations of independent
information. The interpreter {\bf )frame} command allows operations
on frames. From the command line the user can create, modify, change,
and delete frames.

\begin{chunk}{frame.help}
====================================================================
A.11.  )frame
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )frame  new  frameName
  - )frame  drop  [frameName]
  - )frame  next
  - )frame  last
  - )frame  names
  - )frame  import frameName [objectName1 [objectName2 ...] ]
  - )set message frame on | off
  - )set message prompt frame
 
Command Description: 
 
A frame can be thought of as a logical session within the physical session
that you get when you start the system. You can have as many frames as you
want, within the limits of your computer's storage, paging space, and so on.
Each frame has its own step number, environment and history. You can have a
variable named a in one frame and it will have nothing to do with anything
that might be called a in any other frame.
 
Some frames are created by the HyperDoc program and these can have pretty
strange names, since they are generated automatically. To find out the names
of all frames, issue
 
)frame names
 
It will indicate the name of the current frame.
 
You create a new frame ``quark'' by issuing
 
)frame new quark
 
The history facility can be turned on by issuing either )set history on or
)history )on. If the history facility is on and you are saving history
information in a file rather than in the AXIOM environment then a history
file with filename quark.axh will be created as you enter commands. If you
wish to go back to what you were doing in the ``initial'' frame, use
 
)frame next
 
or
 
)frame last
 
to cycle through the ring of available frames to get back to ``initial''.
 
If you want to throw away a frame (say ``quark''), issue
 
)frame drop quark
 
If you omit the name, the current frame is dropped.
 
If you do use frames with the history facility on and writing to a file, you
may want to delete some of the older history files. These are directories, so
you may want to issue a command like rm -r quark.axh to the operating system.
 
You can bring things from another frame by using )frame import. For example,
to bring the f and g from the frame ``quark'' to the current frame, issue
 
)frame import quark f g
 
If you want everything from the frame ``quark'', issue
 
)frame import quark
 
You will be asked to verify that you really want everything.
 
There are two )set flags to make it easier to tell where you are.
 
)set message frame on | off
 
will print more messages about frames when it is set on. By default, it is
off.
 
)set message prompt frame
 
will give a prompt that looks like
 
initial (1) ->
 
when you start up. In this case, the frame name and step make up the prompt.
 
Also See: 
o )history
o )set
 
\end{chunk} 
\footnote{
\fnref{history}
\fnref{set}}

The frame mechanism uses several dollar variables.

Primary variables are those which exist solely to make the frame
mechanism work. 

The \$interpreterFrameName contains a symbol which is the name
of the current frame in use. 

The \$interpreterFrameRing contains a list of all of the existing
frames. The first frame on the list is the ``current'' frame. When
Axiom is started directly there is only one frame named ``initial''.

If the system is started under sman (using the axiom shell script,
for example), there are two frames, ``initial'' and ``frame0''. In
this case, ``frame0'' is the current frame. This can cause subtle
problems because functions defined in the axiom initialization file
(.axiom.input) will be defined in frame ``initial'' but the current
frame will be ``frame0''. They will appear to be undefined. However,
if the user does ``)frame next'' they can switch to the ``initial''
frame and see the functions correctly defined.

The \$frameMessages variable controls when frame messages will be
displayed. The variable is initially NIL. It can be set on (T) or off (NIL)
using the system command:
\begin{verbatim}
    )set message frame on | off
\end{verbatim}
Setting frame messages on will output a line detailing the 
current frame after every output is complete. 

See the {\bf set message frame}\refto{setmessageframe} section
for more details.

The frame collects and uses a few top level variables. These are:
\$InteractiveFrame, \$IOindex, \$HiFiAccess, \$HistList, \$HistListLen,
\$HistListAct, \$HistRecord, \$internalHistoryTable, and \$localExposureData.

These variables can also be changed by the frame mechanism when the user
requests changing to a different frame.

\section{Data Structures}

The interpreter information is kept in a frame which is a 10 part data
structure of the form (see \ref{emptyInterpreterFrame}).
The parts of a frame and their initial, default values are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf \$interpreterFrameName}\refto{interpreterFrameName}, 
a string, is the name of the current frame. 
\item {\bf \$InteractiveFrame}\refto{InteractiveFrame}
which defaults to ((nil))
\item {\bf \$IOindex}\refto{IOindex}
also known as the step number, which defaults to 1
\item {\bf \$HiFiAccess}\refto{HiFiAccess}
\item {\bf \$HistList}\refto{HistList}
\item {\bf \$HistListLen}\refto{HistListLen}
\item {\bf \$HistListAct}\refto{HistListAct}
\item {\bf \$HistRecord}\refto{HistRecord}
\item {\bf \$internalHistoryTable}\refto{internalHistoryTable} 
which defaults to nil 
\item {\bfref{localExposureDataDefault}} is a copy of the current 
local exposure data
\end{enumerate}

There are a set of functions to manipulate frames.
The internal set of frame functions are
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bfref{initializeInterpreterFrameRing}} creates the original
frame ring, inserts an initial frame, and updates all the global
variables from the initial frame.
\item {\bfref{emptyInterpreterFrame}} creates a new, empty frame.
\item {\bfref{createCurrentInterpreterFrame}} collects the environment
into a frame.
\item {\bfref{updateFromCurrentInterpreterFrame}} sets all of the
global variables from the current frame.
\item {\bfref{frameEnvironment}} returns the frameInteractive
component of a named frame or a new, empty environment.
\item {\bfref{findFrameInRing}} given the name, find the named frame
\item {\bfref{updateCurrentInterpreterFrame}} collects the normal 
contents of the world into a frame object, places it first on the frame 
list, and then sets the current values of the world from the frame object. 
\item {\bfref{nextInterpreterFrame}} updates the current frame to make 
sure all of the current information is recorded. If there are more frame 
elements in the list then this will destructively move the current frame
to the end of the list, that is, assume the frame list reads (1 2 3)
this function will destructively change it to (2 3 1).
\item {\bfref{previousInterpreterFrame}} moves to the previous 
frame in the ring.
\item {\bfref{changeToNamedInterpreterFrame}} change to the named
frame.
\item {\bfref{addNewInterpreterFrame}} update the current frame,
initialize the history, make a new empty frame, and initialize all of the
global variables from the empty frame.
\item {\bfref{closeInterpreterFrame}} when there is more than one
frame, delete the current frame and initialize all the global variables
from the next frame in the ring.
\item {\bfref{displayFrameNames}} print all the frame names and
indicate which one is the current frame.
\item {\bfref{importFromFrame}} imports items from a different
frame into the current frame
\end{itemize}

\Defun{initializeInterpreterFrameRing}{Initializing the Interpreter Frame Ring}

There can be multiple frames and these live in a top-level variable called
{\bf \$interpreterFrameRing}. This variable holds a circular list of frames.

This function creates an empty, initial frame named ``initial'' and
creates a list of frames containing an empty frame. This list is the
interpreter frame ring and is not actually circular but is managed as
a circular list.

As a final step we update the world from this frame. This has the
side-effect of resetting all the important global variables to their
initial values.

\defdollar{interpreterFrameName}
The \verb|$interpreterFrameName| variable, set in

initial to indicate that this is the initial (default) frame.

Frames are structures that capture all of the variables defined in a
session. There can be multiple frames and the user can freely switch
between them. Frames are kept in a ring data structure so you can 
move around the ring.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$interpreterFrameName| '|initial|)

\defdollar{InteractiveFrame}
{\bf \verb|$InteractiveFrame|} is the environment where the user
values are stored.  Any side effects of evaluation of a top-level
expression are stored in this environment.  It is always used as
the starting environment for interpretation.

This variable is set in the {\bf restart} function as the value returned
by {\bf makeInitialModemapFrame|}.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$InteractiveFrame| nil)

The \verb|$IOindex| variable is the number associated with the input prompt.
Every successful expression evaluated increments this number until a

\chapter{The Message Mechanism}
Throughout the interpreter there are messages printed using a symbol
for a database lookup. This was done to enable translation of these
messages languages other than English.

Axiom messages are read from a flat file database and returned
as one long string.  They are preceded in the database by a key and
this is how they are referenced from code.  For example, one key is
S2IL0001 which means:
\begin{verbatim}
   S2          Scratchpad II designation
   I           from the interpreter
   L           originally from LISPLIB BOOT
   0001        a sequence number
\end{verbatim}

Each message may contain formatting codes and and parameter codes.
The formatting codes are:
\begin{verbatim}
   %ceoff      turn off centering
   %ceon       turn on centering
   %d          turn off bright printing
   %f          user defined printing
   %i          start indentation of 3 more spaces
   %l          start a new line
   %m          math-print an expression
   %rjoff      turn off right justification (actually ragged left)
   %rjon       turn on right justification (actually ragged left)
   %s          pretty-print as an S-expression
   %u          unindent 3 spaces
   %x#         insert # spaces
\end{verbatim}

The parameter codes look like \%1, \%2b, \%3p, \%4m, \%5bp, \%6s where the
digit is the parameter number and the letters following indicate
additional formatting. You can indicate as many additional formatting
qualifiers as you like, to the degree they make sense. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``p'' code means to call prefix2String on the parameter, 
a standard way of printing abbreviated types.  
\item The ``P'' operator maps prefix2String over its arguments.  
\item The ``o'' operation formats the argument as an operation name.  
\item The ``b'' means to print that parameter in a bold (bright) font. 
\item The ``c'' means to center that parameter on a new line.
\item The ``r'' means to right justify (ragged left) the argument.
\item The ``f'' means that the parameter is a list [fn, :args]
and that ``fn'' is to be called on ``args'' to get the text.

\chapter{The History Mechanism}
\defdollar{HiFiAccess}
The \verb|$HiFiAccess| is set by initHist to T. It is a flag
used by the history mechanism to record whether the history function
is currently on. It can be reset by using the axiom
command
\begin{verbatim}
  )history off
\end{verbatim}
It appears that the name means ``History File Access''.

The \verb|$HiFiAccess| variable is used by historySpad2Cmd to check
whether history is turned on. T means it is, NIL means it is not.
This is remembered in the current frame.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$HiFiAccess| nil "Is the history function on?")

\end{chunk}

\defdollar{HistList}
Thie \verb|$HistList| variable is set by initHistList to an initial
value of NIL elements. The last element of the list is smashed to
point to the first element to make the list circular.
This is a circular list of length \verb|$HistListLen|.
This is remembered in the current frame.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$HistList| nil "A circular list of history elements")

\end{chunk}

\defdollar{HistListLen}
The \verb|$HistListLen| variable is set by initHistList to 20.
This is the length of a circular list maintained in the variable
\verb|$HistList|.
This is remembered in the current frame.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$HistListLen| 0 "The length of the circular history list")

\end{chunk}

\defdollar{HistListAct}
The \verb|$HistListAct| variable is set by initHistList to 0.
This variable holds the actual number of elements in the history list.
This is the number of ``undoable'' steps.
This is remembered in the current frame.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$HistLIstAct| 0 "The number of un-doable steps")

\end{chunk}

\defdollar{internalHistoryTable}
The \verb|$internalHistoryTable| variable is set at load time by a call to
initvars to a value of NIL.
It is part of the history mechanism.
This is remembered in the current frame.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$internalHistoryTable| nil)

\end{chunk}

\defdollar{HistRecord}
The \verb|$HistRecord| variable is set by initHistList to NIL.
\verb|$HistRecord| collects the input line, all variable bindings
and the output of a step, before it is written to the file named by
the function histFileName.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$HistRecord| nil)

\end{chunk}

\defdollar{historyFileType}
The \verb|$historyFileType| is set at load time by a call to 
initvars to a value of ``axh''. It appears that this
is intended to be used as a filetype extension.
It is part of the history mechanism. It is used in makeHistFileName
as part of the history file name.

\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$historyFileType| nil)

\end{chunk}

\chapter{The undo mechanism}
\section{Data Structures}
\verb|$frameRecord = [delta1, delta2,... ]| where
delta(i) contains changes in the ``backwards'' direction.
Each delta(i) has the form \verb|((var . proplist)...)| where
proplist denotes an ordinary proplist. For example, an entry
of the form \verb|((x (value) (mode (Integer)))...)| indicates that
to undo 1 step, x's value is cleared and its mode should be set
to (Integer).

A delta(i) of the form (systemCommand . delta) is a special
delta indicating changes due to system commands executed between
the last command and the current command. By recording these deltas
separately, it is possible to undo to either BEFORE or AFTER
the command. These special delta(i)s are given ONLY when a
a system command is given which alters the environment.

recordFrame('system) is called before a command is executed, and
recordFrame('normal) is called after (see processInteractive1).
If no changes are found for former, no special entry is given.

The \verb|$previousBindings| is a copy of the 
\verb|CAAR $InteractiveFrame|. This is used to
compute the delta(i)s stored in \verb|$frameRecord|.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to trace the execution of functions that make up the
AXIOM system, functions defined by users, and functions from the system
library. Almost all options are available for each type of function but
exceptions will be noted below.
 
To list all functions, constructors, domains and packages that are traced,
simply issue
 
)trace
 
To untrace everything that is traced, issue
 
)trace )off
 
When a function is traced, the default system action is to display the
arguments to the function and the return value when the function is exited.
Note that if a function is left via an action such as a THROW, no return
value will be displayed. Also, optimization of tail recursion may decrease
the number of times a function is actually invoked and so may cause less
trace information to be displayed. Other information can be displayed or
collected when a function is traced and this is controlled by the various
options. Most options will be of interest only to AXIOM system developers. If
a domain or package is traced, the default action is to trace all functions
exported.
 
Individual interpreter, lisp or boot functions can be traced by listing their
names after )trace. Any options that are present must follow the functions to
be traced.
 
)trace f
 
traces the function f. To untrace f, issue
 
)trace f )off
 
Note that if a function name contains a special character, it will be
necessary to escape the character with an underscore
 
)trace _/D_,1
 
To trace all domains or packages that are or will be created from a
particular constructor, give the constructor name or abbreviation after
)trace.
 
)trace MATRIX
)trace List Integer
 
The first command traces all domains currently instantiated with Matrix. If
additional domains are instantiated with this constructor (for example, if
you have used Matrix(Integer) and Matrix(Float)), they will be automatically
traced. The second command traces List(Integer). It is possible to trace
individual functions in a domain or package. See the )ops option below.
 
The following are the general options for the )trace command.
 
  )break after
    causes a Lisp break loop to be entered after exiting the traced function.
 
  )break before
    causes a Lisp break loop to be entered before entering the traced
    function.
 
  )break
    is the same as )break before.
 
  )count
    causes the system to keep a count of the number of times the traced
    function is entered. The total can be displayed with )trace )stats and
    cleared with )trace )stats reset.
 
  )count n
    causes information about the traced function to be displayed for the
    first n executions. After the nth execution, the function is untraced.
 
  )depth n
    causes trace information to be shown for only n levels of recursion of
    the traced function. The command
 
    )trace fib )depth 10
 
    will cause the display of only 10 levels of trace information for the
    recursive execution of a user function fib.
 
  )math
    causes the function arguments and return value to be displayed in the
    AXIOM monospace two-dimensional math format.
 
  )nonquietly
    causes the display of additional messages when a function is traced.
 
  )nt
    This suppresses all normal trace information. This option is useful if
    the )count or )timer options are used and you are interested in the
    statistics but not the function calling information.
 
  )off
    causes untracing of all or specific functions. Without an argument, all
    functions, constructors, domains and packages are untraced. Otherwise,
    the given functions and other objects are untraced. To immediately
    retrace the untraced functions, issue )trace )restore.
 
  )only listOfDataToDisplay
    causes only specific trace information to be shown. The items are listed
    by using the following abbreviations:
 
    a        display all arguments
    v        display return value
    1        display first argument
    2        display second argument
    15       display the 15th argument, and so on
 
  )restore
    causes the last untraced functions to be retraced. If additional options
    are present, they are added to those previously in effect.
 
  )stats
    causes the display of statistics collected by the use of the )count and
    )timer options.
 
  )stats reset
    resets to 0 the statistics collected by the use of the )count and )timer
    options.
 
  )timer
    causes the system to keep a count of execution times for the traced
    function. The total can be displayed with )trace )stats and cleared with
    )trace )stats reset.
 
  )varbreak var1 [... varN]
    causes a Lisp break loop to be entered after the assignment to any of the
    listed variables in the traced function.
 
  )vars
    causes the display of the value of any variable after it is assigned in
    the traced function. Note that library code must have been compiled (see
    description of command )compile ) using the )vartrace option in order to
    support this option.
 
  )vars var1 [... varN]
    causes the display of the value of any of the specified variables after
    they are assigned in the traced function. Note that library code must
    have been compiled (see description of command )compile ) using the
    )vartrace option in order to support this option.
 
  )within executingFunction
    causes the display of trace information only if the traced function is
    called when the given executingFunction is running.
 
The following are the options for tracing constructors, domains and packages.
 
  )local [op1 [... opN] ]
    causes local functions of the constructor to be traced. Note that to
    untrace an individual local function, you must use the fully qualified
    internal name, using the escape character _ before the semicolon.
 
    )trace FRAC )local
    )trace FRAC_;cancelGcd )off
 
  )ops op1 [... opN]
    By default, all operations from a domain or package are traced when the
    domain or package is traced. This option allows you to specify that only
    particular operations should be traced. The command
 
    )trace Integer )ops min max _+ _-
 
    traces four operations from the domain Integer. Since + and - are special
    characters, it is necessary to escape them with an underscore.

The {\bf trace3} examines the options to the top level trace command
and builds the lambda expression in the variable {\bf newdef}
\begin{verbatim}
  (lambda (&rest g6) (monitorx g6 fn ll))
\end{verbatim}
The {\bf fn} variable is an uninterned gensym name that is unique.
The {\bf ll} variable is a list of 
\begin{itemize}
\item tracename -- The spad internal name for a function from a
domain which can be found in the compiler output files. 
e.g. Polynomial.univariate.21
\item (when g4 'macro) -- most likely nil
\item tracecode -- a string controlling what tracing will occur 
where tracecode means
\begin{verbatim}
  ; 0:        Caller (0,1)           print caller if 1
  ; 1:        Value (0,1)            print value if 1
  ; 2...:     Arguments (0,...,9)    stop if 0; print ith if i; all if 9
\end{verbatim}
\item countnam -- 
\item timernam --
\item before -- An expression to execute before executing the function.
It defaults to 
\begin{verbatim}
  (eq nil nil)
\end{verbatim}
\item after --
\item condition --
\item break --
\item modemap -- The modemap for the function. For Polynomial.variables.15
it shows up as
\begin{verbatim}
  ((List (Symbol)) (Polynomial (Integer)))
\end{verbatim}
\item (list 'quote t) --

\defun{flattenOperationAlist}{flattenOperationAlist}
The operation alist for something like POLY(INT) is a list of
operations. Each operation, such as '*' is a list of all possible
signatures for '*'. For example, the operation alist looks like:
\begin{verbatim}
   (* (($ (|PositiveInteger|) $) NIL . (T . (ELT)))
      (($ $ $) NIL . (T . (ELT)))
      (($ $ |#1|) NIL . (T . (ELT)))
      (($ |#1| $) NIL . (T . (ELT)))
      (($ (|Fraction| (|Integer|))) NIL
       (|has| |#1| (|Algebra| (|Fraction| (|Integer|)))) . (ELT))
      ....)
\end{verbatim}
This function rearranges the operations so that each signature
is independent. Thus it becomes
\begin{verbatim}
   (* (($ (|PositiveInteger|) $) NIL . (T . (ELT))))
   (* (($ $ $) NIL . (T . (ELT))))
   (* (($ $ |#1|) NIL . (T . (ELT))))
   (* (($ |#1| $) NIL . (T . (ELT))))
   (* (($ (|Fraction| (|Integer|))) NIL
       (|has| |#1| (|Algebra| (|Fraction| (|Integer|)))) . (ELT)))

This function maintains an alist whose car is the domain to trace
and the cdr is the genvar. So for POLY(INT) it is called with
\begin{verbatim}
   y == (|Polynomial| (|Integer|))
\end{verbatim}
which, if it is already traced would be in the alist as
\begin{verbatim}
   (((|Polynomial| (|Integer|)) . $1))
\end{verbatim}
If it is not already traced it would be cons with a new genvar
and added to the alist.

The \verb|$current-directory| variable is set to the current directory 
at startup. This is used by the \verb|)cd| function and some of the 
compile routines. This is the result of the \refto{get-current-directory}
function. This variable is used to set \verb|*default-pathname-defaults*|.
The \refto{reroot} function resets it to \verb|$spadroot|.

An example of a runtime value is:
\begin{verbatim}
$current-directory = "/research/test/"
\end{verbatim}

\defdollar{current-directory}
\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar $current-directory nil)

The \verb|$directory-list| is a runtime list of absolute pathnames.
This list is generated by \refto{reroot} from the list of
relative paths held in the variable
\verb|$relative-directory-list|. Each entry will be prefixed by
\verb|$spadroot|.

An example of a runtime value is:
\begin{verbatim}

   "/research/test/mnt/ubuntu/doc/msgs/" 
   "/research/test/mnt/ubuntu/../../src/algebra/"

\defdollar{InitialModemapFrame}
\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar |$InitialModemapFrame| '((nil)))

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \verb|$library-directory-list| variable is the system-wide search
path for library files.  \refto{reroot} 
prepends the \verb|$spadroot| variable to the 
\verb|$relative-library-directory-list| variable.

An example of a runtime value is:
\begin{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \verb|$relative-directory-list| variable contains a hand-generated
list of directories used in the Axiom system.  The relative directory
list specifies a search path for files for the current directory
structure. It has been changed from the NAG distribution back to the
original form.

This list is used by the \refto{reroot} function to generate the absolute list
of paths held in the variable \verb|$directory-list|. Each entry will be
prefixed by \verb|$spadroot|.

An example of a runtime value is:
\begin{verbatim}
$relative-directory-list =
  ("/../../src/input/" 
   "/doc/msgs/" 
   "/../../src/algebra/" 
   "/../../src/interp/"

\end{chunk}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \verb|$relative-library-directory-list| is a hand-generated list of 
directories containing algebra. The \refto{reroot} function will prefix every
path in this list with the value of the \verb|$spadroot| variable
to construct the \verb|$library-directory-list| variable.

An example of a runtime value is:
\begin{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \verb|$spadroot| variable is the internal name for the AXIOM shell
variable.  It is set in reroot to the value of the argument. The value
is expected to be a directory name.  The \refto{initroot} function
uses this variable if the AXIOM shell variable is not set.  The
\refto{make-absolute-filename} function uses this path as a prefix to all of
the relative filenames to make them absolute.

An example of a runtime value is:
\begin{verbatim}
$spadroot = "/research/test/mnt/ubuntu"
\end{verbatim}

\defdollar{spadroot}
\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar $spadroot nil)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \verb|$SpadServer| determines whether Axiom acts as a remote server.

See the function \fnref{openserver}.

By working through this example we introduce, motivate, and explain
how the interpreter works, where and why functions are called, how
the system transitions from input strings to algebra, how the databases
are used, and more.

If you plan to maintain or modify the interpreter this information is
necessary. If you really want to know how Axiom works, this information
is useful. 

Each function call we describe has a link to the actual function so 
you can read the detailed code and see why it reacts as it does to 
the given input.

I've taken the liberty of adding comments that show the function
signature. Some of the types only exist as unnamed data structures
in the interpreter (e.g. "Server", which is really just a small
integer). They are introduced without definition simply as a 
documentation aid but may sometimes be defined a Common Lisp
deftypes for performance reasons.

{\bf A Note on Common Lisp Circular Notation}

You may not be familiar with circular notation in Common Lisp.
If a list contains a pointer back to itself or a sublist then the 
output would be an infinite stream. In order to prevent this
the circular notation is used. So for a list X,
\begin{verbatim}
 +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+
 + A |   + --> + B |   + --> + C |   + --> + D | / +
 +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+
\end{verbatim}
which is the list (A . (B . (C . (D . ())))). The printing rule
says that if a period is followed by a parenthesis then both
are suppressed. So this would print as (A B C D). 
But it could be that we execute
\begin{verbatim}
   (rplaca (last X) (cdr X))
\end{verbatim}
so the list now is
\begin{verbatim}
 +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+
 + A |   + --> + B |   + --> + C |   + --> +   | / +
 +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+     +---|---+
                 ^                           |
                 +---------------------------+
\end{verbatim}
and now the list X is cicular. This prints as
\begin{verbatim}
   (A . #0=(B C #0#))
\end{verbatim}
As you can see the \verb|#0=| introduces a unique label for the
cons cell pointed at by (CDR A). We stored that address in the
CAR of the last node. So the last node in the list uses the
previously defined label with the notation \verb|#0#|.

Circular notation is used extensively in Axiom since a lot of the
structures are shared or self-referential. You have to be careful
because, as a result of structure sharing, changing something in one
place can change an apparently unrelated structure by side-effect.

Axiom starts by invoking a function value of the lisp symbol
\verb|*top-level-hook*| which is normally unbound. 
The normal function invocation path is:
\begin{verbatim}
axiom -nox

lisp
 -> restart
 -> |spad|
 -> |runspad|
 -> |ncTopLevel|
 -> |ncIntLoop|
 -> |intloop|
 -> |SpadInterpretStream|
 ->   mkprompt                  -- outputs "(1) ->" to the console
 ->   |intloopReadConsole|      -- the Read-Eval-Print loop function
 ->     |serverReadLine|        -- does the actual read to the console
 -> process the input and recursively call |intloopReadConsole|
\end{verbatim}

\bfref{SpadInterpretStream} is called with a third arguments, {\bf
interactive?} set to {\bf t} so it sets up an interactive loop to read
from the console.  The other two arguments are ignored on the main
interpreter path.

\bfref{SpadInterpretStream} can also be called by the compiler,
with the {\bf interactive?} argument {\bf nil} to read from 
a file. See bookvol9.

\bfref{mkprompt} puts one of several kinds of prompts on the screen. In
the default case we include the step number.  The return value is not
used.

The \bfref{intloopReadConsole} function does tail-recursive calls to
itself and never exits. It is the primary Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL).

\bfref{intloopReadConsole}
reads the next line and calls one of three kinds of processors
\begin{enumerate}
\item \bfref{intnplisp} to handle )lisp input
\item \bfref{ncloopCommand} to handle )command input
\item \bfref{intloopProcessString} to handle everything else
\end{enumerate}

There are only two ways out of the REPL, either using the command
"{\bf )fin}" which drops into lisp or closing the *standard-input* stream.
If dropped into lisp, the top level loop can be restarted by calling
{\bf (restart)}.

{\bf intloopReadConsole} takes 2 arguments. The first is a String {\bf
prefix} which is usually an empty string but might contain prior lines
that ended with an underscore, the Axiom continuation character. The
second is an Integer which will be the step number printed at the
prompt.

\section{An Overview of a Simple Input}
Here we walk through details of Axiom's default behavior when handling
a simple input, the number 1. Many details are skipped in order to 
provide a simple overview of the interpreter operation. Further
details can be found at the specific functions.

Axiom is in \bfref{intloopReadConsole}, the Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) function and the user types ``1''.
\begin{verbatim}
  1> (|intloopReadConsole| "" 1)
       ; serverReadLine : Stream -> String
    2> (|serverReadLine| #<synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*>)
         ; is-console : Stream -> Boolean
      3> (IS-CONSOLE #<synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*>)
      <3 (IS-CONSOLE T)
         ; sockSendInt : (Purpose,Command) -> Integer
         ; Purpose 1 is SessionManager, Command 3 is EndOfOutput
         ; A return of 0 indicates success.
         ; see the socket types purpose list in bookvol7, chunk include/com.h
      3> (|sockSendInt| 1 3)
      <3 (|sockSendInt| 0)
         ; serverSwitch : Void -> Integer
         ; see server_switch in sockio.c
         ; this multiplexes the socket connection among front ends
         ; CallInterp is the constant 4 (see the table in sockio-c)
         ; CallInterp simply returns to the interpreter
      3> (|serverSwitch|)
1
      <3 (|serverSwitch| 4)
         ; the action for CallInterp is to call read-line
         ; read-line is defined in vmlisp.lisp
      3> (|read-line| #<synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*>)
      <3 (|read-line| "1" NIL)
    <2 (|serverReadLine| "1")
\end{verbatim}

Axiom calls \bfref{serverReadLine}
to read the integer from the console. First it calls {\bf is-console}
(bookvol9) to check that the console stream exists. 

{\bf sockSendInt} (see sockio.lisp, sockio-c.c) sends on socket 1
({\bf SessionManager}) a 3, meaning {\bf EndOfOutput}, i.e. a newline.

{\bf serverSwitch} (see sockio-c in bookvol7) multitasks among the different 
sockets and finds the interpreter socket is available, returning
4 ({\bf CallInterp}) (see sockio-c commands sent table and bookvol8).

\bfref{serverReadLine} has a cond switch for action {\bf \$CallInterp}.
In that case it calls {\bf read-line} (see vmlisp.lisp) to read the 
input line and returns the result, in this case, the string "1".

\begin{verbatim}
    2> (|intloopPrefix?| ")fi" "1")
    <2 (|intloopPrefix?| NIL)
    2> (|intloopPrefix?| ")" "1")
    <2 (|intloopPrefix?| NIL)
    2> (CONCAT "" "1")
    <2 (CONCAT "1")
    2> (|ncloopEscaped| "1")
    <2 (|ncloopEscaped| NIL)
\end{verbatim}

\bfref{intloopReadConsole} checks for various
possible special kinds of input. Axiom returned a non-zero length
string. Before processing it we need to check for the ``{\bf )fin}''
command, which fails. We need to check for a leading ``{\bf )}'',
meaning it is some kind of command input, which fails. We might
have an existing string in the {\bf prefix} argument so we
concatentate it to the input. The {\bf prefix} might contain
text from a previous continued line. Next we check whether the input
line has a trailing underscore, meaning an Axiom line is being
continued, and if so, we recurse in order to read the next line.

\bfref{intloopPrefix?} which will return NIL if there is no
match of the prefix characters, otherwise it returns the string
without any leading blanks.

None of these special cases occur with the input ``1''.
Axiom calls \bfref{intloopProcessString}
which calls \bfref{setCurrentLine} to add the
input line to the history which is stored in {\bf \$currentLine}.

\begin{verbatim}
    2> (|intloopProcessString| "1" 1)
      3> (|setCurrentLine| "1")
      <3 (|setCurrentLine| ("1"))
\end{verbatim}

$\cdots$all the magic happens here$\cdots$

$\cdots$ and then {\bf intloopProcessString} will eventually
return the new step number 2. Then Axiom puts up a prompt
and waits for further input.

\begin{verbatim}
    <2 (|intloopProcessString| 2)
    2> (MKPROMPT)
      3> (CONCAT "(" "2" ") -> ")
      <3 (CONCAT "(2) -> ")
    <2 (MKPROMPT "(2) -> ")
(2) -> 
    2> (|serverReadLine| #<synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*>)
      3> (IS-CONSOLE #<synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*>)
      <3 (IS-CONSOLE T)
      3> (|sockSendInt| 1 3)
      <3 (|sockSendInt| 0)
      3> (|serverSwitch|)

\end{verbatim}
Now Axiom is ready for the next input.

\section{Parsing the input}
We now examine the magic portion above which has several phases.
The first phase constructs a data structure called a Delay. This
data structure is the core data structure of the ``zipper'' parser.

The ``zipper'' parser is unique to Axiom. It was invented by Bill
Burge who did research in recursive techniques, including parsing.
For insight, see his article on Stream Procesing Functions \cite{Burg74}.

\subsection{Creating a Delay -- incString}
The \bfref{intloopProcessString} has the nested function call
\begin{verbatim}
 (|intloopProcess| n t
  (|next| #'|ncloopParse|
   (|next| #'|lineoftoks| (|incString| s))))
\end{verbatim}
which according to lisp semantics is processed inside out. First we
examine the call to \bfref{incString} which is passed the input
string ``1''.

The \bfref{incString} function gets the string from Axiom's input
line, in this case ``1'' and constructs a set of nested function calls
to process the input line.

\begin{verbatim}
      3> (|incString| "1")
\end{verbatim}

The \bfref{incString} function calls \bfref{Delay} which changes the
function call into a simple list object prefixed by the symbol tag
{\bf nonnullstream}.

\begin{verbatim}
        4> (|incLude| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
          5> (|Delay| |incLude1|  (0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)))
          <5 (|Delay| (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)))
        <4 (|incLude| (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)))
\end{verbatim}
That result is passed to \bfref{incRenumber}, which calls \bfref{incIgen}
which returns a \bfref{Delay}. It then calls \bfref{incZip} to ``zips''
together the function \bfref{incRenumberLine} and the two delays into
a single delay. This gets put into a delay with \bfref{incZip1} as the
function.
\begin{verbatim}
        4> (|incRenumber| 
               (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)))
          5> (|incIgen| 0)
            6> (|Delay| |incIgen1| (0))
            <6 (|Delay| (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))
          <5 (|incIgen| (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))

          5> (|incZip| |incRenumberLine| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                 (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))
            6> (|Delay| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine|)
            <6 (|Delay| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                   (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))
          <5 (|incZip| 
               (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                 (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))

        <4 (|incRenumber| 
              (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))

      <3 (|incString| 
           (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
             (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
             (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))
\end{verbatim}

We are building a stream of functions and arguments stored in a delay
structure which will eventually be evaluated. We continue this process
with the call to \bfref{next} which builds a delay with the function
\bfref{next1} and the current delay.

\subsection{Creating a Delay -- next}

      3> (|next| |lineoftoks|

               (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))))
      <3 (|next| 
           (|nonnullstream| |next1| |lineoftoks| 
             (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
               (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
               (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))))
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Creating a Delay -- ncloopParse}
`We continue building a larger delay, this time with a call to
\bfref{next} with the function argument \bfref{ncloopParse} and the
existing delay.

\begin{verbatim}
      3> (|next| |ncloopParse| 
           (|nonnullstream| |next1| |lineoftoks| 
             (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
               (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
               (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))))
        4> (|Delay| #0=|next1| 
             (|ncloopParse| 
               (|nonnullstream| #0# |lineoftoks| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                   (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))))
        <4 (|Delay| 
             (|nonnullstream| #0=|next1| |ncloopParse| 
               (|nonnullstream| #0# |lineoftoks| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                   (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))))
      <3 (|next| 
           (|nonnullstream| #0=|next1| |ncloopParse| 
             (|nonnullstream| #0# |lineoftoks| 
               (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                 (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))))
\end{verbatim}

Finally we call \bfref{intloopProcess} with the step number {\bf stepno},
whether we are talking to the console {\bf interactive} and the delay
we just constructed {\bf delay}

\subsection{Evaluating a Delay -- intloopProcess}

At this point we have created a large delay. Now we begin to evaluate it.

\begin{verbatim}
      3> (|intloopProcess| 1 T 
          (|nonnullstream| #0=|next1| |ncloopParse| 
            (|nonnullstream| #0# |lineoftoks| 
              (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
               (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
               (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))))
\end{verbatim}

\bfref{intloopProcess} calls \bfref{StreamNull} which walks the 
delay applying the second value, which is a function, to the rest
of the delay. Thus, all of the functions we packaged into the
delay will be evaluated.

The result of each function call, e.g the result of calling \bfref{next1}
will be a pair, which we call a ParsePair \index{ParsePair}. 
The car of the ParsePair is rplaca'd into the delay and
the cdr of the ParsePair is rplacd'd into the delay. 
So the delay is gradually reduced by each function call.

\begin{verbatim}
        4> (|StreamNull| 
             (|nonnullstream| #0=|next1| |ncloopParse| 
               (|nonnullstream| #0# |lineoftoks| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)) 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))))
\end{verbatim}

Here we see the \bfref{next1} function being called from the delay.
It immediately calls \bfref{StreamNull} to process the rest of the delay.

\begin{verbatim}
          5> (|next1| |ncloopParse| 
               (|nonnullstream| |next1| |lineoftoks| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)) 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))))
            6> (|StreamNull| 
                 (|nonnullstream| |next1| |lineoftoks| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                     (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)) 
                     (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))))
\end{verbatim}
 
\bfref{StreamNull}, now working on the inner portion of the delay,
finds the function \bfref{next1} and calls it, which results in an
immediate inner call to \bfref{StreamNull}.

\begin{verbatim}
              7> (|next1| |lineoftoks| 
                   (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                     (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)) 
                     (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))
                8> (|StreamNull| 
                     (|nonnullstream| |incZip1| |incRenumberLine| 
                       (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1)) 
                       (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0)))
\end{verbatim}

Descending even further, the \bfref{StreamNull} finds \bfref{incZip1}, 
which finds the function \bfref{incRenumberLine} and two delays.
\begin{verbatim}
                  9> (|incZip1| 
                       |incRenumberLine| 
                       (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                       (|nonnullstream| |incIgen1| 0))
\end{verbatim}
\bfref{incZip1} invokes \bfref{StreamNull} on the first delay, which
invokes \bfref{incLude1} on the rest of the delay.
\begin{verbatim}
                    10> (|StreamNull| 
                          (|nonnullstream| |incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 
                                                        ("strings") (1)))
\end{verbatim}
\bfref{incLude1} unpacks the argument list and invokes \bfref{StreamNull}
on the second argument \verb|("1")| which is not the expected symbol
{\bf nonnullstream} so \bfref{StreamNull} immediately returns NIL.
\begin{verbatim}
                    11> (|incLude1| 0 ("1") 0 ("strings") (1))
                    12> (|StreamNull| ("1"))
                    <12 (|StreamNull| NIL)
\end{verbatim}
Next, \bfref{incLude1} calls \bfref{incClassify} to which calls
\bfref{incCommand?} which checks for a leading ``)''. Since there
isn't one \bfref{incClassify} immediately returns a list of NIL, 0,
and the empty string.
\begin{verbatim}
                    12> (|incClassify| "1")
                    13> (|incCommand?| "1")
                    <13 (|incCommand?| NIL)
                    <12 (|incClassify| (NIL 0 ""))

\defunsec{set-restart-hook}{Set the restart hook}
When a lisp image containing code is reloaded there is a hook to
allow a function to be called. In our case it is the restart
function which is the entry to the Axiom interpreter.

 )

\pagehead{restart function}{The restart function}
\pagepic{ps/v5restart.ps}{Restart}{1.00}
The restart function is the real root of the world. It sets up memory
if we are working in a GCL/akcl version of the system. 

The \verb|compiler::*compile-verbose*| flag has been set to nil globally.
We do not want to know about the microsteps of GCL's compile facility.

The \verb|compiler::*suppress-compiler-warnings*| flag has been set to t.
We do not care that certain generated variables are not used.

The \verb|compiler::*suppress-compiler-notes*| flag has been set to t.
We do not care that tail recursion occurs.

It sets the
current package to be the ``BOOT'' package which is the standard
package in which the interpreter runs. 

The \fnref{initroot} function sets global variables that depend on the
AXIOM shell variable. These are needed to find basic files like s2-us.msgs,
which contains the error message text.

The \fnref{openserver} function tried to set up the socket connection
used for things like hyperdoc. The \verb|$openServerIfTrue| variable
starts true, which implies trying to start a server.

Axiom has multiple frames that contain independent information about a
computation. There can be several frames at any one time and you can 
shift back and forth between the frames. By default, the system starts
in ``frame0'' (try the \verb|)frame names| command). See the Frame
Mechanism chapter (\ref{TheFrameMechanism} page~\pageref{TheFrameMechanism}).

The \varref{printLoadMsgs} variable controls whether load messages will
be output as library routines are loaded. We disnable this by default.
It can be changed by using \verb|)set message autoload|.

The \varref{current-directory} variable is set to the current directory.
This is used by the \verb|)cd| function and some of the compile routines.

The \fnref{statisticsInitialization} function initializes variables
used to collect statistics. Currently, only the garbage collector
information is initialized.

We test {\bfref{*ThisIsARunningSystem*}}. If this variable is true
then we are restarting from a previously running system and we
do not want to reset all of the user variables.

There are several different environments used in the interpreter:

{\bf \verb|$InteractiveFrame|} is the environment where the user
values are stored.  Any side effects of evaluation of a top-level
expression are stored in this environment.  It is always used as
the starting environment for interpretation.

{\bf \$e} is the name used for \verb|$InteractiveFrame| while interpreting.

{\bf \verb|$env|} is local environment used by the interpreter.
Only temporary information (such as types of local variables is
stored in \verb|$env|. It is thrown away after evaluation of each expression.

\defdollar{e}
The \verb|$e| variable is set to the value of \verb|$InteractiveFrame|
which is set in restart to the value of the call to the
makeInitialModemapFrame function. This function simply returns a copy
of the variable \verb|$InitialModemapFrame|.

Prints out the value x which is of type m, and records the changes
in environment \verb|$e| into \verb|$InteractiveFrame|
Thus \verb|$e| is a copy of the variable \verb|$InitialModemapFrame|.

This variable is used in the undo mechanism.

\item source This is the name of a source file but appears not
to be used. It is set to the list \verb|(tim daly ?)|.
\item \verb|interactive?| If this is false then various messages are 
suppressed and input does not use piles. If this is true then the
library loading routines might output messages and piles are expected
on input (as from a file).
\end{list}
System commands are handled by the function in the ``hook''
variable \verb|$systemCommandFunction| which
has the default function \verb|InterpExecuteSpadSystemCommand|.
Thus, when a system command is entered this function is called.

\defun{cmpnote}{GCL cmpnote function}
GCL keeps noting the fact that the compiler is performing tail-recursion.
Bill Schelter added this as a debugging tool for Axiom and it was never
removed. Patching the lisp code in the GCL build fails as the system
is actually built from the pre-compiled C code. Thus, we can only step
on this message after the fact. The cmpnote function is used nowhere
else in GCL so stepping on the function call seems best. We're unhappy
with this hack and will try to convince the GCL crowd to fix this.

\section{The Read-Eval-Print Loop}
\defun{intloopReadConsole}{intloopReadConsole}
Note that this function relies on the fact that lisp can do tail-recursion.
The function recursively invokes itself.

The serverReadLine function is a special readline function that handles
communication with the session manager code, which is a separate process
running in parallel. 

We read a line from standard input.
\begin{itemize}
\item If it is a null line then we exit Axiom.
\item If it is a zero length line we prompt and recurse
\item If \$dalymode and open-paren we execute lisp code, prompt and recurse
The \$dalymode will interpret any input that begins with an open-paren
as a lisp expression rather than Axiom input. This is useful for debugging
purposes when most of the input lines will be lisp. Setting \$dalymode
non-nil will certainly break user expectations and is to be used with 
caution.
\item If it is ``)fi'' or ``)fin'' we drop into lisp. Use the (restart)
      function to return to the interpreter loop.
\item If it starts with ``)'' we process the command, prompt, and recurse
\item If it is a command then we remember the current line, process the
      command, prompt, and recurse.
\item If the input has a trailing underscore (Axiom line-continuation)
      then we cut off the continuation character and pass the truncated
      string to ourselves, prompt, and recurse
\item otherwise we process the input, prompt, and recurse.
\end{itemize}
Notice that all but two paths (a null input or a ``)fi'' or a ``)fin'')
will end up as a recursive call to ourselves.

\defun{reroot}{reroot}
The reroot function is used to reset the important variables used by
the system. In particular, these variables are sensitive to the
{\bf AXIOM} shell variable. That variable is renamed internally to
be {\bf \$spadroot}. The {\bf reroot} function will change the
system to use a new root directory and will have the same effect
as changing the {\bf AXIOM} shell variable and rerunning the system
from scratch. Note that we have changed from the
NAG distribution back to the original form. If you need the NAG
version you can push {\bf :tpd} on the {\bf *features*} variable
before compiling this file. A correct call looks like:
\begin{verbatim}
  (in-package "BOOT")
  (reroot "/spad/mnt/${SYS}")
\end{verbatim}
where the \verb|${SYS}| variable is the same one set at build time.

For the example call:
\begin{verbatim}
  (REROOT "/research/test/mnt/ubuntu")
\end{verbatim}
the variables are set as:
\begin{verbatim}
$spadroot = "/research/test/mnt/ubuntu"

\section{Functions on interpreter objects}
Interpreter objects used to be called triples because they had the
structure [value, type, environment].  For many years, the environment
was not used, so finally in January, 1990, the structure of objects
was changed to be (type . value).  This was chosen because it was the
structure of objects of type Any.  Sometimes the values are wrapped
(see the function isWrapped to see what this means physically).
Wrapped values are not actual values belonging to their types.  An
unwrapped value must be evaluated to get an actual value.  A wrapped
value must be unwrapped before being passed to a library function.
Typically, an unwrapped value in the interpreter consists of LISP
code, e.g., parts of a function that is being constructed.

These are the new structure functions.

\section{Abstract Syntax Trees Overview}

Th functions create and examine abstract syntax trees.  
These are called pforms, for short.

The pform data structure

\begin{itemize}
\item Leaves: [hd, tok, pos] where pos is optional
\item Trees:  [hd, tree, tree, ...]
\item hd is either an id or (id . alist)
\end{itemize}

The leaves are:

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
  char          &:=& ('char expr position) \\
  Document      &:=& ('Document expr position) \\
  error         &:=& ('error expr position) \\
  expression    &:=& ('expression expr position) \\
  float         &:=& ('float expr position) \\
  id            &:=& ('id expr position)\\
  idsy          &:=& ('idsy expr position)\\
  integer       &:=& ('integer expr position)\\
  string        &:=& ('string expr position)\\
  symbol        &:=& ('symbol expr position)
\end{tabular}

The special nodes:

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
  ListOf        &:=& ('listOf items)\\
  Nothing       &:=& ('nothing)\\
  SemiColon     &:=& ('SemiColon (Body: Expr))
\end{tabular}
          
The expression nodes:

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
 Add &:=& ('Add (Base: [Typed], Addin: Expr))\\ 
 And &:=& ('And left right)\\
 Application &:=& ('Application (Op: Expr, Arg: Expr))\\

 WIf &:=& ('WIf (Cond: Primary, Then: [WithPart], Else: [WithPart]))\\
 Wrong &:=& ('Wrong (Why: Document, Rubble: [Expr]))
\end{tabular}

Special cases of expression nodes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Application. The Op parameter is one of
 \verb/and, or, Y, |, {}, [], {||}, [||]/
\item DeclPart. The comment is attached to all signatutres in 
 Typing, Import, Definition, Sequence, DWhere, Macro nodes
\item EnSequence. This is either a Tuple or Sequence depending on the
argument
\item Literal. One of integer symbol expression one zero char string float
of the form ('expression expr position)
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Stream Utilities}
The input stream is parsed into a large s-expression by repeated calls
to Delay. Delay takes a function f and an argument x and returns a list
consisting of \verb|("nonnullstream" f x)|. Eventually multiple calls are made
and a large list structure is created that consists of 
\verb|("nonnullstream" f x ("nonnullstream" f1 x1 ("nonnullstream" f2 x2...|

This delay structure is given to StreamNull which walks along the
list looking at the head. If the head is ``nonnullstream'' then the
function is applied to the argument.

So, in effect, the input is ``zipped up'' into a Delay data structure
which is then evaluated by calling StreamNull. This "zippered stream"
parser was a research project at IBM and Axiom was the testbed (which
explains the strange parsing technique).

\chapter{Code Piles}
The insertpiles function converts a line-list to a line-forest where
a line is a token-dequeue and has a column which is an integer.
An A-forest is an A-tree-list
An A-tree has a root which is an A, and subtrees which is an A-forest.
 
A forest with more than one tree corresponds to a Scratchpad pile
structure (t1;t2;t3;...;tn), and a tree corresponds to a pile item.
The ( ; and ) tokens are inserted into a >1-forest, otherwise
the root of the first tree is concatenated with its forest.
column t is the number of spaces before the first non-space in line t

Immediate, Delayed, and Multiple Assignment

====================================================================
Immediate Assignment
====================================================================

A variable in Axiom refers to a value. A variable has a name beginning
with an uppercase or lowercase alphabetic character, "%", or "!".
Successive characters (if any) can be any of the above, digits, or "?".
Case is distinguished. The following are all examples of valid, distinct
variable names:

  a       tooBig?     a1B2c3%!?
  A       %j          numberOfPoints
  beta6   %J          numberofpoints

The ":=" operator is the immediate assignment operator. Use it to 
associate a value with a variable. The syntax for immediate assignment
for a single variable is:

   variable := expression

The value returned by an immediate assignment is the value of expression.

  a := 1
    1             
           Type: PositiveInteger

The right-hand side of the expression is evaluated, yielding 1. The value
is then assigned to a.

  b := a
    1             
           Type: PositiveInteger

The right-hand side of the expression is evaluated, yieldig 1. This value
is then assigned to b. Thus a and b both have the value 1 after the sequence
of assignments.

  a := 2
    2
           Type: PositiveInteger

What is the value of b if a is assigned the value 2?

  b
    1
           Type: PositiveInteger

The value of b is left unchanged.

This is what we mean when we say this kind of assignment is immediate.
The variable b has no dependency on a after the initial assignment. This
is the usual notion of assignment in programming languages such as C,
Pascal, and Fortran.

====================================================================
Delayed Assignment
====================================================================

Axiom provides delayed assignment with "==". This implements a delayed
evaluation of the right-hand side and dependency checking. The syntax for
delayed assignment is

   variable == expression

The value returned by a delayed assignment is the unique value of Void.

  a == 1
           Type: Void

  b == a
           Type: Void

Using a and b as above, these are the corresponding delayed assignments.

  a
   Compiling body of rule a to compute value of type PositiveInteger
   1
           Type: PositiveInteger

The right-hand side of each delayed assignment is left unevaluated until
the variables on the left-hand sides are evaluated. 

  b
   Compiling body of rule b to compute value of type PositiveInteger
   1
           Type: PositiveInteger

This gives the same results as before. But if we change a to 2

  a == 2
   Compiled code for a has been cleared.
   Compiled code for b has been cleared.
   1 old definition(s) deleted for function or rule a
           Type: Void

Then a evaluates to 2, as expected

  a
   Compiling body of rule a to compute value of type PositiveInteger
   2
           Type: PositiveInteger

but the value of b reflects the change to a

  b
   Compiling body of rule b to compute value of type PositiveInteger
   2
           Type: PositiveInteger

====================================================================
Multiple Immediate Assignments
====================================================================

It is possible to set several variables at the same time by using a
tuple of variables and a tuple of expressions. A tuple is a collection
of things separated by commas, often surrounded by parentheses. The
syntax for multiple immediate assignment is

 ( var1, var2, ..., varN ) := ( expr1, expr2, ..., exprN )

The value returned by an immediate assignment is the value of exprN.

 ( x, y ) := ( 1, 2 )
   2
           Type: PositiveInteger

This sets x to 1 and y to 2. Multiple immediate assignments are parallel
in the sense that the expressions on the right are all evaluated before
any assignments on the left are made. However, the order of evaluation
of these expressions is undefined.

 ( x, y ) := ( y, x )
   1
           Type: PositiveInteger

  x
   2
           Type: PositiveInteger

The variable x now has the previous value of y.

  y
   1
           Type: PositiveInteger

The variable y now has the previous value of x.

There is no syntactic form for multiple delayed assignments.

\label{blocks}

\begin{chunk}{blocks.help}
====================================================================
Blocks
====================================================================

A block is a sequence of expressions evaluated in the order that they
appear, except as modified by control expressions such as leave, return,
iterate, and if-then-else constructions. The value of a block is the
value of the expression last evaluated in the block.

To leave a block early, use "=>". For example, 

    i < 0 => x

The expression before the "=>" must evaluate to true or false. The
expression following the "=>" is the return value of the block.

A block can be constructed in two ways:

  1. the expressions can be separated by semicolons and the resulting
     expression surrounded by parentheses, and
  2. the expressions can be written on succeeding lines with each line
     indented the same number of spaces (which must be greater than zero).
     A block entered in this form is called a pile

Only the first form is available if you are entering expressions directly
to Axiom. Both forms are available in .input files. The syntax for a simple
block of expressions entered interactively is

  ( expression1 ; expression2 ; ... ; expressionN )

The value returned by a block is the value of an "=>" expression, or
expressionN if no "=>" is encountered.

In .input files, blocks can also be written in piles. The examples
given here are assumed to come from .input files.

  a := 
    i := gcd(234,672)
    i := 2*i**5 - i + 1
    1 / i

      1
    -----
    23323
              Type: Fraction Integer

In this example, we assign a rational number to a using a block consisting
of three expressions. This block is written as a pile. Each expression in
the pile has the same indentation, in this case two spaces to the right of
the first line.

  a := ( i := gcd(234,672); i := 2*i**5 - i + 1; 1 / i )

      1
    -----
    23323
              Type: Fraction Integer

Here is the same block written on one line. This is how you are required
to enter it at the input prompt.

  ( a := 1; b := 2; c := 3; [a,b,c] )
    [1,2,3]
              Type: List PositiveInteger

AAxiom gives you two ways of writing a block and the preferred way in
an .input file is to use a pile. Roughly speaking, a pile is a block
whose consituent expressions are indented the same amount. You begin a
pile by starting a new line for the first expression, indenting it to
the right of the previous line. You then enter the second expression on
a new line, vertically aligning it with the first line. And so on. If
you need to enter an inner pile, further indent its lines to the right
of the outer pile. Axiom knows where a pile ends. It ends when a subsequent
line is indented to the left of the pile or the end of the file.

Entering printable keys generally inserts new text into the buffer (unless
in overwrite mode, see below).  Other special keys can be used to modify
the text in the buffer.  In the description of the keys below, ^n means
Control-n, or holding the CONTROL key down while pressing "n".  Errors
will ring the terminal bell.

^A/^E   : Move cursor to beginning/end of the line.
^F/^B   : Move cursor forward/backward one character.
^D      : Delete the character under the cursor.
^H, DEL : Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
^K      : Kill from the cursor to the end of line.
^L      : Redraw current line.
^O      : Toggle overwrite/insert mode. Initially in insert mode. Text
          added in overwrite mode (including yanks) overwrite
          existing text, while insert mode does not overwrite.
^P/^N   : Move to previous/next item on history list.
^R/^S   : Perform incremental reverse/forward search for string on
          the history list.  Typing normal characters adds to the current
          search string and searches for a match. Typing ^R/^S marks
          the start of a new search, and moves on to the next match.
          Typing ^H or DEL deletes the last character from the search 
          string, and searches from the starting location of the last search.  
          Therefore, repeated DEL's appear to unwind to the match nearest 
          the point at which the last ^R or ^S was typed.  If DEL is 
          repeated until the search string is empty the search location 
          begins from the start of the history list.  Typing ESC or 
          any other editing character accepts the current match and 
          loads it into the buffer, terminating the search.
^T      : Toggle the characters under and to the left of the cursor.
^Y      : Yank previously killed text back at current location.  Note that
          this will overwrite or insert, depending on the current mode.
^U      : Show help (this text).
TAB     : Perform command completion based on word to the left of the cursor. 
          Words are deemed to contain only the alphanumeric and the % ! ? _  
          characters.
NL, CR  : returns current buffer to the program.

DOS and ANSI terminal arrow key sequences are recognized, and act like:

  up    : same as ^P
  down  : same as ^N
  left  : same as ^B
  right : same as ^F

====================================================================
Collection -- Creating Lists and Streams with Iterators
====================================================================

All of the loop expressions which do not use the repeat leave or
iterate words can be used to create lists and streams. For example:

This creates a simple list of the integers from 1 to 10:

  list := [i for i in 1..10]
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

Create a stream of the integers greater than or equal to 1:

  stream := [i for i in 1..]
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...]
                      Type: Stream PositiveInteger

This is a list of the prime numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive:

  [i for i in 1..10 | prime? i]
   [2,3,5,7]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

This is a stream of the prime integers greater than or equal to 1:
  
  [i for i in 1.. | prime? i]
   [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...]
                      Type: Stream PositiveInteger

This is a list of the integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, whose
squares are less than 700:

  [i for i in 1..10 while i*i < 700]
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

This is a stream of the integers greater than or equal to 1 whose
squares are less than 700:

  [i for i in 1.. while i*i < 700]
   [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...]
                      Type: Stream PositiveInteger

The general syntax of a collection is

  [ collectExpression iterator1 iterator2 ... iteratorN ]

where each iterator is either a for or a while clause. The loop 
terminates immedidately when the end test of any iterator succeeds
or when a return expression is evaluated in collectExpression. The
value returned by the collection is either a list or a stream of
elements, one for each iteration of the collectExpression.

Be careful when you use while to create a stream. By default Axiom
tries to compute and display the first ten elements of a stream. If
the while condition is not satisfied quickly, Axiom can spend a long
(potentially infinite) time trying to compute the elements. Use

  )set streams calculate 

to change the defaults to something else. This also affects the number
of terms computed and displayed for power series. For the purposes of
these examples we have use this system command to display fewer than
ten terms.

\begin{chunk}{for.help}
====================================================================
for loops
====================================================================

Axiom provide the for and in keywords in repeat loops, allowing you
to integrate across all elements of a list, or to have a variable take
on integral values from a lower bound to an upper bound. We shall refer
to these modifying clauses of repeat loops as for clauses. These clauses
can be present in addition to while clauses (See )help while). As with
all other types of repeat loops, leave (see )help leave) can be used to 
prematurely terminate evaluation of the loop.

The syntax for a simple loop using for is

  for iterator repeat loopbody

The iterator has several forms. Each form has an end test which is
evaluted before loopbody is evaluated. A for loop terminates immediately
when the end test succeeds (evaluates to true) or when a leave or return
expression is evaluated in loopbody. The value returned by the loop is 
the unique value of Void.

====================================================================
for i in n..m repeat
====================================================================

If for is followed by a variable name, the in keyword and then an integer
segment of the form n..m, the end test for this loop is the predicate 
i > m. The body of the loop is evaluated m-n+1 times if this number is
greater than 0. If this number is less than or equal to 0, the loop body
is not evaluated at all.

The variable i has the value n, n+1, ..., m for successive iterations
of the loop body. The loop variable is a local variable within the loop
body. Its value is not available outside the loop body and its value and
type within the loop body completely mask any outer definition of a
variable with the same name.

  for i in 10..12 repeat output(i**3)
   1000
   1331
   1728
                      Type: Void

The loop prints the values of 10^3, 11^3, and 12^3.

  a := [1,2,3]
   [1,2,3]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

  for i in 1..#a repeat output(a.i)
   1
   2
   3
                      Type: Void

Iterate across this list using "." to access the elements of a list
and the # operation to count its elements.

This type of iteration is applicable to anything that uses ".". You 
can also use it with functions that use indices to extract elements.

   m := matrix [ [1,2],[4,3],[9,0] ]
    +-    -+
    | 1  2 |
    | 4  3 |
    | 9  0 |
    +-    -+
                      Type: Matrix Integer

Define m to be a matrix.

   for i in 1..nrows(m) repeat output row(m.i)
    [1,2]
    [4,3]
    [9,0]
                      Type: Void

Display the rows of m.

You can iterate with for-loops.

   for i in 1..5 repeat
     if odd?(i) then iterate
     output(i)
    2
    4
                      Type: Void

Display the even integers in a segment.

====================================================================
for i in n..m by s repeat
====================================================================

By default, the difference between values taken on by a variable in
loops such as 

  for i in n..m repeat ...

is 1. It is possible to supply another, possibly negative, step value
by using the by keyword along with for and in. Like the upper and lower
bounds, the step value following the by keyword must be an integer. Note
that the loop

  for i in 1..2 by 0 repeat output(i)

will not terminate by itself, as the step value does not change the
index from its initial value of 1.

  for i in 1..5 by 2 repeat output(i)
   1
   3
   5
                      Type: Void

This expression displays the odd integers between two bounds.

  for i in 5..1 by -2 repeat output(i)
   5
   3
   1
                      Type: Void

Use this to display the numbers in reverse order.

====================================================================
for i in n.. repeat
====================================================================

If the value after the ".." is omitted, the loop has no end test. A
potentially infinite loop is thus created. The variable is given the
successive values n, n+1, n+2, ... and the loop is terminated only
if a leave or return expression is evaluated in the loop body. However,
you may also add some other modifying clause on the repeat, for example,
a while clause, to stop the loop.

  for i in 15.. while not prime?(i) repeat output(i)
   15
   16
                      Type: Void

This loop displays the integers greater than or equal to 15 and less
than the first prime number greater than 15.

====================================================================
for x in l repeat
====================================================================

Another variant of the for loop has the form:

  for x in list repeat loopbody

This form is used when you want to iterate directly over the elements
of a list. In this form of the for loop, the variable x takes on the
value of each successive element in l. The end test is most simply
stated in English: "are there no more x in l?"

  l := [0, -5, 3]
   [0, -5, 3]
                      Type: List Integer

  for x in l repeat output(x)
   0
   -5
   3
                      Type: Void

This displays all of the elements of the list l, one per line.

Since the list constructing expression 

  expand [n..m]

creates the list

  [n, n+1, ..., m]

you might be tempted to think that the loops

  for i in n..m repeat output(i)

and

  for x in expand [n..m] repeat output(x)

are equivalent. The second form first creates the expanded list
(no matter how large it might be) and then does the iteration. The
first form potentially runs in much less space, as the index variable
i is simply incremented once per loop and the list is not actually
created. Using the first form is much more efficient.

Of course, sometimes you really want to iterate across a specific list.
This displays each of the factors of 2400000:

  for f in factors(factor(2400000)) repeat output(f)
   [factor= 2, exponent= 8]
   [factor= 3, exponent= 1]
   [factor= 5, exponent= 5]
                      Type: Void

\end{chunk}

\section{syntax if}
\label{if}
\index{if}
\index{syntax!if}
\index{if!syntax}
\begin{chunk}{if.help}
====================================================================
If-then-else
====================================================================

Like many other programming languages, Axiom uses the three keywords
if, then, and else to form conditional expressions. The else part of
the conditional is optional. The expression between the if and then
keywords is a predicate: an expression that evaluates to or is
convertible to either true or false, that is, a Boolean.

The syntax for conditional expressions is

   if predicate then expression1 else expression2

where the "else expression2" part is optional. The value returned from
a conditional expression is expression1 if the predicate evaluates to
true and expression2 otherwise. If no else clause is given, the value
is always the unique value of Void.

An if-then-else expression always returns a value. If the else clause
is missing then the entire expression returns the unique value of Void.
If both clauses are present, the type of the value returned by if is
obtained by resolving the types of the values of the two clauses.

The predicate must evaluate to, or be convertible to, an object of type
Boolean: true or false. By default, the equal sign "=" creates an equation.

   x + 1 = y
    x + 1 = y
                Type: Equation Polynomial Integer

This is an equation, not a boolean condition. In particular, it is
an object of type Equation Polynomial Integer.

However, for predicates in if expressions, Axiom places a default 
target type of Boolean on the predicate and equality testing is performed.
Thus you need not qualify the "=" in any way. In other contexts you may
need to tell Axiom that you want to test for equality rather than create
an equation. In these cases, use "@" and a target type of Boolean.

The compound symbol meaning "not equal" in Axiom is "~=". This can be
used directly without a package call or a target specification. The
expression "a ~= b" is directly translated to "not(a = b)".

Many other functions have return values of type Boolean. These include
<, <=, >, >=, ~=, and member?. By convention, operations with names
ending in "?" return Boolean values.

The usual rules for piles are suspended for conditional expressions. In
.input files, the then and else keywords can begin in the same column
as the corresponding if by may also appear to the right. Each of the
following styles of writing if-then-else expressions is acceptable:

  if i>0 then output("positive") else output("nonpositive")

  if i>0 then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

  if i>0 then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

  if i>0 
  then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

  if i>0 
    then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

A block can follow the then or else keywords. In the following two 
assignments to a, the then and else clauses each are followed by two
line piles. The value returned in each is the value of the second line.

  a :=
    if i > 0 then
      j := sin(i * pi())
      exp(j + 1/j)
    else
      j := cos(i * 0.5 * pi())
      log(abs(j)**5 + i)


  a :=
    if i > 0 
      then
        j := sin(i * pi())
        exp(j + 1/j)
      else
        j := cos(i * 0.5 * pi())
        log(abs(j)**5 + i)

These are both equivalent to the following:

  a := 
    if i > 0 then (j := sin(i * pi()); exp(j + 1/j))
    else (j := cos(i * 0.5 * pi()); log(abs(j)**5 + i))

====================================================================
leave in loops
====================================================================

The leave keyword is often more useful in terminating a loop. A
leave causes control to transfer to the expression immediately following
the loop. As loops always return the unique value of Void, you cannot
return a value with leave. That is, leave takes no argument.

  f() ==
    i := 1
    repeat
      if factorial(i) > 1000 then leave
      i := i + 1
    i
                      Type: Void

This example is a modification of the last example in the previous
section. Instead of using return we'll use leave.

  f()
   7
                      Type: PositiveInteger

The loop terminates when factorial(i) gets big enough. The last line
of the function evaluates to the corresponding "good" value of i
and the function terminates, returning that value.

You can only use leave to terminate the evaluation of one loop. Lets
consider a loop within a loop, that is, a loop with a nested loop. 
First, we initialize two counter variables.

  (i,j) := (1,1)
   1
                      Type: PositiveInteger

  repeat
    repeat
      if (i + j) > 10 then leave
      j := j + 1
    if (i + j) > 10 then leave
    i := i + 1
                      Type: Void

Nested loops must have multiple leave expressions at the appropriate
nesting level. How would you rewrite this so (i + j) > 10 is only
evaluated once?

====================================================================
leave vs => in loop bodies
====================================================================

Compare the following two loops:

  i := 1                      i := 1
  repeat                      repeat
    i := i + 1                  i := i + 1
    i > 3 => i                  if i > 3 then leave
    output(i)                   output(i)

In the example on the left, the values 2 and 3 for i are displayed but
then the "=>" does not allow control to reach the call to output again.
The loop will not terminate until you run out of space or interrupt the
execution. The variable i will continue to be incremented because the
"=>" only means to leave the block, not the loop.

In the example on the right, upon reaching 4, the leave will be executed,
and both the block and the loop will terminate. This is one of the reasons
why both "=>" and leave are provided. Using a while clase with the "=>"
lets you simulate the action of leave.

====================================================================
parallel iteration
====================================================================

Sometimes you want to iterate across two lists in parallel, or perhaps
you want to traverse a list while incrementing a variable.

The general syntax of a repeat loop is

 iterator1, iterator2, ..., iteratorN repeat loopbody

where each iterator is either a for or a while clause. The loop 
terminates immediately when the end test of any iterator succeeds or 
when a leave or return expression is evaluated in loopbody. The value
returned by the loop is the unique value of Void.

  l := [1,3,5,7]
   [1,3,5,7]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

  m := [100,200]
   [100,200]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

  sum := 0
   0
                      Type: NonNegativeInteger

Here we write a loop to iterate across two lists, computing the sum
of the pairwise product of the elements:

  for x in l for y in m repeat
    sum := sum + x*y
                      Type: Void

The last two elements of l are not used in the calculation because
m has two fewer elements than l.

  sum
   700
                      Type: NonNegativeInteger

This is the "dot product".

Next we write a loop to compute the sum of the products of the loop
elements with their positions in the loop.

  l := [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]
   [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]
                      Type: List PositiveInteger

  sum := 0
   0
                      Type: NonNegativeInteger

  for i in 0.. for x in l repeat sum := i * x
                      Type: Void

Here looping stops when the list l is exhaused, even though the
for i in 0.. specifies no terminating condition.

  sum 
   407
                      Type: NonNegativeInteger

When "|" is used to qualify any of the for clauses in a parallel 
iteration, the variables in the predicates can be from an outer
scope or from a for clause in or to the left of the modified clause.

This is correct:
 
  for i in 1..10 repeat
    for j in 200..300 | ood? (i+j) repeat
      output [i,j]

But this is not correct. The variable j has not been defined outside
the inner loop:

  for i in 1..01 | odd? (i+j) repeat -- wrong, j not defined
    for j in 200..300 repeat
      output [i,j]

It is possible to mix several of repeat modifying clauses on a loop:

  for i in 1..10
    for j in 151..160 | odd? j
      while i + j < 160 repeat
        output [i,j]
   [1,151]
   [3,153]
                      Type: Void

Here are useful rules for composing loop expressions:

 1. while predicates can only refer to variables that are global (or
    in an outer scope) or that are defined in for clauses to the left
    of the predicate.
 2. A "such that" predicate (somthing following "|") must directly
    follow a for clause and can only refer to variables that are
    global (or in an outer scope) or defined in the modified for clause
    or any for clause to the left.

\begin{chunk}{repeat.help}
====================================================================
Repeat Loops
====================================================================

A loop is an expression that contains another expression, called the loop
body, which is to be evaluated zero or more times. All loops contain the
repeat keyword and return the unique value of Void. Loops can contain
inner loops to any depth.

The most basic loop is of the form
 
  repeat loopbody

Unless loopbody contains a leave or return expression, the loop repeats
foreer. The value returned by the loop is the unique value of Void.

Axiom tries to determine completely the type of every object in a loop
and then to translate the loop body to Lisp or even to machine code. This
translation is called compilation.

If Axiom decides that it cannot compile the loop, it issues a message
stating the problem and then the following message:

  We will attemp to step through and interpret the code

It is still possible that Axiom can evalute the loop but in interpret-code
mode.

====================================================================
Return in Loops
====================================================================

A return expression is used to exit a function with a particular value.
In particular, if a return is in a loop within the function, the loop
is terminated whenever the return is evaluated. 

  f() ==
    i := 1
    repeat
      if factorial(i) > 1000 then return i
      i := i + 1
                      Type: Void

  f()
                      Type: Void

When factorial(i) is big enough, control passes from inside the loop
all the way outside the function, returning the value of i (so we think).
What went wrong? Isn't it obvious that this function should return an
integer? Well, Axiom makes no attempt to analyze the structure of a
loop to determine if it always returns a value because, in general, this
is impossible. So Axiom has this simple rule: the type of the function is
determined by the type of its body, in this case a block. The normal value
of a block is the value of its last expression, in this case, a loop. And
the value of every loop is the unique value of Void. So the return type
of f is Void.

There are two ways to fix this. The best way is for you to tell Axiom
what the return type of f is. You do this by giving f a declaration

   f:() -> Integer

prior to calling for its value. This tells Axiom "trust me -- an integer
is returned". Another way is to add a dummy expression as follows.

  f() ==
    i := 1
    repeat
      if factorial(i) > 1000 then return i
      i := i + 1
    0
                      Type: Void

Note that the dummy expression will never be evaluated but it is the
last expression in the function and will determine the return type.

  f()
   7
                      Type: PositiveInteger

====================================================================
leave in loops
====================================================================

The leave keyword is often more useful in terminating a loop. A
leave causes control to transfer to the expression immediately following
the loop. As loops always return the unique value of Void, you cannot
return a value with leave. That is, leave takes no argument.

  f() ==
    i := 1
    repeat
      if factorial(i) > 1000 then leave
      i := i + 1
    i
                      Type: Void

This example is a modification of the last example in the previous
section. Instead of using return we'll use leave.

  f()
   7
                      Type: PositiveInteger

The loop terminates when factorial(i) gets big enough. The last line
of the function evaluates to the corresponding "good" value of i
and the function terminates, returning that value.

You can only use leave to terminate the evaluation of one loop. Lets

  (i,j) := (1,1)

      if (i + j) > 10 then leave
      j := j + 1
    if (i + j) > 10 then leave
    i := i + 1
                      Type: Void

Nested loops must have multiple leave expressions at the appropriate
nesting level. How would you rewrite this so (i + j) > 10 is only
evaluated once?

====================================================================
leave vs => in loop bodies
====================================================================

Compare the following two loops:

  i := 1                      i := 1
  repeat                      repeat
    i := i + 1                  i := i + 1
    i > 3 => i                  if i > 3 then leave
    output(i)                   output(i)

In the example on the left, the values 2 and 3 for i are displayed but
then the "=>" does not allow control to reach the call to output again.
The loop will not terminate until you run out of space or interrupt the
execution. The variable i will continue to be incremented because the
"=>" only means to leave the block, not the loop.

and both the block and the loop will terminate. This is one of the reasons
why both "=>" and leave are provided. Using a while clase with the "=>"
lets you simulate the action of leave.

====================================================================
iterate in loops
====================================================================

Axiom provides an iterate expression that skips over the remainder
of a loop body and starts the next loop execution. We first initialize
a counter.

  i := 0
   0
                      Type: NonNegativeInteger

Display the even integers from 2 to 5:

  repeat
    i := i + 1
    if i > 5 then leave
    if odd?(i) then iterate
    output(i)
   2
   4
                      Type: Void

====================================================================
Such that predicates
====================================================================

A for loop can be followed by a "|" and then a predicate. The predicate
qualifies the use of the values from the iterator that follows the for.
Think of the vertical bar "|" as the phrase "such that".

  for n in 0..4 | odd? n repeat output n
   1
   3
                      Type: Void

This loop expression prints out the integers n in the given segment
such that n is odd.

A for loop can also be written

  for iterator | predicate repeat loopbody

which is equivalent to:

  for iterator repeat if predicate then loopbody else iterate

The predicate need not refer only to the variable in the for clause.
Any variable in an outer scope can be part of the predicate.

  for i in 1..50 repeat
    for j in 1..50 | factorial(i+j) < 25 repeat
      output [i,j]

while loops
====================================================================

The repeat in a loop can be modified by adding one or more while 
clauses. Each clause contains a predicate immediately following the
while keyword. The predicate is tested before the evaluation of the 
body of the loop. The loop body is evaluated whenever the predicate
in a while clause is true.

The syntax for a simple loop using while is

  while predicate repeat loopbody

The predicate is evaluated before loopbody is evaluated. A while loop
terminates immediately when predicate evaluates to false or when a
leave or return expression is evaluted. See )help repeat for more
information on leave and return.

Here is a simple example of using while in a loop. We first initialize
the counter.

  i := 1
   1
                      Type: PositiveInteger

  while i < 1 repeat
    output "hello"
    i := i + 1
                      Type: Void

The steps involved in computing this example are
 (1) set i to 1
 (2) test the condition i < 1 and determine that it is not true
 (3) do not evaluate the loop body and therefore do not display "hello"

  (x, y) := (1, 1)
   1
                      Type: PositiveInteger

If you have multiple predicates to be tested use the logical and
operation to separate them. Axiom evaluates these predicates from
left to right.

  while x < 4 and y < 10 repeat
    output [x,y]
    x := x + 1
    y := y + 2
   [1,1]
   [2,3]
   [3,5]
                      Type: Void


A leave expression can be included in a loop body to terminate a loop
even if the predicate in any while clauses are not false.

  (x, y) := (1, 1)
   1
                      Type: PositiveInteger

  while x < 4 and y < 10 repeat
    if x + y > 7 then leave
    output [x,y]
    x := x + 1
    y := y + 2
   [1,1]
   [2,3]
                      Type: Void

\chapter{Function Selection}
\begin{verbatim}
New Selection of Modemaps

selection of applicable modemaps is done in two steps:
  first it tries to find a modemap inside an argument domain, and if
  this fails, by evaluation of pattern modemaps
the result is a list of functions with signatures, which have the
  following form:
  [sig,elt,cond] where
    sig is the signature gained by evaluating the modemap condition
    elt is the slot number to get the implementation
    cond are runtime checks which are the results of evaluating the
    modemap condition

the following flags are used:
 $Coerce is NIL, if function selection is done which requires exact
   matches (e.g. for coercion functions)
 if $SubDom is true, then runtime checks have to be compiled

The isPartialMode function tests whether m contains \verb|$EmptyMode|. The
constant \verb|$EmptyMode| evaluates to \verb?|$EmptyMode|?. This constant

complete.

\chapter{Coercions}

\begin{verbatim}
 main algorithms for canCoerceFrom and coerceInteractive

coerceInteractive and canCoerceFrom are the two coercion functions
for $InteractiveMode. They translate RN, RF and RR to QF I, QF P
and RE RN, respectively, and call coerceInt or canCoerce, which
both work in the same way (e.g. coercion from t1 to t2):
1. they try to coerce t1 to t2 directly (tower coercion), and, if
  this fails, to coerce t1 to the last argument of t2 and embed
  this last argument into t2. These embedding functions are now only
  defined in the algebra code. (RSS 2-27-87)
2. the tower coercion looks whether there is any applicable local
  coercion, which means, one defined in boot or in algebra code.
  If there is an applicable function from a constructor, which is
  inside the type tower of t1, to the top level constructor of t2,
  then this constructor is bubbled up inside t1. This means,
  special coercion functions (defined in boot) are called, which
  commute two constructors in a tower. Then the local coercion is
  called on these constructors, which both are on top level now.
example:
let t1 = A B C D E (short for (A (B (C (D (E))))), where A ... E are
  type constructors), and t2 = F D G H I J
there is no coercion from t1 to t2 directly, so we try to coerce
  t1 to s1 = D G H I J, the last argument of t2
we create the type s2 = A D B C E and call a local coercion A2A
  from t1 to s2, which, by recursively calling coerce, bubbles up
  the constructor D
then we call a commute coerce from s2 to s3 = D A B C E and a local
  coerce D2D from s3 to s1
finally we embed s1 into t2, which completes the coercion t1 to t2
the result of canCoerceFrom is TRUE or NIL
the result of coerceInteractive is a object or NIL (=failed)
all boot coercion functions have the following result:
1. if u=$fromCoerceable$, then TRUE or NIL
2. if the coercion succeeds, the coerced value (this may be NIL)
3. if the coercion fails, they throw to a catch point in
     coerceByFunction

\chapter{System Command Handling}
The system commands are the top-level commands available in Axiom
that can all be invoked by prefixing the symbol with a closed-paren. 
Thus, to see they copyright you type:
\begin{verbatim}
   )copyright
\end{verbatim}
New commands need to be added to this table. The command invoked will
be the first entry of the pair and the ``user level'' of the command
will be the second entry.

\section{Functions}
\defun{handleNoParseCommands}{handleNoParseCommands}
The system commands given by the global variable
\verb|$noParseCommands| require essentially no preprocessing/parsing
of their arguments. Here we dispatch the functions which implement
these commands.

There are four standard commands which receive arguments
\begin{itemize}
\item boot
\item lisp
\item synonym 
\item system
\end{itemize}

There are six standard commands which do not receive arguments -- 
\begin{itemize}
\item quit
\item fin
\item pquit
\item credits
\item copyright
\item trademark
\end{itemize}

As these commands do not necessarily
exhaust those mentioned in \verb|$noParseCommands|, we provide a
generic dispatch based on two conventions: commands which do not
require an argument name themselves, those which do have their names

A.2.  )abbreviation
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  compiler
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )abbreviation query  [nameOrAbbrev]
  -  )abbreviation category  abbrev  fullname [)quiet]
  -  )abbreviation domain  abbrev  fullname   [)quiet]
  -  )abbreviation package  abbrev  fullname  [)quiet]
  -  )abbreviation remove  nameOrAbbrev
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to query, set and remove abbreviations for category,
domain and package constructors. Every constructor must have a unique
abbreviation. This abbreviation is part of the name of the subdirectory under
which the components of the compiled constructor are stored. Furthermore, by
issuing this command you let the system know what file to load automatically
if you use a new constructor. Abbreviations must start with a letter and then
be followed by up to seven letters or digits. Any letters appearing in the
abbreviation must be in uppercase.
 
When used with the query argument, this command may be used to list the name
associated with a particular abbreviation or the abbreviation for a
constructor. If no abbreviation or name is given, the names and corresponding
abbreviations for all constructors are listed.
 
The following shows the abbreviation for the constructor List:
 
)abbreviation query List
 
The following shows the constructor name corresponding to the abbreviation
NNI:
 
)abbreviation query NNI
 
The following lists all constructor names and their abbreviations.
 
)abbreviation query
 
To add an abbreviation for a constructor, use this command with category,
domain or package. The following add abbreviations to the system for a
category, domain and package, respectively:
 
)abbreviation domain   SET Set
)abbreviation category COMPCAT  ComplexCategory
)abbreviation package  LIST2MAP ListToMap
 
If the )quiet option is used, no output is displayed from this command. You
would normally only define an abbreviation in a library source file. If this
command is issued for a constructor that has already been loaded, the
constructor will be reloaded next time it is referenced. In particular, you
can use this command to force the automatic reloading of constructors.
 
To remove an abbreviation, the remove argument is used. This is usually only
used to correct a previous command that set an abbreviation for a constructor
name. If, in fact, the abbreviation does exist, you are prompted for
confirmation of the removal request. Either of the following commands will
remove the abbreviation VECTOR2 and the constructor name VectorFunctions2
from the system:
 
)abbreviation remove VECTOR2
)abbreviation remove VectorFunctions2

User Level Required: development

Command Syntax:

  )browse

Command Description:

This command is used by Axiom system users to start the Axiom top level
loop listening for browser connections.

\end{chunk}
\section{Overview}
The Axiom book on the help browser is a complete rewrite of the 
hyperdoc mechanism. There are several components that were needed
to make this function. Most of the web browser components are
described in bookvol11.pamphlet. This portion describes some of
the design issues needed to support the interface.

The axServer command takes a port (defaulting to 8085) and a
program to handle the browser interaction (defaulting to multiServ).
The axServer function opens the port, constructs the stream, and
passes the stream to multiServ. The multiServ loop processes one
interaction at a time.

So the basic process is that the Axiom ``)browse'' command opens a
socket and listens for http requests. Based on the type of request
(either 'GET' or 'POST') and the content of the request, which is
one of:
\begin{itemize}
\item command - algebra request/response
\item lispcall - a lisp s-expression to be evaluated
\item showcall - an Axiom )show command
\end{itemize}
the multiServ function will call a handler function to evaluate
the command line and construct a response. GET requests result
in a new browser page. POST requests result in an inline result.

Most responses contain the fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item stepnum - this is the Axiom step number 
\item command - this is the original command from the browser
\item algebra - this is the Axiom 2D algebra output
\item mathml - this is the MathML version of the Axiom algebra
\item type - this is the type of the Axiom result
\end{itemize}

\section{Browsers, MathML, and Fonts}
This work has the Firefox browser as its target. Firefox has built-in
support for MathML, javascript, and XMLHttpRequests. More details
are available in bookvol11.pamphlet but the very basic machinery for 
communication with the browser involves a dance between the browser
and the multiServ function (see the axserver.spad.pamphlet). 

In particular, a simple request is embedded in a web page as:
\begin{verbatim}
<ul>
 <li>
  <input type="submit" id="p3" class="subbut" 
    onclick="makeRequest('p3');"
    value="sin(x)" />
  <div id="ansp3"><div></div></div>
 </li>
</ul>
\end{verbatim}
which says that this is an html ``input'' field of type ``submit''.
The CSS display class is ``subbut'' which is of a different color
than the surrounding text to make it obvious that you can click on
this field. Clickable fields that have no response text are of class
``noresult''.

The javascript call to ``makeRequest'' gives the ``id'' of this input
field, which must be unique in the page, as an argument. In this case,
the argument is 'p3'. The ``value'' field holds the display text which
will be passed back to Axiom as a command.

When the result arrives the ``showanswer'' function will select out
the mathml field of the response, construct the ``id'' of the html
div to hold the response by concatenating the string ``ans'' (answer)
to the ``id'' of the request resulting, in this case, as ``ansp3''.
The ``showanswer'' function will find this div and replace it with a
div containing the mathml result.

The ``makeRequest'' function is:
\begin{verbatim}
 function makeRequest(arg) {
   http_request = new XMLHttpRequest();         
   var command = commandline(arg);
   //alert(command);
   http_request.open('POST', '127.0.0.1:8085', true);
   http_request.onreadystatechange = handleResponse;
   http_request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
   http_request.send("command="+command);
   return(false);
\end{verbatim}
It contains a request to open a local server connection to Axiom,
sets ``handleResponse'' as the function to call on reply, sets up
the type of request, fills in the command field, and sends off the
http request.

When a response is received, the ``handleResponse'' function checks
for the correct reply state, strips out the important text, and
calls ``showanswer''.
\begin{verbatim}
 function handleResponse() {
  if (http_request.readyState == 4) {
   if (http_request.status == 200) {
    showanswer(http_request.responseText,'mathAns');
   } else
   {
     alert('There was a problem with the request.'+ http_request.statusText);
   }
  }
 }
\end{verbatim}
See bookvol11.pamphlet for further details.

\section{The axServer/multiServ loop}
The basic call to start an Axiom browser listener is:
\begin{verbatim}
  )set message autoload off
  )set output mathml on
  axServer(8085,multiServ)$AXSERV
\end{verbatim}

This call sets the port, opens a socket, attaches it to a stream,
and then calls ``multiServ'' with that stream. The ``multiServ''
function loops serving web responses to that port.

\section{\enspace{}The )browse command}
In order to make the whole process cleaner the function ``)browse''
handles the details. This code creates the command-line function for )browse

The browse function does the internal equivalent of the following 3 command
line statments:
\begin{verbatim}
  )set message autoload off
  )set output mathml on
  axServer(8085,multiServ)$AXSERV
\end{verbatim}
which causes Axiom to start serving web pages on port 8085

For those unfamiliar with calling algebra from lisp there are a 
few points to mention. 

The loadLib needs to be called to load the algebra code into the image.
Normally this is automatic but we are not using the interpreter so
we need to do this ``by hand''.

Each algebra file contains a "constructor function" which builds the
domain, which is a vector, and then caches the vector so that every
call to the contructor returns an EQ vector, that is, the same vector.
In this case, we call the constructor $\vert$AxiomServer$\vert$

The axServer function was mangled internally to 
$\vert$AXSERV;axServer;IMV;2$\vert$.
The multiServ function was mangled to $\vert$AXSERV;multiServ;SeV;3$\vert$
Note well that if you change axserver.spad these names might change
which will generate the error message along the lines of:
\begin{verbatim}
    System error:
    The function $\vert$AXSERV;axServer;IMV;2$\vert$ is undefined.
\end{verbatim}

To fix this you need to look at int/algebra/AXSERV.nrlib/code.lsp
and find the new mangled function name. A better solution would
be to dynamically look up the surface names in the domain vector.

Each Axiom function expects the domain vector as the last argument.
This is not obvious from the call as the interpreter supplies it.
We must do that ``by hand''.

We don't call the multiServ function. We pass it as a parameter to
the axServer function. When it does get called by the SPADCALL
macro it needs to be a lisp pair whose car is the function and
whose cdr is the domain vector. We construct that pair here as
the second argument to axServer. The third, hidden, argument to
axServer is the domain vector which we supply ``by hand''.

The socket can be supplied on the command line but defaults to 8085.
Axiom supplies the arguments as a list.

\calls{browse}{set}
\calls{browse}{loadLib}
\calls{browse}{AxiomServer}
\calls{browse}{AXSERV;axServer;IMV;2}
\begin{chunk}{defun browse}
(defun |browse| (socket)
 (let (axserv browser)
  (if socket 
    (setq socket (car socket))
    (setq socket 8085))
  (|set| '(|mes| |auto| |off|))
  (|set| '(|out| |mathml| |on|))
  (|loadLib| '|AxiomServer|)
  (setq axserv (|AxiomServer|))
  (setq browser 
   (|AXSERV;axServer;IMV;2| socket
    (cons #'|AXSERV;multiServ;SeV;3| axserv) axserv))))

\end{chunk}
Now we have to bolt it into Axiom. This involves two lookups.

We create the lisp pair 
\begin{verbatim}
  (|browse| . |development|)
\end{verbatim} 
and cons it into the \$systemCommands command table.  This allows the
command to be executed in development mode.  This lookup decides if
this command is allowed. It also has the side-effect of putting the
command into the \$SYSCOMMANDS variable which is used to determine
if the token is a command.

====================================================================
A.4.  )cd
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )cd directory
 
Command Description: 
 
This command sets the AXIOM working current directory. The current directory
is used for looking for input files (for )read), AXIOM library source files
(for )compile), saved history environment files (for )history )restore),
compiled AXIOM library files (for )library), and files to edit (for )edit).
It is also used for writing spool files (via )spool), writing history input
files (via )history )write) and history environment files (via )history
)save),and compiled AXIOM library files (via )compile).
 
If issued with no argument, this command sets the AXIOM current directory to
your home directory. If an argument is used, it must be a valid directory
name. Except for the ``)'' at the beginning of the command, this has the same
syntax as the operating system cd command.

A.6.  )clear
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )clear all
  - )clear completely
  - )clear properties all
  - )clear properties  obj1 [obj2 ...]
  - )clear value      all
  - )clear value     obj1 [obj2 ...]
  - )clear mode       all
  - )clear mode      obj1 [obj2 ...]
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to remove function and variable declarations,
definitions and values from the workspace. To empty the entire workspace and
reset the step counter to 1, issue
 
)clear all
 
To remove everything in the workspace but not reset the step counter, issue
 
)clear properties all
 
To remove everything about the object x, issue
 
)clear properties x
 
To remove everything about the objects x, y and f, issue
 
)clear properties x y f
 
The word properties may be abbreviated to the single letter ``p''.
 
)clear p all
)clear p x
)clear p x y f
 
All definitions of functions and values of variables may be removed by either
 
)clear value all
)clear v all
 
This retains whatever declarations the objects had. To remove definitions and
values for the specific objects x, y and f, issue
 
)clear value x y f
)clear v x y f
 
To remove the declarations of everything while leaving the definitions and
values, issue
 
)clear mode  all
)clear m all
 
To remove declarations for the specific objects x, y and f, issue
 
)clear mode x y f
)clear m x y f
 
The )display names and )display properties commands may be used to see what
is currently in the workspace.
 
The command
 
)clear completely
 
does everything that )clear all does, and also clears the internal system
function and constructor caches.

====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )close
  - )close )quietly
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to close down interpreter client processes. Such
processes are started by HyperDoc to run AXIOM examples when you click on
their text. When you have finished examining or modifying the example and you
do not want the extra window around anymore, issue
 
)close
 
to the AXIOM prompt in the window.
 
If you try to close down the last remaining interpreter client process, AXIOM
will offer to close down the entire AXIOM session and return you to the
operating system by displaying something like
 
   This is the last AXIOM session. Do you want to kill AXIOM?
 
Type "y" (followed by the Return key) if this is what you had in mind. Type
"n" (followed by the Return key) to cancel the command.
 
You can use the )quietly option to force AXIOM to close down the interpreter
client process without closing down the entire AXIOM session.

)compile mycode )nolibrary
 
By default, the )library system command exposes all domains and categories it
processes. This means that the AXIOM intepreter will consider those domains
and categories when it is trying to resolve a reference to a function.
Sometimes domains and categories should not be exposed. For example, a domain
may just be used privately by another domain and may not be meant for
top-level use. The )library command should still be used, though, so that the
code will be loaded on demand. In this case, you should use the )nolibrary
option on )compile and the )noexpose option in the )library command. For
example,
 
)compile mycode.spad )nolibrary
)library mycode )noexpose
 
Once you have established your own collection of compiled code, you may find
it handy to use the )dir option on the )library command. This causes )library
to process all compiled code in the specified directory. For example,
 
)library )dir /u/jones/as/quantum
 
You must give an explicit directory after )dir, even if you want all compiled
code in the current working directory processed.
 
)library )dir .
 
You can compile category, domain, and package constructors contained in files
with file extension .spad. You can compile individual constructors or every
constructor in a file.
 
The full filename is remembered between invocations of this command and )edit
commands. The sequence of commands
 
)compile matrix.spad
)edit
)compile
 
will call the compiler, edit, and then call the compiler again on the file
matrix.spad. If you do not specify a directory, the working current directory
(see description of command )cd ) is searched for the file. If the file is
not found, the standard system directories are searched.
 
If you do not give any options, all constructors within a file are compiled.
Each constructor should have an )abbreviation command in the file in which it
is defined. We suggest that you place the )abbreviation commands at the top
of the file in the order in which the constructors are defined. The list of
commands serves as a table of contents for the file.
 
The )library option causes directories containing the compiled code for each
constructor to be created in the working current directory. The name of such
a directory consists of the constructor abbreviation and the .NRLIB file
extension. For example, the directory containing the compiled code for the
MATRIX constructor is called MATRIX.NRLIB. The )nolibrary option says that
such files should not be created. 
 
The )vartrace option causes the compiler to generate extra code for the
constructor to support conditional tracing of variable assignments. (see
description of command )trace ). Without this option, this code is suppressed
and one cannot use the )vars option for the trace command.
 
The )constructor option is used to specify a particular constructor to
compile. All other constructors in the file are ignored. The constructor name
or abbreviation follows )constructor. Thus either
 
)compile matrix.spad )constructor RectangularMatrix
 
or
 
)compile matrix.spad )constructor RMATRIX
 
compiles the RectangularMatrix constructor defined in matrix.spad.
 
The )break and )nobreak options determine what the compiler does
when it encounters an error. )break is the default and it indicates that
processing should stop at the first error. The value of the )set break
variable then controls what happens.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to display the comments for the operation, category,
domain or package. The comments are part of the algebra source code.
 
The commands
 
)describe <categoryName> [internal]
)describe <domainName>   [internal]
)describe <packageName>  [internal]
 
will show a properly formatted version of the "Description:" keyword
from the comments in the algebra source for the category, domain,
or package requested. 

If 'internal' is requested, then the internal format of the domain or 
package is described. Categories do not have an internal representation.

This trivial function satisfies the standard pattern of making a
user command match the name of the function which implements the

\defun{describeSpad2Cmd}{describeSpad2Cmd}
The describe command prints cleaned-up comment strings from the algebra
libraries. It can print strings associated with a category, domain, package,
or by operation.

This implements command line options of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
  )describe categoryName [internal]
  )describe domainName   [internal]
  )describe packageName  [internal]
\end{verbatim}
The describeInternal function will either call the ``dc'' function
to describe the internal representation of the argument or it will
print a cleaned up version of the text for the "Description" keyword
in the Category, Domain, or Package source code.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to display the contents of the workspace and signatures
of functions with a given name. (A signature gives the argument and return
types of a function.) 
 
The command
 
)display names
 
lists the names of all user-defined objects in the workspace. This is useful
if you do not wish to see everything about the objects and need only be
reminded of their names.
 
The commands
 
)display all
)display properties
)display properties all
 
all do the same thing: show the values and types and declared modes of all
variables in the workspace. If you have defined functions, their signatures
and definitions will also be displayed.
 
To show all information about a particular variable or user functions, for
example, something named d, issue
 
)display properties d
 
To just show the value (and the type) of d, issue
 
)display value d
 
To just show the declared mode of d, issue
 
)display mode d
 
All modemaps for a given operation may be displayed by using )display
operations. A modemap is a collection of information about a particular
reference to an operation. This includes the types of the arguments and the
return value, the location of the implementation and any conditions on the
types. The modemap may contain patterns. The following displays the modemaps
for the operation FromcomplexComplexCategory:

This trivial function satisfies the standard pattern of making a
user command match the name of the function which implements the
command. That command immediatly invokes a ``Spad2Cmd'' version.

\subsection{displaySpad2Cmd}
We process the options to the command and call the appropriate
display function. There are really only 4 display functions.
All of the other options are just subcases.

There is a slight mismatch between the \$displayOptions list of
symbols and the options this command accepts so we have a cond
branch to clean up the option variable. This allows for the options
to be plural.

If we fall all the way thru we use the \$displayOptions list
to construct a list of strings for the sayMessage function
and tell the user what options are available.

\defun{sayExample}{sayExample}
This function expects 2 arguments, the documentation string and
the name of the operation. It searches the documentation string for
\verb|++X| lines. These lines are examples lines for functions. 
They look like ordinary \verb|++| comments and fit into the ordinary
comment blocks. So, for example, in the plot.spad.pamphlet file we
find the following function signature:
\begin{verbatim}
    plot: (F -> F,R) -> %
      ++ plot(f,a..b) plots the function \spad{f(x)} 
      ++ on the interval \spad{[a,b]}.
      ++ 
      ++X fp:=(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT +-> sin(t)
      ++X plot(fp,-1.0..1.0)$PLOT
\end{verbatim}
This function splits out and prints the lines that begin with \verb|++X|.

A minor complication of printing the examples is that the lines have
been processed into internal compiler format. Thus the lines that read:
\begin{verbatim}
      ++X fp:=(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT +-> sin(t)
      ++X plot(fp,-1.0..1.0)$PLOT
\end{verbatim}
are actually stored as one long line containing the example lines
\begin{verbatim}
"\\indented{1}{plot(\\spad{f},{}a..\\spad{b}) plots the function
 \\spad{f(x)}} \\indented{1}{on the interval \\spad{[a,{}b]}.}
 \\blankline
 \\spad{X} fp:=(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT +-> sin(\\spad{t})
 \\spad{X} plot(\\spad{fp},{}\\spad{-1}.0..1.0)\\$PLOT"
\end{verbatim}

So when we have an example line starting with ++X, it gets
converted to the compiler to \verb|\spad{X}|. So each 
example line is delimited by \verb|\spad{X}|. 

The compiler also removes the newlines so
if there is a subsequent \verb|\spad{X}| in the docstring
then it implies multiple example lines and we loop over them, 
splitting them up at the delimiter.

If there is only one then we clean it up and print it.

\calls{sayexample}{cleanupline}
\calls{sayexample}{sayNewLine}
\begin{chunk}{defun sayExample}
(defun sayExample (docstring)
 (let (line point)
  (when (setq point (search "spad{X}" docstring))
   (setq line (subseq docstring (+ point 8)))
   (do ((mark (search "spad{X}" line) (search "spad{X}" line)))
     ((null mark))
    (princ (cleanupLine (subseq line 0 mark)))
    (terpri)
    (setq line (subseq line (+ mark 8))))
   (princ (cleanupLine line))
   (terpri)
   (terpri))))

\end{chunk}

\defun{cleanupLine}{cleanupLine}
This function expects example lines in internal format that has been
partially processed to remove the prefix. Thus we get lines that look 
like:
\begin{verbatim}
 fp:=(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT +-> sin(\\spad{t}) 
 plot(\\spad{fp},{}\\spad{-1}.0..1.0)\\$PLOT
\end{verbatim}

It removes all instances of \verb|{}|, and \verb|\|, and unwraps the
\verb|spad{}| call, leaving only the argument.

We return lines that look like:
\begin{verbatim}
 fp:=(t:DFLOAT):DFLOAT +-> sin(t)
 plot(fp,-1.0..1.0)$PLOT
\end{verbatim}
which is hopefully exactly what the user wrote.

The compiler inserts \verb|{}| as a space so we remove it.
We remove all of the \verb|\| characters.
We remove all of the \verb|spad{...}| delimiters which will
occur around other spad variables. Technically we should
search recursively for the matching delimiter rather than the
next brace but the problem does not arise in practice.
\begin{chunk}{defun cleanupLine 0}
(defun cleanupLine (line)
 (do ((mark (search "{}" line) (search "{}" line)))

A.9.  )edit
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )edit [filename]
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to edit files. It works in conjunction with the )read
and )compile commands to remember the name of the file on which you are
working. By specifying the name fully, you can edit any file you wish. Thus
 
)edit /u/julius/matrix.input
 
will place you in an editor looking at the file /u/julius/matrix.input. By
default, the editor is vi, but if you have an EDITOR shell environment
variable defined, that editor will be used. When AXIOM is running under the X
Window System, it will try to open a separate xterm running your editor if it
thinks one is necessary. For example, under the Korn shell, if you issue
 
export EDITOR=emacs
 
then the emacs editor will be used by )edit.
 
If you do not specify a file name, the last file you edited, read or compiled
will be used. If there is no ``last file'' you will be placed in the editor
editing an empty unnamed file.
 
It is possible to use the )system command to edit a file directly. For
example,
 
)system emacs /etc/rc.tcpip
 
calls emacs to edit the file.

All this material is available in the AXIOM User Guide and in HyperDoc. In
HyperDoc, choose the Commands item from the Reference menu.
 
====================================================================
A.1.  Introduction
====================================================================
 
 
System commands are used to perform AXIOM environment management. Among the
commands are those that display what has been defined or computed, set up
multiple logical AXIOM environments (frames), clear definitions, read files
of expressions and commands, show what functions are available, and terminate
AXIOM.
 
Some commands are restricted: the commands
 
)set userlevel interpreter
)set userlevel compiler
)set userlevel development
 
set the user-access level to the three possible choices. All commands are
available at development level and the fewest are available at interpreter
level. The default user-level is interpreter. In addition to the )set command
(discussed in description of command )set ) you can use the HyperDoc settings
facility to change the user-level. Click on [Settings] here to immediately go
to the settings facility. 
 
Each command listing begins with one or more syntax pattern descriptions plus
examples of related commands. The syntax descriptions are intended to be easy
to read and do not necessarily represent the most compact way of specifying
all possible arguments and options; the descriptions may occasionally be
redundant.
 
All system commands begin with a right parenthesis which should be in the
first available column of the input line (that is, immediately after the
input prompt, if any). System commands may be issued directly to AXIOM or be
included in .input files.
 
A system command argument is a word that directly follows the command name
and is not followed or preceded by a right parenthesis. A system command
option follows the system command and is directly preceded by a right
parenthesis. Options may have arguments: they directly follow the option.
This example may make it easier to remember what is an option and what is an
argument:
 
         )syscmd arg1 arg2 )opt1 opt1arg1 opt1arg2 )opt2 opt2arg1 ...
 
In the system command descriptions, optional arguments and options are
enclosed in brackets (``['' and ``]''). If an argument or option name is in
italics, it is meant to be a variable and must have some actual value
substituted for it when the system command call is made. For example, the
syntax pattern description
 
)read fileName [)quietly]
 
would imply that you must provide an actual file name for fileName but need
not use the )quietly option. Thus
 
)read matrix.input
 
is a valid instance of the above pattern.
 
System command names and options may be abbreviated and may be in upper or
lower case. The case of actual arguments may be significant, depending on the
particular situation (such as in file names). System command names and
options may be abbreviated to the minimum number of starting letters so that
the name or option is unique. Thus
 
)s Integer
 
is not a valid abbreviation for the )set command, because both )set and )show
begin with the letter ``s''. Typically, two or three letters are sufficient
for disambiguating names. In our descriptions of the commands, we have used
no abbreviations for either command names or options.
 
In some syntax descriptions we use a vertical line ``|'' to indicate that you
must specify one of the listed choices. For example, in
 
)set output fortran on | off
 
only on and off are acceptable words for following boot. We also sometimes
use ``...'' to indicate that additional arguments or options of the listed
form are allowed. Finally, in the syntax descriptions we may also list the
syntax of related commands.

====================================================================
A.13.  )history
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )history )on
  - )history )off
  - )history )write historyInputFileName
  - )history )show [n] [both]
  - )history )save savedHistoryName
  - )history )restore [savedHistoryName]
  - )history )reset
  - )history )change n
  - )history )memory
  - )history )file
  - %
  - %%(n)
  - )set history on | off
 
Command Description: 
 
The history facility within AXIOM allows you to restore your environment to
that of another session and recall previous computational results. Additional
commands allow you to review previous input lines and to create an .input
file of the lines typed to AXIOM.
 
AXIOM saves your input and output if the history facility is turned on (which
is the default). This information is saved if either of
 
)set history on
)history )on
 
has been issued. Issuing either
 
)set history off
)history )off
 
will discontinue the recording of information.
 
Whether the facility is disabled or not, the value of % in AXIOM always
refers to the result of the last computation. If you have not yet entered
anything, % evaluates to an object of type Variable('%). The function %% may
be used to refer to other previous results if the history facility is
enabled. In that case, %%(n) is the output from step n if n > 0. If n < 0,
the step is computed relative to the current step. Thus %%(-1) is also the
previous step, %%(-2), is the step before that, and so on. If an invalid step
number is given, AXIOM will signal an error.
 
The environment information can either be saved in a file or entirely in
memory (the default). Each frame ( description of command )frame ) has its
own history database. When it is kept in a file, some of it may also be kept
in memory for efficiency. When the information is saved in a file, the name
of the file is of the form FRAME.axh where ``FRAME'' is the name of the
current frame. The history file is placed in the current working directory
(see description of command )cd ). Note that these history database files are
not text files (in fact, they are directories themselves), and so are not in
human-readable format.
 
The options to the )history command are as follows:
 
  )change n
    will set the number of steps that are saved in memory to n. This option
    only has effect when the history data is maintained in a file. If you
    have issued )history )memory (or not changed the default) there is no
    need to use )history )change.
 
  )on
    will start the recording of information. If the workspace is not empty,
    you will be asked to confirm this request. If you do so, the workspace
    will be cleared and history data will begin being saved. You can also
    turn the facility on by issuing )set history on.
 
  )off
    will stop the recording of information. The )history )show command will
    not work after issuing this command. Note that this command may be issued
    to save time, as there is some performance penalty paid for saving the
    environment data. You can also turn the facility off by issuing )set
    history off.
 
  )file
    indicates that history data should be saved in an external file on disk.
 
  )memory
    indicates that all history data should be kept in memory rather than
    saved in a file. Note that if you are computing with very large objects
    it may not be practical to kept this data in memory.
 
  )reset
    will flush the internal list of the most recent workspace calculations so
    that the data structures may be garbage collected by the underlying Lisp
    system. Like )history )change, this option only has real effect when
    history data is being saved in a file.
 
  )restore [savedHistoryName]
    completely clears the environment and restores it to a saved session, if
    possible. The )save option below allows you to save a session to a file
    with a given name. If you had issued )history )save jacobi the command
    )history )restore jacobi would clear the current workspace and load the
    contents of the named saved session. If no saved session name is
    specified, the system looks for a file called last.axh.
 
  )save savedHistoryName
    is used to save a snapshot of the environment in a file. This file is
    placed in the current working directory (see description of command )cd
    ). Use )history )restore to restore the environment to the state
    preserved in the file. This option also creates an input file containing
    all the lines of input since you created the workspace frame (for
    example, by starting your AXIOM session) or last did a )clear all or
    )clear completely.
 
  )show [n] [both]
    can show previous input lines and output results. )show will display up
    to twenty of the last input lines (fewer if you haven't typed in twenty
    lines). )show n will display up to n of the last input lines. )show both
    will display up to five of the last input lines and output results. )show
    n both will display up to n of the last input lines and output results.
 
  )write historyInputFile
    creates an .input file with the input lines typed since the start of the
    session/frame or the last )clear all or )clear completely. If
    historyInputFileName does not contain a period (``.'') in the filename,
    .input is appended to it. For example, )history )write chaos and )history
    )write chaos.input both write the input lines to a file called
    chaos.input in your current working directory. If you issued one or more
    )undo commands, )history )write eliminates all input lines backtracked
    over as a result of )undo. You can edit this file and then use )read to
    have AXIOM process the contents.

History recording is done in two different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item all changes in variable bindings (i.e. previous values) are
written to \verb|$HistList|, which is a circular list
\item all new bindings (including the binding to \verb|%|) are written to a
file called histFileName()
one older session is accessible via the file \verb|$oldHistFileName()|
\end{itemize}

\section{Initialized history variables}
The following global variables are used:
\begin{list}{}
\item \verb|$HistList|, \verb|$HistListLen| and \verb|$HistListAct| 
       which is the actual number of ``undoable'' steps)
\item \verb|$HistRecord| collects the input line, all variable bindings
      and the output of a step, before it is written to the file
      histFileName().
\item \verb|$HiFiAccess| is a flag, which is reset by )history )off
\end{list}

The result of step n can be accessed by \verb|%n|, which is translated
into a call of fetchOutput(n). The updateHist is called after every
interpreter step. The putHist function records all changes in the
environment to \verb|$HistList| and \verb|$HistRecord|.

User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )library libName1  [libName2 ...]
  - )library )dir dirName
  - )library )only objName1  [objlib2 ...]
  - )library )noexpose
 
Command Description: 
 
This command replaces the )load system command that was available in AXIOM
releases before version 2.0. The )library command makes available to AXIOM
the compiled objects in the libraries listed.
 
For example, if you )compile dopler.spad in your home directory, issue )library
dopler to have AXIOM look at the library, determine the category and domain
constructors present, update the internal database with various properties of
the constructors, and arrange for the constructors to be automatically loaded
when needed. If the )noexpose option has not been given, the constructors
will be exposed (that is, available) in the current frame.
 
If you compiled a file you will have an NRLIB present, for example,
DOPLER.NRLIB, where DOPLER is a constructor abbreviation. The command
)library DOPLER will then do the analysis and database updates as above.
 
To tell the system about all libraries in a directory, use )library )dir
dirName where dirName is an explicit directory. You may specify ``.'' as the
directory, which means the current directory from which you started the
system or the one you set via the )cd command. The directory name is required.
 
You may only want to tell the system about particular constructors within a
library. In this case, use the )only option. The command )library dopler
)only Test1 will only cause the Test1 constructor to be analyzed, autoloaded,
etc..
 
Finally, each constructor in a library are usually automatically exposed when
the )library command is used. Use the )noexpose option if you not want them
exposed. At a later time you can use )set expose add constructor to expose
any hidden constructors.
 
Note for AXIOM beta testers: At various times this command was called )local
and )with before the name )library became the official name.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to terminate AXIOM and return to the operating system.
Other than by redoing all your computations or by using the )history )restore
command to try to restore your working environment, you cannot return to
AXIOM in the same state.
 
)pquit differs from the )quit in that it always asks for confirmation that
you want to terminate AXIOM (the ``p'' is for ``protected''). When you enter
the )pquit command, AXIOM responds
 
      Please enter y or yes if you really want to leave the interactive 
                environment and return to the operating system:
 
If you respond with y or yes, you will see the message
 
            You are now leaving the AXIOM interactive environment. 
    Issue the command axiom to the operating system to start a new session.
 
and AXIOM will terminate and return you to the operating system (or the
environment from which you invoked the system). If you responded with
something other than y or yes, then the message
 
        You have chosen to remain in the AXIOM interactive environment.
 
will be displayed and, indeed, AXIOM would still be running.

)set quit protected
 
has been issued. Otherwise, )quit will make AXIOM terminate and return you to
the operating system (or the environment from which you invoked the system).
 
The default setting is )set quit protected so that )quit and )pquit behave in
the same way. If you do issue
 
)set quit unprotected
 
we suggest that you do not (somehow) assign )quit to be executed when you
press, say, a function key.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to read .input files into AXIOM. The command
 
)read matrix.input
 
will read the contents of the file matrix.input into AXIOM. The ``.input''
file extension is optional. See the AXIOM User Guide index for more
information about .input files.
 
This command remembers the previous file you edited, read or compiled. If you
do not specify a file name, the previous file will be read.
 
The )ifthere option checks to see whether the .input file exists. If it does
not, the )read command does nothing. If you do not use this option and the
file does not exist, you are asked to give the name of an existing .input
file.
 
The )quiet option suppresses output while the file is being read.

A.18.  )regress
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )regress fileName
 
Command Description: 
 
The regress command will run the regress function that was compiled
as part of the lisp image build process. This function expects an
input filename, possibly containing a path prefix. 

If the filename contains a period then we consider it a fully formed
filename, otherwise we append ``.output'', which is the default file
extension.

  )regress matrix
  )regress matrix.output
  )regress /path/to/file/matrix
  )regress /path/to/file/matrix.output
 
will test the contents of the file matrix.output.

The idea behind regression testing is to check that the results
we currently get match the results we used to get. In order to
do that we create input files with a special comment format that
contains the prior results. These are easy to create as all you
need to do is run the Axiom function, capture the results, and
turn them input specially formed comments using the -- comment.

A regression file caches the result of an Axiom function so we
can automate the testing process. It is a file of many tests,
each with their own output.

The regression file format uses the Axiom -- comment syntax to keep
a copy of the expected output from an Axiom command. This expected
output is compared character by character against the actual output.

The regression file is broken into numbered blocks, delimited by
a --S for the beginning and a --E for the end. The total number of
blocks is also given so missing or failed tests also raise an error.

There are 4 special kinds of -- comments in regression files:

  --S n of M        this is test n of M tests in this file
  --E n             this marks the end of test n
  --R any output    this marks the actual expected output line
  --I any output    this line is compared but ignored

A regression test file looks like:

  )set break resume
  )spool foo.output
  )set message type off
  )clear all

  --S 1 of 3
  2+3
  --R                     this is the exact Axiom output
  --R   (1)  5
  --E 1

  --S 2 of 3
  2+3
  --R                     this should fail to match
  --R   (2)  7
  --E 2

  --S 3 of 3
  2+3
  --R                     this fails to match but we
  --I   (3)  7            use --I to ignore this line
  --E 3

We can now run this file with

  )read foo.input

Note that when this file is run it will create a spool file called
"foo.output" because of the lines:
  
  )spool foo.output
  )spool

The "foo.output" file contains the console image of the result. 
It will look like:

  Starts dribbling to foo.output (2012/2/28, 12:25:7).
  )set message type off
  )clear all

  --S 1 of 3
  2+3
  
     (1)  5
  --R
  --R   (1)  5
  --E 1
  
  --S 2 of 3
  2+3
  
     (2)  5
  --R
  --R   (2)  7
  --E 2

  --S 3 of 3
  2+3
  
     (3)  5
  --R
  --I   (3)  7
  --E 3

  )spool

This "foo.output" file can now be checked using the )regress command.
 
When we run the )regress foo.output we see;

  testing foo
  passed foo  1 of 3
  MISMATCH
  expected:"   (2)  7"
       got:"   (2)  5"
  FAILED foo  2 of 2
  passed foo  3 of 3
  regression result FAILED 1 of 3 stanzas file foo

Tests either pass or fail. A passing test generates the message:

    passed foo  1 of 3

A failing test will give a reversed printout of the expected vs
actual output as well as a FAILED message, as in:

  MISMATCH
  expected:"   (2)  7"
       got:"   (2)  5"
  FAILED foo  2 of 3

The last line of output is a summary:

  regression result FAILED 1 of 3 stanzas file foo

\subsection{The regress function details}
This is the regression test mechanism. The input files have been
rewritten to have a standard structure. This fixed format identifies
the tests within a file. Each test is run and any mismatch between
the actual and expected results is reported.

In order to regression test axiom results we created a standard
file format. This format has 3 kinds of markers:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``--S'' marker which must have a integer test number
\item ``--R'' marker lines, one per expected output from axiom
\item ``--E'' marker which has an integer matching the preceeding ``--S''
\item ``--I'' marker ignores the line, useful for gensyms and random
\end{itemize}
Because these markers use Axiom's standard comment prefix they
are valid lines in input files and are ignored by the ``)read''
command. They are simply copied to the output file. This allows
us to include the expected output in the output file so we can
compare what Axiom computes with what it should compute.

To create these regression files all you need to do is create an
input file and run it through Axiom. Then, for each test case in
the file you mark it up by putting a ``--S number'' {\bf before}
the Axiom input line. You put ``--R'' prefixes on each line of
Axiom output, including the blank lines. Then you put a ``--E number''
line after the last output line, usually the {\tt Type:} line.
This newly marked-up input file is now a regression test.

To actually run the regression test you simply include the
marked up the input file in the {\tt src/input} subdirectory.
This file will automatically be run at build time and any failing
tests will be marked. This code will ignore any input that does
not contain proper regression markups.

Ideally the regression test files should be pamphlet files that
explain the content and purpose of each regression test case.

Thus you run the marked-up input file {\tt foo.input}
and spool the result to {\tt foo.output} and then run the 
lisp function\\ 
{\tt (regress ``foo.output'')}

If the file does not contain proper regression markups it is
ignored. Comments or any other commands in the file that are not
surrounded by ``--S'' and ``--E'' boundaries are ignored.

\defvar{*all-tests-ran*}
This variable is used to check whether all of the tests actually
ran. This is needed to see if the execution ended early.
\begin{chunk}{initvars}

\end{chunk}

\defun{regress}{Scan a spool output file for failures}
This function takes an output file which has been created by the
Axiom {\tt )spool} command and looks for regression test markups.
Each regression test is checked against the actual result and any
failures are marked.

\end{chunk}

\defun{getspoolname}{Parse test name from the spool command}
We need to parse out the name of the test. The ``)spool'' command
writes a line into the output file containing the name of the test.
We parse out the name of the test from this line.
\begin{chunk}{defun getspoolname 0}

  (setq line (read-line stream))
  (setq point (position #\. line))
  (if (or (null point) 
      (< (length line) 30)
      (not (string= (subseq line (+ point 1) (+ point 7)) "output")))
    nil
  (subseq line 20 point))))

\end{chunk}

\defun{findnexttest}{Find the next --S marker}
We need to break the file into separate test cases. This routine
looks for the ``--S'' line which indicates a test is starting. It
collects up input lines until it encounters the ``--E'' line marking
the end of the test case. These lines are returned as a list of strings.

\calls{findnexttest}{testnumberp}
\begin{chunk}{defun findnexttest}
(defun findnexttest (stream)
 (let (teststart result)
  (do ((line (read-line stream nil 'done) (read-line stream nil 'done)))
      ((or (eq line 'done) (endedp line))
        (values (if line teststart) result))
   (if teststart 
    (push line result) 
    (setq teststart (testnumberp line))))))

\end{chunk}

\defun{testnumberp}{Parse out the test number from --S lines}
The ``--S'' line has a test number on the line. We parse out the
test number for printing.
\calls{testnumberp}{startp}
\begin{chunk}{defun testnumberp}
(defun testnumberp (oneline)
 (when (startp oneline) (subseq oneline 3)))

\end{chunk}

\defvar{*ok*}
We can mark a test as always ok by putting the word ``ok'' anywhere
on the start line. The regress function resets this value. The startp
function checks the --S line for the word ``ok''. If found, it sets
this value to true which causes a failing test to be considered as
passed.
\begin{chunk}{initvars}
(defvar *ok* nil "did we mark this test as always ok?")

\end{chunk}

\defun{testpassed}{Compare the computed and expected results}
This routine takes the test input, passes it to split to clean up
and break into two lists, and then compares the resulting lists
element by element, complaining about any mismatches. The result
is either true if everything passes or false if a mismatch occurs.

A test line can also be considered at passing if the expected line
is the string ``ignore''.

The ok variable allows us to mark failing tests as ``ok'' because
we expect the test might fail due to random values or testing known
bugs against expected output. We filter these tests marked ``ok''
so they do not count as ``real'' failures.

\calls{testpassed}{split}
\uses{testpassed}{*ok*}
\begin{chunk}{defun testpassed}
(defun testpassed (test)
 (let (answer expected (passed t) mismatchedLines)
  (declare (special *ok*))
  (multiple-value-setq (answer expected) (split test))
  (dotimes (i (length answer))
   (unless 
    (or (string= (first expected) "ignore")
        (string= (first expected) (first answer)))
    (unless *ok* (setq passed nil))
    (push (cons (first expected) (first answer)) mismatchedLines))
   (pop answer)
   (pop expected))
  (when mismatchedLines
   (dolist (pair mismatchedLines)
    (format t "expected:~s~%     got:~s~%"  (car pair) (cdr pair))))
  passed))

\end{chunk}

\defun{split}{Split the calculated and expect results into lists}
We have a list containing all of the lines in a test. The input is of
the form:
\begin{verbatim}
("--R                                         Type: List Integer"
 "--R   (1)  [1,4,2,- 6,0,3,5,4,2,3]" 
 "--R" 
 "--R "
 "                                         Type: List Integer"
 "   (1)  [1,4,2,- 6,0,3,5,4,2,3]" 
 "" 
 " "
 "l := [1,4,2,-6,0,3,5,4,2,3]")
\end{verbatim}
It removes the ``--R'' prefix from the result strings
and generates two hopefully equal-length lists, thus:
\begin{verbatim}
("                                         Type: List Integer"
 "   (1)  [1,4,2,- 6,0,3,5,4,2,3]" 
 "" 
 " ")
("                                         Type: List Integer"
 "   (1)  [1,4,2,- 6,0,3,5,4,2,3]" 
 "" 
 " "))
\end{verbatim}
Thus the first line is the start line, the second line is the Axiom 
input line, followed by the Axiom output. Then we have the lines marked
``--R'' which are the expected result. We split these into two separate
lists and throw way the lines that are the start and end lines. 

Once we have classified all of the lines we need to throw away the
input lines.  By assumption there will be more answer lines than
expected lines because the input lines are included. And given the way
we process the file these input lines are on the top of the answer
stack. Since the number of answer lines should equal the number of
expected lines we pop the stack until the numbers are equal.

Each element of the answer list should
be {\tt string=} to the corresponding element of the result list.

If the input line starts with ``--I'' we push the string ``ignore''.
This is useful for handling random results or gensym symbols.

\defun{startp}{Returns true on --S lines}
This test returns true if we have a ``start'' line. That is, a line
with a ``--S'' prefix. 

The *all-tests-ran* variable is true if the start line is of the form
"--S N of M" and N=M, that is, it checks that all tests were performed
since this should only occur on the last start line. This will detect
``premature exit'' in processing.

If a test is failing because of random input values or we want the
test to fail but not to count toward failing values then put the
string ``ok'' somewhere on the ``--S'' line as in:
\begin{verbatim}
--S 29 of 42 fails due to random values but that is ok
\end{verbatim}

\end{chunk}

\defun{resultp}{Returns true on --R lines}

with a ``--R'' prefix.
\begin{chunk}{defun resultp 0}
(defun resultp (oneline)
 (and (>= (length oneline) 3) (string= (subseq oneline 0 3) "--R")))

\end{chunk}

\defun{ignorep}{Returns true on --I lines}
This test returns true if we have an ``ignore'' line. That is, a line
with a ``--I'' prefix.
\begin{chunk}{defun ignorep 0}
(defun ignorep (oneline)
 (and (>= (length oneline) 3) (string= (subseq oneline 0 3) "--I")))

\end{chunk}

\defun{lastcount}{Check the last --S line ran}
If the ``--S'' line has the format ``--S n of m'' we return true if 
n=m, false otherwise.
Thus,

tests actually ran rather than having the regression test exit
early and quietly. This will be false on all but the last test
and will be false if the ``--S'' line does not contain the optional
count marker. It is not required but is highly recommended.

A.8.  )savesystem
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )savesystem filename
 
Command Description: 
 
 This command is used to save an AXIOM image to disk.  This creates an
executable file which, when started, has everything loaded into it
that was there when the image was saved.  Thus, after executing commands
which cause the loading of some packages, the command:
 
)savesystem /tmp/savesys

will create an image that can be restarted  with the UNIX command:

axiom -ws /tmp/savesys

This new system will not need to reload the packages and domains that
were already loaded when the system was saved.

There is currently a restriction that only systems started with the 
command "AXIOMsys" may be saved.

   axiom
   (1) -> t1:=4
   (1) -> )savesystem foo

and Axiom exits. Then do

   ./foo
   (1) -> t1
   4

\end{chunk} 

\defvar{*ThisIsARunningSystem*}
When a user does
\begin{verbatim}
  )savesystem foo
\end{verbatim}
we set this variable to true. This is tested in the restart function,
which is called when the system starts, to prevent losing user
information.

====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )set
  -  )set label1 [... labelN]
  -  )set label1 [... labelN] newValue
 
Command Description: 
 
The )set command is used to view or set system variables that control what
messages are displayed, the type of output desired, the status of the history
facility, the way AXIOM user functions are cached, and so on. Since this
collection is very large, we will not discuss them here. Rather, we will show
how the facility is used. We urge you to explore the )set options to
familiarize yourself with how you can modify your AXIOM working environment.
There is a HyperDoc version of this same facility available from the main
HyperDoc menu. Click [here] to go to it. 
 
The )set command is command-driven with a menu display. It is
tree-structured. To see all top-level nodes, issue )set by itself.
 
)set
 
Variables with values have them displayed near the right margin. Subtrees of
selections have ``...'' displayed in the value field. For example, there are
many kinds of messages, so issue )set message to see the choices.
 
)set message
 
The current setting for the variable that displays whether computation times
are displayed is visible in the menu displayed by the last command. To see
more information, issue
 
)set message time
 
This shows that time printing is on now. To turn it off, issue
 
)set message time off
 
As noted above, not all settings have so many qualifiers. For example, to
change the )quit command to being unprotected (that is, you will not be
prompted for verification), you need only issue
 
)set quit unprotected

o )quit

The argument settree is initially the \verb|$setOption| variable.
The fourth element is a union-style switch symbol.
The fifth element is usually a variable to set.
The sixth element is a subtree to recurse for the TREE switch.
The seventh element is usually the default value. For more detailed

   interpreter
   LITERALS
   $UserLevel
   (interpreter compiler development)
   development)
\end{verbatim}
The list contains (the names in bold are accessor names that can be
found in {\bf property.lisp.pamphlet}. Look for "setName".):
\begin{list}{}
\item {\bf 1} {\sl Name} the keyword the user will see. In this example
the user would say "{\bf )set output userlevel}".
\item {\bf 2} {\sl Label} the message the user will see. In this example
the user would see "operation access level of system user".
\item {\bf 3} {\sl Level} the level where the command will be 
accepted. There are three levels: interpreter, compiler, development.
These commands are restricted to keep the user from causing damage.
\item {\bf 4} {\sl Type} a symbol, one of {\bf FUNCTION}, {\bf INTEGER},
{\bf STRING}, {\bf LITERALS}, {\bf FILENAME} or {\bf TREE}. 
\item {\bf 5} {\sl Var} 
\begin{list}{}
\item FUNCTION is the function to call
\item INTEGER is the variable holding the current user setting.
\item STRING is the variable holding the current user setting.
\item LITERALS variable which holds the current user setting.
\item FILENAME is the variable that holds the current user setting.
\item TREE
\end{list}
\item {\bf 6} {\sl Leaf} 
\begin{list}{}
\item FUNCTION is the list of all possible values
\item INTEGER is the range of possible values
\item STRING is a list of all possible values
\item LITERALS is a list of all of the possible values
\item FILENAME is the function to check the filename
\item TREE
\end{list}
\item {\bf 7} {\sl Def} is the default value 
\begin{list}{}
\item FUNCTION is the default setting
\item INTEGER is the default setting
\item STRING is the default setting

\section{\enspace{}set debug dalymode}
The \verb|$dalymode| variable is used in a case statement in 
intloopReadConsole. This variable can be set to any non-nil
value. When not nil the interpreter will send any line that begins
with an ``('' to be sent to the underlying lisp. This is useful
for debugging Axiom. The normal value of this variable is NIL.

This variable was created as an alternative to prefixing every lisp
command with )lisp. When doing a lot of debugging this is tedious
and error prone. This variable was created to shortcut that process.
Clearly it breaks some semantics of the language accepted by the
interpreter as parens are used for grouping expressions.

 Description: number of function results to cache

 )set functions cache is used to tell AXIOM how many  values 
  computed by interpreter functions should be saved.  This can 
  save quite a bit of time in recursive functions, though one 
  must consider that the cached values will take up (perhaps 
  valuable) room in the workspace.

 The value given  after cache must either be the word all or 
 a positive integer. This may be followed by any number of 
 function names whose cache sizes you wish to so set.  If no 
 functions are given, the default cache  size is set.

 Examples:   )set fun cache all
             )set fun cache 10 f g Legendre

 In general, functions will cache no returned values.

\begin{verbatim}
--------------------- The algebra Option ----------------------

 Description: display output in algebraic form

 )set output algebra is used to tell AXIOM to turn algebra-style
  output printing on and off, and where to place the output.  By
  default, the destination for the output is the screen but 
  printing is turned off.

Syntax:   )set output algebra <arg>
    where arg can be one of
  on          turn algebra printing on (default state)
  off         turn algebra printing off
  console     send algebra output to screen (default state)
  fp<.fe>     send algebra output to file with file prefix fp
              and file extension .fe. If not given, 
              .fe defaults to .spout.

If you wish to send the output to a file, you may need to issue
this command twice: once with on and once with the file name. 
For example, to send algebra output to the file polymer.spout,
issue the two commands

  )set output algebra on
  )set output algebra polymer

The output is placed in the directory from which you invoked 
AXIOM or the one you set with the )cd system command.
The current setting is:  On:CONSOLE

\subsection{set output fortran}
\begin{verbatim}
--------------------- The fortran Option ----------------------

 Description: create output in FORTRAN format

 )set output fortran is used to tell AXIOM to turn FORTRAN-style
  output printing on and off, and where to place the output.  By
  default, the destination for the output is the screen but 
  printing is turned off.

Also See: )set fortran

Syntax:   )set output fortran <arg>
    where arg can be one of
  on          turn FORTRAN printing on
  off         turn FORTRAN printing off (default state)
  console     send FORTRAN output to screen (default state)
  fp<.fe>     send FORTRAN output to file with file prefix 
              fp and file extension .fe. If not given, 
              .fe defaults to .sfort.

If you wish to send the output to a file, you must issue 
this command twice: once with on and once with the file name.
For example, to send FORTRAN output to the file polymer.sfort,
 issue the two commands

  )set output fortran on
  )set output fortran polymer

The output is placed in the directory from which you invoked
AXIOM or the one you set with the )cd system command.
The current setting is:  Off:CONSOLE

Syntax:   )set output html <arg>
    where arg can be one of
  on          turn html printing on
  off         turn html printing off (default state)
  console     send html output to screen (default state)
  fp<.fe>     send html output to file with file prefix fp
              and file extension .fe. If not given, 
              .fe defaults to .html.

If you wish to send the output to a file, you must issue 
this command twice: once with on and once with the file name. 
For example, to send MathML output to the file polymer.html, 
issue the two commands

  )set output html on
  )set output html polymer

The output is placed in the directory from which you invoked 
Axiom or the one you set with the )cd system command.
The current setting is:  Off:CONSOLE

---------------------- The script Option ----------------------

 Description: display output in SCRIPT formula format

 )set output script is used to tell AXIOM to turn IBM Script
 formula-style output printing on and off, and where to place
 the output.  By default, the destination for the output is the 
 screen but printing is turned off.

Syntax:   )set output script <arg>
    where arg can be one of
  on      turn IBM Script formula printing on
  off     turn IBM Script formula printing off 
          (default state)
  console send IBM Script formula output to screen 
          (default state)
  fp<.fe> send IBM Script formula output to file with file 
          prefix fp and file extension .fe. If not given, 
          .fe defaults to .sform.

If you wish to send the output to a file, you must issue 
this command twice: once with on and once with the file 
name. For example, to send IBM Script formula output to 
the file polymer.sform, issue the two commands

  )set output script on
  )set output script polymer

The output is placed in the directory from which you 
invoked AXIOM or the one you set with the )cd system command.
The current setting is:  Off:CONSOLE

====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )show nameOrAbbrev
  - )show nameOrAbbrev )operations
  - )show nameOrAbbrev )attributes
 
Command Description: 
This command displays information about AXIOM domain, package and category
constructors. If no options are given, the )operations option is assumed. For
example,
 
)show POLY
)show POLY )operations
)show Polynomial
)show Polynomial )operations
 
each display basic information about the Polynomial domain constructor and
then provide a listing of operations. Since Polynomial requires a Ring (for
example, Integer) as argument, the above commands all refer to a unspecified
ring R. In the list of operations, $ means Polynomial(R).
 
The basic information displayed includes the signature of the constructor
(the name and arguments), the constructor abbreviation, the exposure status
of the constructor, and the name of the library source file for the
constructor.
 
If operation information about a specific domain is wanted, the full or
abbreviated domain name may be used. For example,
 
)show POLY INT
)show POLY INT )operations
)show Polynomial Integer
)show Polynomial Integer )operations
 
are among the combinations that will display the operations exported by the
domain Polynomial(Integer) (as opposed to the general domain constructor
Polynomial). Attributes may be listed by using the )attributes option.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to save (spool) all AXIOM input and output into a file,
called a spool file. You can only have one spool file active at a time. To
start spool, issue this command with a filename. For example,
 
)spool integrate.out
 
To stop spooling, issue )spool with no filename.
 
If the filename is qualified with a directory, then the output will be placed
in that directory. If no directory information is given, the spool file will
be placed in the current directory. The current directory is the directory
from which you started AXIOM or is the directory you specified using the )cd
command.

Command Description: 
 
This command may be used to issue commands to the operating system while
remaining in AXIOM. The cmdExpression is passed to the operating system for
execution.
 
To get an operating system shell, issue, for example, )system sh. When you
enter the key combination, Ctrl-D (pressing and holding the Ctrl key and then
pressing the D key) the shell will terminate and you will return to AXIOM. We
do not recommend this way of creating a shell because Lisp may field some
interrupts instead of the shell. If possible, use a shell running in another
window.
 
If you execute programs that misbehave you may not be able to return to
AXIOM. If this happens, you may have no other choice than to restart AXIOM
and restore the environment via )history )restore, if possible.

This command is used to restore the state of the user environment to an
earlier point in the interactive session. The argument of an )undo is an
integer which must designate some step number in the interactive session.
 
)undo n
)undo n )after
 
These commands return the state of the interactive environment to that
immediately after step n. If n is a positive number, then n refers to step
nummber n. If n is a negative number, it refers to the nth previous command
(that is, undoes the effects of the last -n commands).
 
A )clear all resets the )undo facility. Otherwise, an )undo undoes the effect
of )clear with options properties, value, and mode, and that of a previous
undo. If any such system commands are given between steps n and n + 1 (n >
0), their effect is undone for )undo m for any 0 < m <= n .
 
The command )undo is equivalent to )undo -1 (it undoes the effect of the
previous user expression). The command )undo 0 undoes any of the above system
commands issued since the last user expression.
 
)undo n )before
 
This command returns the state of the interactive environment to that
immediately before step n. Any )undo or )clear system commands given before
step n will not be undone.
 
)undo )redo
 
This command reads the file redo.input. created by the last )undo command.
This file consists of all user input lines, excluding those backtracked over
due to a previous )undo.
 
The command )history )write will eliminate the ``undone'' command lines of
your program.

\section{\enspace{}Evaluation}
Some Antique Comments About the Interpreter

EVAL BOOT contains the top level interface to the Scratchhpad-II
interpreter.  The Entry point into the interpreter from the parser is
processInteractive.

The type analysis algorithm is contained in the file BOTMUP BOOT,
and MODSEL boot,
the map handling routines are in MAP BOOT and NEWMAP BOOT, and
the interactive coerce routines are in COERCE BOOT and COERCEFN BOOT.

{\bf Conventions:}
All spad values in the interpreter are passed around in triples.
These are lists of three items: 
\begin{verbatim}
   [value,mode,environment]
\end{verbatim}
The value
may be wrapped (this is a pair whose CAR is the atom WRAPPED and
whose CDR is the value), which indicates that it is a real value,
or unwrapped in which case it needs to be EVALed to produce the
proper value.  The mode is the type of value, and should always be
completely specified (not contain \verb|$EmptyMode|).  The environment
is always empty, and is included for historical reasons.

{\bf Modemaps:}
Modemaps are descriptions of compiled Spad function which the
interpreter uses to perform type analysis. They consist of patterns
of types for the arguments, and conditions the types must satisfy
for the function to apply.  For each function name there is a list
of modemaps in file modemap DATABASE for each distinct function with
that name. The following is the list of the modemaps for ``*''
(multiplication. The first modemap (the one with the labels) is for
module mltiplication which is multiplication of an element of a
module by a member of its scalar domain.

This is the signature pattern for the modemap, it is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
    (DomainOfComputation TargetType <ArgumentType ...>)
          |
          |                This is the predicate that needs to be
          |                 satisfied for the modemap to apply
          |                            |
          V                            |
     /-----------/                     |
 ( ( (*1 *1 *2 *1)                     V
       /-----------------------------------------------------------/
     ( (AND (ofCategory *1 (Module *2)) (ofCategory *2 (SimpleRing))) )
      . CATDEF) <-- This is the file where the function was defined
   ( (*1 *1 *2 *1)
     ( (AND (isDomain *2 (Integer)) (ofCategory *1 (AbelianGroup))) )
      . CATDEF)
   ( (*1 *1 *2 *1)
     ( (AND
         (isDomain *2 (NonNegativeInteger))
         (ofCategory *1 (AbelianMonoid))) )
      . CATDEF)
   ((*1 *1 *1 *1) ((ofCategory *1 (SemiGroup)) ) . CATDEF)
      )
\end{verbatim}
{\bf Environments:}
Environments associate properties with atoms.

Some common properties are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf modeSet:}
During interpretation we build a modeSet property for each node in
the expression.  This is (in theory) a list of all the types
possible for the node.  In the current implementation these
modeSets always contain a single type.
\item {\bf value:}
Value properties are always triples.  This is where the values of
variables are stored.  We also build value properties for internal
nodes during the bottom up phase.
\item {\bf mode:}
This is the declared type of an identifier.
\end{itemize}

Frequently used global variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf \verb|$genValue|}: if true then evaluate generated code,
otherwise leave code unevaluated.  If \verb|$genValue| is false then
we are compiling.
\item {\bf \verb|$op|}: name of the top level operator 
(unused except in map printing)
\item {\bf \verb|$mapList|}: list of maps being type analyzed, used in
recursive map type anlysis.
\item {\bf \verb|$compilingLoop|}: true when compiling a loop body,
used to control nesting level of interp-only loop CATCH points
\item {\bf \verb|$interpOnly|}: true when in interpret only mode, used
to call alternate forms of COLLECT and REPEAT.
\item {\bf \verb|$inCOLLECT|}: true when compiling a COLLECT, used
only for hacked stream compiler.
\item {\bf \verb|$StreamFrame|}: used in printing streams, it is the
environment where local stream variables are stored
\item {\bf \verb|$declaredMode|}: Weak type propagation for symbols,
set in upCOERCE and upLET.  This variable is used to determine the
alternate polynomial types of Symbols.
\item {\bf \verb|$localVars|}: list of local variables in a map body
\item {\bf \verb|$MapArgumentTypeList|}: hack for stream compilation

====================================================================
A.28.  )what
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )what categories pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what commands   pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what domains    pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what operations pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what packages   pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what synonym    pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what things     pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )apropos         pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to display lists of things in the system. The patterns
are all strings and, if present, restrict the contents of the lists. Only
those items that contain one or more of the strings as substrings are
displayed. For example,
 
)what synonym
 
displays all command synonyms,
 
)what synonym ver
 
displays all command synonyms containing the substring ``ver'',
 
)what synonym ver pr
 
displays all command synonyms containing the substring ``ver'' or the
substring ``pr''. Output similar to the following will be displayed
 
---------------- System Command Synonyms -----------------
 

user-defined synonyms satisfying patterns:
      ver pr
 

  )apr ........................... )what things
  )apropos ....................... )what things
  )prompt ........................ )set message prompt
  )version ....................... )lisp *yearweek*
 
Several other things can be listed with the )what command:
 
  categories displays a list of category constructors.
  commands  displays a list of  system commands available  at your
    user-level. Your user-level is set via the )set userlevel command. To get
    a description of a particular command, such as ``)what'', issue )help
    what.
  domains   displays a list of domain constructors.
  operations displays a list of operations in  the system library.
    It is recommended that you qualify this command with one or more
    patterns, as there are thousands of operations available. For example,
    say you are looking for functions that involve computation of
    eigenvalues. To find their names, try )what operations eig. A rather
    large list of operations is loaded into the workspace when this command
    is first issued. This list will be deleted when you clear the workspace
    via )clear all or )clear completely. It will be re-created if it is
    needed again.
  packages  displays a list of package constructors.
  synonym  lists system command synonyms.
  things    displays all  of the  above types for  items containing
    the pattern strings as substrings. The command synonym )apropos is
    equivalent to )what things.

Special functions are ones which are not defined in the algebra
code, such as assignment, construct, COLLECT and declaration.

Operators which require special handlers all have a LISP ``up''
property which is the name of the special handler, which is
always the word ``up'' followed by the operator name.
If an operator has this ``up'' property the handler is called
automatically from bottomUp instead of general modemap selection.

The up handlers are usually split into two pieces, the first is
the up function itself, which performs the type analysis, and an
``eval'' function, which generates (and executes, if required) the
code for the function.

The up functions always take a single argument, which is the
entire attributed tree for the operation, and return the modeSet
of the node, which is a singleton list containing the type
computed for the node.

The eval functions can take any arguments deemed necessary.
Actual evaluation is done if \verb|$genValue| is true, otherwise code is
generated.

(See the function analyzeMap for other things that may affect
what is generated in these functions.)

These functions are required to do two things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item do a putValue on the operator vector with the computed value
     of the node, which is a triple.  This is usually done in the
     eval functions.
\item do a putModeSet on the operator vector with a list of the
     computed type of the node.  This is usually done in the
     up functions.
\end{enumerate}

There are several special modes used in these functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Void is the mode that should be used for all statements
     that do not otherwise return values, such as declarations,
     loops, IF-THEN's without ELSE's, etc..
\item \verb|$NoValueMode| and \verb|$ThrowAwayMode| used to be used 
      in situations where Void is now used, and are being phased out 
      completely.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Line Handling}

\subsection{Line Buffer}
The philosophy of lines is that
\begin{itemize}
\item NEXT LINE will always return a non-blank line or fail.
\item Every line is terminated by a blank character.
\end{itemize}
Hence there is always a current character, because there is never a 
non-blank line, and there is always a separator character between tokens 
on separate lines. Also, when a line is read, the character pointer is 
always positioned ON the first character.

\chapter{Axiom Build-time Functions}
\defun{spad-save}{spad-save}
The {\bf spad-save} function is just a cover function for more
lisp system specific save functions. There is no standard name
for saving a lisp image so we make one and conditionalize it
at compile time.

This function is passed the name of an image that will be saved.
The saved image contains all of the loaded functions.

This is used in the src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet in three places:
\begin{itemize}
\item creating depsys, an image for compiling axiom.

Some of the Common Lisp code we compile uses macros which
are assumed to be available at compile time. The {\bf DEPSYS}
image is created to contain the compile time environment
and saved. We pipe compile commands into this environment
to compile from Common Lisp to machine dependent code.
\begin{verbatim}
DEPSYS=${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/depsys
\end{verbatim}

\item creating savesys, an image for running axiom.

Once we've compile all of the Common Lisp files we fire up
a clean lisp image called {\bf LOADSYS}, load all of the
final executable code and save it out as {\bf SAVESYS}.
The {\bf SAVESYS} image is copied to the \verb|${MNT}/${SYS}/bin|
subdirectory and becomes the axiom executable image.
\begin{verbatim}
LOADSYS= ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/lisp
SAVESYS= ${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/interpsys
AXIOMSYS= ${MNT}/${SYS}/bin/AXIOMsys
\end{verbatim}


\item creating debugsys, an image with all interpreted functions loaded.

Occasionally we need to really get into the system internals.
The best way to do this is to run almost all of the lisp code
interpreted rather than compiled (note that cfuns.lisp and sockio.lisp
still need to be loaded in compiled form as they depend on the 
loader to link with lisp internals). This image is nothing more
than a load of the file src/interp/debugsys.lisp.pamphlet. If
you need to make test modifications you can add code to that
file and it will show up here.

DEBUGSYS=${OBJ}/${SYS}/bin/debugsys

\chapter{Exposure Groups}
Exposure groups are a way of controlling the namespace available
to the user. Certain algebra files are only useful for internal
purposes but they contain functions have common names (like 
``map''. In order to separate the user visible  functions
from the internal functions the algebra files are collected into
``exposure groups''. These large groups are grouped into sets in
the variable \verb|$globalExposureGroupAlist|.

Exposure group information is kept in the local frame. For more
information ``The Frame Mechanism'' \ref{TheFrameMechanism} on
page~\pageref{TheFrameMechanism}.

\chapter{Databases}
\section{Database structure}
In order to understand this program you need to understand some details
of the structure of the databases it reads. Axiom has 5 databases,
the interp.daase, operation.daase, category.daase, and
browse.daase. 

\subsection{kaf File Format}
This documentation refers to kaf files which are random access files.
nrlib files are kaf files (look for nrlib/index.kaf)
The format of a random access file is
\begin{verbatim}
byte-offset-of-key-table
first-entry
second-entry
...
last-entry
((key1 . first-entry-byte-address)
 (key2 . second-entry-byte-address)
 ...
 (keyN . last-entry-byte-address))
\end{verbatim}
The key table is a standard lisp alist.

To open a database you fetch the first number, seek to that location,
and (read) which returns the key-data alist. To look up data you
index into the key-data alist, find the ith-entry-byte-address,
seek to that address, and (read).

For instance, see src/share/algebra/users.daase/index.kaf

One existing optimization is that if the data is a simple thing like a
symbol then the nth-entry-byte-address is replaced by immediate data.

Another existing one is a compression algorithm applied to the
data so that the very long names don't take up so much space.
We could probably remove the compression algorithm as 64k is no
longer considered 'huge'. The database-abbreviation routine
handles this on read and write-compress handles this on write.

Indeed, a faster optimization is to simply read the whole database
into the image before it is saved. The system would be easier to
understand and the interpreter would be faster.

The fastest optimization is to fix the time stamp mechanism
which is currently broken. Making this work requires a small
bit of coordination at 'make' time which I forgot to implement.

\subsection{Database Files}

Database files are very similar to kaf files except that there
is an optimization (currently broken) which makes the first
item a pair of two numbers. The first number in the pair is
the offset of the key-value table, the second is a time stamp.
If the time stamp in the database matches the time stamp in
the image the database is not needed (since the internal hash
tables already contain all of the information). When the database
is built the time stamp is saved in both the gcl image and the
database.

Regarding the 'ancestors field in a category: At database build
time there exists a *ancestors-hash* hash table that gets filled
with CATEGORY (not domain) ancestor information. This later provides
the information that goes into interp.daase This *ancestors-hash*
does not exist at normal runtime (it can be made by a call to
genCategoryTable). Note that the ancestor information in
*ancestors-hash* (and hence interp.daase) involves \verb|#1|, \verb|#2|, etc
instead of R, Coef, etc. The latter thingies appear in all
.nrlib/index.kaf files. So we need to be careful when we )lib
categories and update the ancestor info.

This file contains the code to build, open and access the .daase
files. This file contains the code to )library nrlibs and asy files

There is a major issue about the data that resides in these
databases.  the fundamental problem is that the system requires more
information to build the databases than it needs to run the
interpreter.  in particular, modemap.daase is constructed using
properties like "modemaps" but the interpreter will never ask for
this information.

So, the design is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item the modemap.daase needs to be built. this is done by doing
a )library on ALL of the nrlib files that are going into the system.
this will bring in "modemap" information and add it to the
*modemaps-hash* hashtable.
\item database build proceeds, accessing the "modemap" property
from the hashtables. once this completes this information is never
used again.
\item the interp.daase database is built. this contains only the
information necessary to run the interpreter. note that during the
running of the interpreter users can extend the system by do a
)library on a new nrlib file. this will cause fields such as "modemap"
to be read and hashed.
\end{itemize}

Each constructor (e.g. LIST) had one library directory (e.g. LIST.nrlib). 
This directory contained a random access file called the index.kaf file. 
These files contain runtime information such as the operationAlist and
the ConstructorModemap. At system build time we merge all of these 
.nrlib/index.kaf files into one database, INTERP.daase.  Requests to 
get information from this database are cached so that multiple 
references do not cause additional disk i/o.

This database is left open at all times as it is used frequently by
the interpreter. one minor complication is that newly compiled files
need to override information that exists in this database.

The design calls for constructing a random read (kaf format) file
that is accessed by functions that cache their results. when the
database is opened the list of constructor-index pairs is hashed
by constructor name. a request for information about a constructor
causes the information to replace the index in the hash table. since
the index is a number and the data is a non-numeric sexpr there is
no source of confusion about when the data needs to be read.

The format of this new database is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
 first entry:
   an integer giving the byte offset to the constructor alist
   at the bottom of the file
 second and subsequent entries (one per constructor)
   (operationAlist)
   (constructorModemap)
   ....
 last entry: (pointed at by the first entry)
   an alist of (constructor . index) e.g.
      ( (PI offset-of-operationAlist offset-of-constructorModemap)
      (NNI offset-of-operationAlist offset-of-constructorModemap)
       ....)
  This list is read at open time and hashed by the car of each item.
\end{verbatim}

The system has been changed to use the property list of the
symbols rather than hash tables. since we already hashed once
to get the symbol we need only an offset to get the property
list. this also has the advantage that eq hash tables no longer
need to be moved during garbage collection.

There are 3 potential speedups that could be done. 
\begin{itemize}
\item the best would be to use the value cell of the symbol rather than the
property list but i'm unable to determine all uses of the
value cell at the present time.
\item a second speedup is to guarantee that the property list is
a single item, namely the database structure. this removes
an assoc but leaves one open to breaking the system if someone
adds something to the property list. this was not done because
of the danger mentioned.
\item a third speedup is to make the getdatabase call go away, either
by making it a macro or eliding it entirely. this was not done
because we want to keep the flexibility of changing the database forms.
\end{itemize}

The new design does not use hash tables. the database structure
contains an entry for each item that used to be in a hash table.
initially the structure contains file-position pointers and
these are replaced by real data when they are first looked up.
the database structure is kept on the property list of the
constructor, thus, (get '|DenavitHartenbergMatrix| 'database)
will return the database structure object.

Each operation has a property on its symbol name called 'operation
which is a list of all of the signatures of operations with that name.

This hash table is used to answer the question``does domain x
have category y?''. this is answered by constructing a pair of

Note that constructorcategory information need only be kept for
items of type category. this will be fixed in the next iteration
when the need for the various caches are reviewed

Note that the *modemaps-hash* information does not need to be kept
for system files. these are precomputed and kept in modemap.daase
however, for user-defined files these are needed.
Currently these are added to the database for 2 reasons;
there is a still-unresolved issue of user database extensions and
this information is used during database build time

\subsection{Database streams}
This are the streams for the databases. They are always open.
There is an optimization for speeding up system startup. If the

This is an initialization function for the constructor database
it sets up 2 hash tables, opens the database and hashes the index values.

There is a slight asymmetry in this code. The sourcefile information for
system files is only the filename and extension. For user files it
contains the full pathname. when the database is first opened the
sourcefile slot contains system names. The lookup function
has to prefix the ``\$spadroot'' information if the directory-namestring is
null (we don't know the real root at database build time).

An object-hash table is set up to look up nrlib and ao information.
this slot is empty until a user does a )library call. We remember
the location of the nrlib or ao file for the users local library
at that time. A {\tt NIL} result from this probe means that the
library is in the system-specified place. When we get into multiple
library locations this will also contain system files.

\defun{make-databases}{Make new databases}
Making new databases consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item reset all of the system hash tables
\item set up Union, Record and Mapping
\item map )library across all of the system files (fills the databases)
\item loading some normally autoloaded files
\item making some database entries that are computed (like ancestors)
\item writing out the databases
\item write out 'warm' data to be loaded into the image at build time
\end{enumerate}

Note that this process should be done in a clean image
followed by a rebuild of the system image to include
the new index pointers (e.g. *interp-stream-stamp*)

The system will work without a rebuild but it needs to
re-read the databases on startup. Rebuilding the system
will cache the information into the image and the databases
are opened but not read, saving considerable startup time.
Also note that the order the databases are written out is
critical. The interp.daase depends on prior computations and has
to be written out last.

The build-name-to-pamphlet-hash builds a hash table whose key->value is:
\begin{itemize}
\item abbreviation $->$ pamphlet file name
\item abbreviation-line $->$ pamphlet file position
\item constructor $->$ pamphlet file name
\item constructor-line $->$ pamphlet file position
\end{itemize}
is the symbol of the constructor name and whose value is the name of
the source file without any path information. We  hash the 
constructor abbreviation to pamphlet file name.

\end{verbatim}

Here I'll try to outline the interp database write procedure

\begin{verbatim}
(defun write-interpdb ()
 "build interp.daase from hash tables"
 (declare (special $spadroot *ancestors-hash*))
 (let (opalistpos modemapspos cmodemappos master masterpos obj *print-pretty*
        concategory categorypos kind niladic cosig abbrev defaultdomain
        ancestors ancestorspos out)
  (declare (special *print-pretty*))
  (print "building interp.daase")

; 1. We open the file we're going to create

  (setq out (open "interp.build" :direction :output))

; 2. We reserve some space at the top of the file for the key-time pair
;    We will overwrite these spaces just before we close the file.

  (princ "                              " out)

; 3. Make sure we write it out
  (finish-output out)

; 4. For every constructor in the system we write the parts:

  (dolist (constructor (|allConstructors|))
   (let (struct)

; 4a. Each constructor has a property list. A property list is a list
;     of (key . value) pairs. The property we want is called 'database
;     so there is a ('database . something) in the property list

    (setq struct (get constructor 'database))

; 5 We write the "operationsalist"
; 5a. We remember the current file position before we write
;     We need this information so we can seek to this position on read

    (setq opalistpos (file-position out))

; 5b. We get the "operationalist" and write it out

    (print (database-operationalist struct) out)

; 5c. We make sure it was written

    (finish-output out)

; 6 We write the "constructormodemap"
; 6a. We remember the current file position before we write

    (setq cmodemappos (file-position out))

; 6b. We get the "constructormodemap" and write it out

    (print (database-constructormodemap struct) out)

; 6c. We make sure it was written

    (finish-output out)

; 7. We write the "modemaps"
; 7a. We remember the current file position before we write

    (setq modemapspos (file-position out))

; 7b. We get the "modemaps" and write it out

    (print (database-modemaps struct) out)

; 7c. We make sure it was written

    (finish-output out)

; 8. We remember source file pathnames in the obj variable

    (setq obj
     (pathname-name
       (first (last (pathname-directory (database-object struct))))))

; 9. We write the "constructorcategory", if it is a category, else nil
; 9a. Get the constructorcategory 

    (setq concategory (database-constructorcategory struct))

; 9b. If we have any data we write it out, else we don't write it
;     Note that if there is no data then the byte index for the
;     constructorcatagory will not be a number but will be nil.

    (if concategory  ; if category then write data else write nil
     (progn
      (setq categorypos (file-position out))
      (print concategory out)
      (finish-output out))
     (setq categorypos nil))

; 10. We get a set of properties which are kept as "immediate" data
;     This means that the key table will hold this data directly
;     rather than as a byte index into the file.
; 10a. niladic data

    (setq niladic (database-niladic struct))

; 10b. abbreviation data (e.g. POLY for polynomial)

    (setq abbrev (database-abbreviation struct))

; 10c. cosig data

    (setq cosig (database-cosig struct))

; 10d. kind data

    (setq kind (database-constructorkind struct))

; 10e. defaultdomain data

    (setq defaultdomain (database-defaultdomain struct))

; 11. The ancestor data might exist. If it does we fetch it
;     and write it out. If it does not we place
;     and immediate value of nil in the key-value table

    (setq ancestors (gethash constructor *ancestors-hash*)) ;cattable.boot
    (if ancestors
     (progn
      (setq ancestorspos (file-position out))
      (print ancestors out)
      (finish-output out))
     (setq ancestorspos nil))

; 12. "master" is an alist. Each element of the alist has the name of
;     the constructor and all of the above attributes. When the loop
;     finishes we will have constructed all of the data for the key-value
;     table

    (push (list constructor opalistpos cmodemappos modemapspos
      obj categorypos niladic abbrev cosig kind defaultdomain
      ancestorspos) master)))

; 13. The loop is done, we make sure all of the data is written

  (finish-output out)

; 14. We remember where the key-value table will be written in the file

  (setq masterpos (file-position out))

; 15. We print the key-value table

  (print master out)

; 16. We make sure we write the table

  (finish-output out)

; 17. We go to the top of the file

  (file-position out 0)

; 18. We write out the (master-byte-position . universal-time) pair
;     Note that if the universal-time value matches the value of
;     *interp-stream-stamp* then there is no reason to read the
;     interp database because all of the data is already cached in
;     the image. This happens if you build a database and immediatly
;     save the image. The saved image already has the data since we
;     just wrote it out. If the *interp-stream-stamp* and the database
;     time stamp differ we "reread" the database on startup. Actually
;     we just open the database and fetch as needed. You can see fetches
;     by setting the *miss* variable non-nil.

  (print (cons masterpos (get-universal-time)) out)

; 19. We make sure we write it.

  (finish-output out)

; 20 And we are done

  (close out)))

We reserve some space for the (key-table-byte-position . timestamp)

We loop across the list of constructors dumping the data and
remembering the byte positions in a key-value pair table.

We dump the final key-value pair table, write the byte position and
time stamp at the top of the file and close the file.

\chapter{Common Lisp Algebra Support}
These functions are called directly from the algebra source code.
They fall into two basic categories, one are the functions that are
raw Comon Lisp calls and the other are Axiom specific functions or macros.

Raw function calls are used where there is an alignment of the Axiom
type and the underlying representation in Common Lisp. These form the
support pillars upon which Axiom rests. For instance, the 'EQ' function is
called to support the Axiom equivalent 'eq?' function.

Macros are used to add type information in order to make low level
operations faster. An example is the use of macros in DoubleFloat to
add Common Lisp type information. Since DoubleFloat is machine arithmetic
we give the compiler explicit type information so it can generate fast code.

Functions are used to do manipulations which are Common Lisp operations
but the Axiom semantics are not the same. Because Axiom was originally
written in Maclisp, then VMLisp, and then Common Lisp some of these old
semantics survive.

\defun{cgamma}{Complex Gamma $\Gamma(z)$}

The cgamma(z) function is the $\Gamma$ function for complex arguments 
implemented by Bruce Char, April-May, 1990.

Our text for complex gamma is H. Kuki's paper Complex Gamma
Function with Error Control"\cite{kuki72a}

It uses the reflection formula and the basic $z+1$ recurrence to
transform the argument into something that Stirling's asymptotic
formula can handle.

However along the way it does a few tricky things to reduce
problems due to roundoff/cancellation error for particular values.

Small float implementation of Gamma function.  Valid for
real arguments.  Maximum error (relative) seems to be
2-4 ulps for real $x$ $2<x<9$, and up to ten ulps for larger $x$
up to overflow.  See Hart and Cheney.

\chapter{OpenMath}
\section{A Technical Overview}

OpenMath\cite{Dewa} is a standard for representing mathematical data in as
unambiguous a way as possible. It can be used to exchange mathematical
objects between software packages or via email, or as a persistent
data format in a database. It is tightly focussed on representing
semantic information and is not intended to be used directly for
presentation, although tools exist to facilitate this.

The original motivation for OpenMath came from the Computer Algebra
community. Computer Algebra packages were getting bigger and more
unwieldy, and it seemed reasonable to adopt a generic "plug and play"
architecture to allow specialised programs to be used from general
purpose environments. There were plenty of mechanisms for connecting
software components together, but no common format for representing
the underlying data objects. It quickly became clear that any standard
had to be vendor-neutral and that objects encoded in OpenMath should
not be too verbose. This has led to the design outlined below.

In 1998, the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) produced its first
recommendation for the Extensible Markup Language (XML), intended to
be a universal format for representing structured information on the
worldwide web. It was swiftly followed by the first MathML
recommendation which is an XML application oriented mainly towards the
presentation (i.e. the rendering) of mathematical expressions.

The formal definition of OpenMath is contained within The OpenMath
Standard and its accompanying documents, and the reader is referred
there for more details.  

\subsection{The OpenMath Architecture}

The OpenMath representation of a mathematical structure is referred to
as an OpenMath object. This is an abstract structure which is
represented concretely via an OpenMath encoding. These encoded objects
are what an OpenMath application would read and write, and in practice
the OpenMath objects themselves almost never exist, except on
paper. The advantage of this is that OpenMath is not tied to any one
underlying mechanism: in the past we have used functional, SGML and
binary encodings. The current favourite is XML, as described below,
and we will tend to use XML notation when describing OpenMath objects
(even though strictly speaking the XML representation is an encoding).
OpenMath Objects

Formally, an OpenMath object is a labelled tree whose leaves are the
basic OpenMath objects integers, IEEE double precision floats, unicode
strings, byte arrays, variables or symbols. Of these, symbols are the
most interesting since they consist of a name and a reference to a
definition in an external document called a content dictionary (or
CD). Using XML notation where the element name OMS indicates an
OpenMath symbol, the following: 
\begin{verbatim}
    <OMS name="sin" cd="transc1"/>
\end{verbatim}
represents the usual sine function, as defined in the CD "transc1". A
basic OpenMath object is an OpenMath object, although its XML
representation will be:
\begin{verbatim}
  <OMOBJ>
    <OMS name="sin" cd="transc1"/>
  </OMOBJ>
\end{verbatim}

OpenMath objects can be built up recursively in a number of ways. The
simplest is function application, for example the expression sin(x)
can be represented by the XML:
\begin{verbatim}
  <OMOBJ>
    <OMA>
      <OMS name="sin" cd="transc1"/>
      <OMV name="x"/>
    </OMA>
  </OMOBJ>
\end{verbatim}
where OMV introduces a variable and OMA is the application
element. Another straightforward method is attribution which as the
name suggests can be used to add additional information (for example
"the AXIOM command which generated me was ...") to an object without
altering its fundamental meaning. More interesting are binding objects
which are used to represent an expression containing bound variables,
for example:
\begin{verbatim}
  <OMOBJ>
    <OMA>
      <OMS cd="calculus1" name="int"/>
      <OMS cd="transc1" name="sin"/>
    </OMA>
  </OMOBJ>
\end{verbatim}
represents the integral of the sin function, but the encoding:
\begin{verbatim}
  <OMOBJ>
    <OMA>
      <OMS cd="calculus1" name="int"/>
      <OMBIND>
        <OMS cd="fns1" name="lambda"/>
        <OMBVAR> <OMV name="x"/> </OMBVAR>
        <OMA>
          <OMS name="sin" cd="transc1"/>
          <OMV name="x"/>
        </OMA>
      </OMBIND>
    </OMA>
  </OMOBJ>
\end{verbatim}
represents ∫sin(x)dx. This may appear overly complicated but it is
useful, for example when searching in a database for expressions which
match ∫sin(y)dy . The definition of a symbol in the CD specifies
whether or not it may be used to bind variables, which is why 
\begin{verbatim}
   <OMS cd="calculus1" name="int"/> 
\end{verbatim}
cannot be used as a binding symbol.

The final kind of OpenMath object is an error which is built up from a
symbol describing the error and a sequence of OpenMath objects. For
example:
\begin{verbatim}
  <OMOBJ>
    <OME>
      <OMS name="unexpected_symbol" cd="error1">
      <OMS name="sine" cd="transc1">
    </OME>
  </OMOBJ>
\end{verbatim}
represents the error which might be generated when an application sees
a symbol it doesn't recognise from a CD it thought it knew about.

\subsection{OpenMath Encodings}

We have already seen some examples of the XML encoding, but it is by
no means the only encoding. In the past there was a functional
encoding (which looked like Lisp) and an SGML encoding which evolved
into the current XML. Both of these are now obsolete, but there is
still a binary encoding described in the standard , which is much more
compact than the XML one.

In fact the XML encoding is not \verb|100%| XML. When XML was in its infancy
the developers of OpenMath realised that it might become significant
and decided to add some XML-like features to the SGML encoding so that
an an OpenMath object could be encoded as valid XML. Thus it is
currently the case that any well-formed OpenMath object encoded using
the XML encoding as described in the standard is a valid XML
document. However, if one uses standard XML tools to generate an
OpenMath object in the XML encoding from the DTD given in chapter 4 of
the standard, it is possible that the result will not be valid
OpenMath, although in practice this is highly unlikely. To cover all
the possibilities allowed by XML would make it much more complicated
to write an application to read any OpenMath object from
scratch. Whether to adopt XML completely remains a hot topic of debate
within the OpenMath community!

Generally speaking, it is not intended that the existing encodings
should be readable by a human user or writable by hand. It is
desirable that they be compact and it is also desirable that they be
linear, but neither of these is a requirement. It is a property of
encodings that it is possible to convert between them with no loss of
information.  

\subsection{Content Dictionaries}

Content Dictionaries (or CDs for short) are the most important, and
the most interesting, aspect of OpenMath because they define the
meaning of the objects being transmitted. A CD is a collection of
related symbols and their definitions, encoded in an XML
format. Defining the meaning of a symbol is not a trivial task, and
even referring to well-known references can be fraught with pitfalls
Formal definitions and properties can be very useful but
time-consuming to produce and verbose, not to mention difficult to get
right. A symbol definition in an OpenMath CD consists of the following
pieces of information:
\begin{verbatim}
    the symbol name;
    a description in plain text;
    optionally, a set of this symbol's properties in plain text 
       (Commented Mathematical Properties, or CMPs);
    optionally, a set of this symbol's properties encoded in OpenMath 
       (Formal Mathematical Properties, or FMPs);
    optionally, one or more examples of its use (encoded in OpenMath).
\end{verbatim}
In practice the CMPs and FMPs can come as pairs, and often serve in
the place of examples.

A very simple instance of a CD definition is:
\begin{verbatim}
<CDDefinition>
<Name> log </Name>

<Description> 
This symbol represents a binary log function; the first argument is
the base, to which the second argument is log'ed.
It is defined in Abramowitz and Stegun, Handbook of Mathematical
Functions, section 4.1
</Description>
<CMP>
  a^b = c implies log_a c = b
</CMP>
<FMP>
  <OMOBJ>
    <OMA>
      <OMS cd="logic1" name="implies"/>
      <OMA>
        <OMS cd="relation1" name="eq"/>

        <OMA>
          <OMS cd="arith1" name="power"/>
          <OMV name="a"/>
          <OMV name="b"/>
        </OMA>
        <OMV name="c"/>
      </OMA>
      <OMA>
        <OMS cd="relation1" name="eq"/>

        <OMA>
          <OMS cd="transc1" name="log"/>
          <OMV name="a"/>
          <OMV name="c"/>
        </OMA>
        <OMV name="b"/>
      </OMA>
    </OMA>
  </OMOBJ>

</FMP>

<Example>
log 100 to base 10 (which is 2).
<OMOBJ>
  <OMA>
    <OMS cd="transc1" name="log"/>
    <OMF dec="10"/>
    <OMF dec="100"/>
  </OMA>
</OMOBJ>
</Example>

</CDDefinition>
\end{verbatim}

Another example would be to print the list
\begin{verbatim}
   [ 1, 1/2 ]
\end{verbatim}
as
\begin{verbatim}
<OMOBJ>
 <OMA>
  <OMS cd="list1" name="list"/>
  <OMI>1</OMI>
  <OMA>
   <OMS cd="nums1" name="rational"/>
   <OMI>1</OMI>
   <OMI>2</OMI>
  </OMA>
 </OMA>
</OMOBJ>
\end{verbatim}

This provides a symbol to represent the log function by giving a
pointer to a standard reference book. It provides the property that:
\[ a^b=c \rightarrow log_a(c)=b \]
both as plain text and as OpenMath, and also gives an example of how
the symbol is used.

CDs usually consist of related symbols and collections of related CDs
can be grouped together, for convenience, as CD Groups. One very
important CD Group is that corresponding to the content part of
MathML. 

It is possible to associate extra information with CDs, in particular
type information. Since there are many type systems available, each of
which has its own strengths and advocates, the OpenMath community does
not mandate any single system. Simple signatures can be encoded using
the Simple Type System, while more formal definitions are possible
using the Extended Calculus of Constructorss. Other associated
information can include style sheets for rendering OpenMath symbols in
MathML, and mathematical definitions to be used by formal logic
systems.

Given the evolutionary nature of mathematics, it is clear that the set
of CDs should be forever growing and never complete. Currently there
are CDs for high-school mathematics, linear algebra, polynomials and
group theory to name a few, and new contributions are always
welcome. There is no requirement that applications use the standard
set of CDs and it is often very useful to design a "private" CD for a
specific purpose.

\subsection{OpenMath in Action}

There is no definitive way in which OpenMath should be used, as the
protocol has been designed to be as flexible as possible. Nevertheless
many OpenMath applications share common characteristics which we shall
discuss here.

Suppose that we wish to have two applications communicating by sending
OpenMath objects to each other, e.g. a client program and a
computational server. It is unlikely that the internal data structures
used by the applications will be OpenMath, and so translation between
the internal representations and OpenMath (almost certainly OpenMath
encodings rather than objects) will have to take place. The piece of
software which does this is usually referred to as a phrase-book.

It is possible to write a generic phrase-book which can handle any
piece of OpenMath, but applications where this makes sense are few and
far between. In practice an OpenMath phrase book will usually only
handle a fixed set of CDs (and hence a fixed set of symbols). What
``handle'' means will vary from case to case: a computer algebra system
will usually try and evaluate its input and return a result or an
error, while a typesetter will print its input according to some
rendering rules and not return anything. OpenMath carefully avoids
defining what the ``right'' behaviour is in a given circumstance, and
leaves that up to the phrase-book writer. Indeed it is quite possible
that a piece of software could have multiple phrase-books associated
with it for different purposes. OpenMath symbols should not be
regarded as verbs since they are used to construct objects rather than
to send commands, and the presence of both nouns and verbs in a CD
(e.g. ``integral'' and ``integrate'') is strongly discouraged.

Writing a phrase-book may be non-trivial, and requires an
understanding of the semantics of the underlying software. An OpenMath
object may not map directly into a private object and vice-versa, for
example in some systems a rational number might have to be represented
by a float, or a sparse matrix by a dense one.

The OpenMath standard includes a section on compliance, which
describes the behaviour of an OpenMath application when certain errors
occur. It also insists that all compliant software has the capability
to use the XML encoding, to guarantee a degree of interoperability. 
This is an area where the standard is expected to evolve as more 
OpenMath applications become available.

\section{Technical Details}

This chapter describes the Axiom implementation of the 
OpenMath project\cite{Dalm97}
at INRIA. The code enables the exchange of OpenMath objects
between two processes and more generally the input and output of OpenMath
objects. First we describe the library API and then we implement the
functions used by Axiom.
\section{The Structure of the API}
The library and its API are logically structured in four parts:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Functions that deal with {\sl devices}, the abstraction
from which OpenMath objects are read and written to.
\item Functions that read from and write to OpenMath devices. These functions 
use a simple model that read and write tokens.
\item Functions that create I/O  structures to be used by devices, so that,
for example, an OpenMath object can be read from a file or a socket. This part
is extensible by the user. 
\item Functions that deal with interprocess communication.
\end{itemize} 

\section{OpenMath Expressions}

\subsection{Expressions}

The library understands the following kinds of basic OpenMath expressions:
\begin{itemize} 
\item integers
\item double precision  floating-point numbers (64 bits, following IEEE 754)
\item byte arrays
\item character strings
\item symbols
\item variables
\end{itemize} 
and the four kinds of constructions: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item applications $e_0(e_1, \ldots e_n)$
\item errors $s(e_1, \ldots e_n)$
\item binders $e_1, (v_1, \ldots v_n), e_2 $
\item attributed expressions $[s_1 e_1, \ldots s_n e_n] e$
\end{itemize} 
where $e_i$ are OpenMath expressions, $v_i$ are OpenMath variables and $s$ and
$s_i$ are OpenMath symbols. 

\subsection{Symbols}

Symbols are constructed from a content dictionary (abbreviated as CD
in the sequel) and a name.  A content dictionary is identified by its
name.  The API permits the creation of any symbol in any content
dictionary: there is nothing that prevents creating symbols that do
not belong to a known CD.

\subsection{Encoding and Decoding OpenMath Expressions}

An OpenMath object is encoded as a sequence of bytes that is read and
written sequentially. The library views this sequence as a stream of
tokens.  Expressions are linearized in a way that looks like Lisp with
typed parenthesis. For example, the linearization of the application
of $S$ to $E_1\ldots E_n$ is:
\begin{itemize} 
\item indicating that this is an application (a ``begin application'' token)
\item linearizing $S$
\item linearizing $E_1$,\ldots $E_n$
\item indicating that all arguments have been given (an ``end application''
token) 
\end{itemize} 

The other constructions are linearized the same way (each one with its
own begin and end tokens).  Note that there is no explicit arity
indication so that we don't have to introduce a special mechanism when
we don't know beforehand how many arguments there are.

To give attributes to an expression, the attributes and their
associated values are put before the expression. To give the
attributes $a_i$ with values $v_i$ (where $a_i$ are symbols and $v_i$
are OpenMath expressions) to an expression $E$ the process is:
\begin{itemize} 
\item put a ``begin attributed expression'' token
\item put a ``begin attribute pairs'' token
\item put the symbol $a_1$ followed by the linearization of $v_1$ {\sl etc}
\item put an ``end attribute pairs'' token
\item linearize $E$
\item put an ``end attributed expression'' token

\end{itemize} 

Decoding is done by first querying the type of the next OpenMath token and
then invoking the right function to get this particular kind of token.

\section{Big Integers}

The library supports big integers that can potentially be given in
various formats. The {\tt OMBigIntType} describes the different
possible formats.
\begin{verbatim} 
typedef enum OMbigIntType {
  OMBIunknown = 0,  /* this is base 10, digits in normal order */
  OMBIbase10        /* this is base 16, digits in normal order (MSB) */
  OMbigIntBase16
} OMbigIntType;
\end{verbatim} 

\section{Functions Dealing with OpenMath Devices}

OpenMath expressions are read and written through {\sl devices}.
Basically, an OpenMath device has an associated encoding and an I/O
method.  There are basically two encodings defined and implemented.
The first one is a human readable and writable one that can be used
for example as the encoding for sending OpenMath objects via e-mail or
storing OpenMath objects to files.  This encoding is SGML compatible
in the sense that it can be used to represent OpenMath objects in SGML
texts. I has an XML variant.  The second encoding is a binary one that
can be used when compactness and speed of encoding and decoding is
important.  The encodings are defined by the {\tt OMencodingType} type
which is an enumerated type defined as
\begin{verbatim} 
typedef enum OMencodingType 
   { OMencodingUnknown, 
     OMencodingBinary, 
     OMencodingSGML, 
     OMencodingXML} OMencodingType;
\end{verbatim} 
{\tt OMencodingUnknown} is to be used when creating a device that does not
know which kind of encoding will be used. It must be used only for input
devices.

A device is created with the following function, given an encoding and
an appropriate I/O method:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\tt OMdev OMmakeDevice(OMencodingType encoding, OMIO IO)}
\end{itemize} 
Devices are closed with the following function
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\tt void OMcloseDevice(OMdev dev)}
\end{itemize} 

Whether a device could be used both for reading and writing is entirely
dependent on its I/O method. 

The user can define its own I/O method as a function returning
an {\tt OMIO} object. This could enable him, for example, to use an
existing transport protocol to exchange OpenMath expressions or to implement
cut-and-paste of OpenMath expression by writing I/O structures that input and
output to strings. The I/O section describes the available I/O structures in
the library.

An {\tt OMdev} object is a pointer to a structure that contains a lot
of state. Almost all functions taking an {\tt OMdev} object modify
it. Likewise, an {\tt OMIO} object carries a lot of state.

\section{Functions to Write OpenMath Expressions to Devices}

\subsection{Beginning and Ending Objects}

The following two functions mark the beginning and end of an OpenMath object.
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputObject(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndObject(OMdev dev)+
\end{itemize} 
These functions should be called before and after an OpenMath object
in constructed in a device.  In particular, the \verb+OMputEndObject+
function insures that the object has been completely written if any
buffering was used.

\subsection{Writing Basic Objects}

Basic OpenMath objects are written using these functions:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputInt32(OMdev dev, int n)+
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
OMstatus OMputBigInt(OMdev dev, const char *data, int len, int sign, 
                     OMbigIntType format)
\end{verbatim}
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputFloat64(OMdev dev, double *f)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputByteArray(OMdev dev, const char *data, int len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputString(OMdev dev, const char *s)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputVar(OMdev dev, const char *name)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputSymbol(OMdev dev, const char *cd, const char *name)+
\end{itemize} 

The {\tt char *} arguments of {\tt OMputString}, {\tt OMputVar} and {\tt
OMputSymbol} are null-terminated strings. There are other functions that
accept non null-terminated arrays of characters with their length.
These are 
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputStringN(OMdev dev, const char *str, int len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputVarN(OMdev dev, const char *var, int len)+
\item
\begin{verbatim}
OMstatus OMputSymbolN(OMdev dev, const char *cd, int clen, 
                      const char *name, int nlen)
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize} 

The format for the {\tt data} argument of the {\tt OMputBigInt} function is
given by {\tt format}. When {\tt format} is {\tt OMBIbase10}, it is the
sequence of character of its base 10 representation without sign (most
significant digit first). The sign of the big integer is given by the 
{\tt sign} argument that should be an integer greater or
equal to zero for a positive integer and less than zero for a negative
one. For example, the following line outputs the value of $20!$ to {\tt dev}:
\begin{verbatim} 
OMputBigInt(dev, "265252859812191058636308480000000", 33, 1, OMBIbase10);
\end{verbatim} 

\subsection{Writing Structured Objects}

The following functions are used to mark the beginning and end of the
structured objects. They should be called in nested pairs, correctly
bracketed:  
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputApp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndApp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputAttr(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndAttr(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputBind(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndBind(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputBVar(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndBVar(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputAtp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndAtp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputError(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputEndError(OMdev dev)+
\end{itemize} 

Here is an example showing how to use these functions to output $\sin x + y$,
where $x$ and $y$ are represented as variables and $\sin$ is the symbol whose
name is {\tt sin} in the {\tt Basic} content dictionary. This can be done
using the following sequence:
\begin{verbatim} 
OMputObject(dev);
OMputApp(dev);
  OMputSymbol(dev, "Basic", "sin");
  OMputApp(dev)
    OMputSymbol(dev, "Basic", "+");
    OMputVar(dev, "x");
    OMputVar(dev, "y");
  OMputEndApp(dev);
OMputEndApp(dev);
OMputEndObject(dev);
\end{verbatim} 

\section{Functions to Extract OpenMath Expressions from Devices}

\subsection{Testing the type of the current token}

The first step in decoding an expression from a device is to call the 
{\tt OMgetType} function
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetType(OMdev dev, OMtokenType *type)+
\end{itemize} 
so that the correct function can be called to recover the current token.

{\tt OMgetType} returns via its {\tt type} argument an {\tt OMtokenType}
object indicating the type of the next object to be read from the device. 
{\tt OMtokenType} is an enumerated type defined as 
\begin{verbatim} 
typedef enum OMtokenType {
  OMtokenUnknown, /* error catching trick */
  OMtokenInt32,
  OMtokenBigInt,
  OMtokenFloat64,
  OMtokenByteArray,
  OMtokenVar,
  OMtokenString,
  OMtokenSymbol,
  OMtokenComment,
  OMtokenApp,    OMtokenEndApp,
  OMtokenAttr,   OMtokenEndAttr,
  OMtokenAtp,    OMtokenEndAtp,
  OMtokenError,  OMtokenEndError,
  OMtokenObject, OMtokenEndObject,
  OMtokenBind,   OMtokenEndBind, 
  OMtokenBVar,   OMtokenEndBVar,
} OMtokenType;
\end{verbatim} 
Note that the type of the current token can be tested multiple times. Two
successive calls to {\tt OMgetType} will always return the same result if no
other {\tt OMget...} function was called in between. 

\subsection{Extracting the current token}

\noindent
The following functions are used to read the basic OpenMath objects from
devices: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetInt32(OMdev dev, int *i)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetFloat64(OMdev dev, double *d)+
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
OMstatus OMgetBigInt(OMdev dev, char **data, int *len, int *sign, 
                     OMbigIntType *fmt)
\end{verbatim}
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
OMstatus OMgetBigIntN(OMdev dev, char *data, int len, int *sign, 
                      OMbigIntType *fmt)
\end{verbatim}
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetByteArray(OMdev dev, char **data, int *len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetByteArrayN(OMdev dev, char *data, int len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetString(OMdev dev, char **str)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetStringN(OMdev dev, char *str, int len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetVar(OMdev dev, char **var)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetVarN(OMdev dev, char *var, int len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetSymbol(OMdev dev, char **cd, char **name)+
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
OMstatus OMgetSymbolN(OMdev dev,char *cd,int clen,char *name,int nlen)
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize} 
The functions that return variable size data exist in two versions. A simple
version that does the necessary memory allocation itself 
(using {\tt OMmalloc}) and a
version (suffixed with {\tt N}) that lets the user do the allocation itself.
The size of the needed area can be determined with the following function:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+int OMgetLength(OMdev dev)+ returns the length of the next
object. 
\end{itemize} 
that works for big integers, byte arrays, strings and variables. For symbols,
the following function returns both the length of the content dictionary name
and the length of the symbol name:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetSymbolLength(OMdev dev, int *clen, int *nlen)+
\end{itemize} 

When the current token does not carry any data i.e. when 
{\tt OMgetType} returns a marker, i.e. one of:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt OMtokenApp},
\item {\tt OMtokenEndApp},
\item {\tt OMtokenAttr},
\item {\tt OM tokenEndAttr},
\item {\tt OMtokenAtp},
\item {\tt OMtokenEndAtp},
\item {\tt OMtokenError},
\item {\tt OMtokenEndError},
\item {\tt OMtokenObject},
\item {\tt OMtokenEndObject},
\item {\tt OMtokenBind},
\item {\tt OMtokenEndBind},
\item {\tt OMtokenBVar}
\item {\tt OMtokenEndBVar} 
\end{itemize}
it is necessary to call the correct function to remove the marker. The
available functions are

\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetObject(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndObject(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetApp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndApp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetAttr(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndAttr(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetAtp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndAtp(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetBind(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndBind(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetBVar(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndBVar(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetError(OMdev dev)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetEndError(OMdev dev)+
\end{itemize} 

All the previous functions return {\tt OMsuccess} when they succeed. When
they return something else, there has been a problem such as calling the
wrong function ({\tt OMgetApp} when there is not a ``beginning of
application'' mark) or a system error. 

The sequence of calls to read an expression is thus completely similar
(if we omit the calls to {\tt OMgetType}) to the sequence of calls to
write the expression. For example, the previous expression ($\sin x + y$)
can be recovered via the sequence:
\begin{verbatim} 
OMgetObject(dev);
OMgetApp(dev);
  OMgetSymbol(dev, ...);
  OMgetApp(dev);
    OMgetSymbol(dev, ...);
    OMgetVar(dev, ...);
    OMgetVar(dev, ...);
  OMgetEndApp(dev);
OMgetEndApp(dev);
OMgetEndObject(dev);
\end{verbatim} 

\verb+OMgetInt32(OMdev dev, int *i)+ returns the integer through its {\tt i}
argument. 

\begin{verbatim}
OMgetBigInt(OMdev dev, char **data, int *len, int *sign, OMbigIntType *fmt)
\end{verbatim}
returns the data corresponding to the big integer in {\tt data}, its length
in {\tt len}, its sign in {\tt sign} and its format in {\tt fmt}.

\begin{verbatim}
OMgetBigIntN(OMdev dev, char *data, int len, int *sign, OMbigIntType *fmt)
\end{verbatim}
copies the data corresponding to the big integer in {\tt data} buffer that
should be (at least) {\tt len} characters long. The sign and format are
returned in the {\tt sign} and {\tt fmt} arguments.

\verb+OMgetByteArray(OMdev dev, char **data, int *len)+ returns the byte
array through its {\tt data} argument. Its length is returned via the 
{\tt len} argument.

\verb+OMgetByteArrayN(OMdev dev, char *data, int len)+ copies the byte array
in the {\tt data} buffer that should be (at least) {\tt len} characters
long. 

\verb+OMgetString(OMdev dev, char **str)+ returns the string trough its 
{\tt str} argument.

\verb+OMgetStringN(OMdev dev, char *str, int len)+ copies the string
in the {\tt str} buffer whose length should be (at least) {\tt len}.
If {\tt len} is greater than the actual length of the string, a null
character is added at the end of {\tt str}.

\verb+OMgetVar(OMdev dev, char **var)+ returns the name of the
variable (as a null-terminated string) in its {\tt var} argument

\verb+OMgetVarN(OMdev dev, char *var, int len)+ copies the name of the
variable in the {\tt var} buffer, whose length should be (at least) 
{\tt len}. 
If {\tt len} is greater than the actual length of the variable name, a null 
character is added at the end of {\tt var}.

\verb+OMgetSymbol(OMdev dev, char **cd, char **name)+ returns the content
dictionary and the name of the symbol through the {\tt cd} and {\tt name}
arguments. 

\verb+OMgetSymbolN(OMdev dev, char *cd, int clen, char *name, int nlen)+ 
copies the content dictionary and the name of the symbols in the {\tt cd} and
{\tt name} buffers. {\tt cd} should be at least {\tt clen} character long and
{\tt name} should be at least {\tt nlen} long. When there is enough room
(based on {\tt clen} or {\tt nlen}) a null character is added after the last
character of the name ({\tt cd} or {\tt name}).

\section{Comments in the SGML/XML Encodings}

The library can also output and read comments (SGML/XML comments) with the
following functions:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputComment(OMdev dev, char *comment)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMputCommentN(OMdev dev, char *comment, int len)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetComment(OMdev dev, char **comment)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMgetCommentN(OMdev dev, char *comment, int len)+
\end{itemize} 

By default, comments are silently ignored by the library when reading
OpenMath objects (and writing them using the binary encoding).
The function 
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMbool OMignoreComment(OMdev dev, OMbool set)+
\end{itemize} 
changes this behaviour. When called with {\tt OMfalse}, comments are passed
to the application: the {\tt OMgetType} function will return
{\tt OMtokenComment} when the current token is a comment and the 
{\tt OMgetComment} or {\tt OMgetCommentN} functions should be used to get the
comments. When {\tt OMignoreComment} is called with {\tt OMtrue}, comments
are ignored.

\section{\enspace{}I/O Functions for Devices}

We provide four functions that produce {\tt OMIO} objects for
devices. These functions provide I/O through the {\tt stdio} library
(on {\tt FILE} object), file descriptors and character strings.

\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMIO OMmakeIOFile(FILE *f)+ associates the device with the
file pointer {\tt f}.
\item \verb+OMIO OMmakeIOfd(int fd)+ associates the device with the file
descriptor {\tt fd}.
\item \verb+OMIO OMmakeIOHandle(HANDLE handle)+ associates the device with a 
file handle *Windows specific version of \verb+OMmakeIOfd()+.{\tt fd}.
\item \verb+OMIO OMmakeIOString(char **s)+  associates the device with a 
string.
\end{itemize} 
For example, the following code opens a device that reads from standard
input: 
\begin{verbatim} 
dev = OMmakeDevice(OMencodingSGML, OMmakeIOFile(stdin));
\end{verbatim} 

The {\tt OMmakeIOString} builds an input device that reads from a string
or an output device that writes to a string. For input, {\tt s} must point to
a character string (null terminated). For output, {\tt s} will point to a
string allocated by the library (note that the string {\tt s} points to can
be reallocated by the library).

\section{\enspace{}Communications}

A communication layer can be put above the device layer.  In fact, the
I/O structure in a device provides all the necessary support to use
any transmission or communication means.  This library directly
provides some connection-oriented, client-server facilities (based on
{\sc tcp}).

A set of functions are used to set up connections. Connections are described
by the {\tt OMconn} type. An {\tt OMconn} is a (pointer to a) structure with
two user-accessible fields {\tt in} and {\tt out}. {\tt in} is a pointer to a
device to be used for input. {\tt out} is pointer to a device to be used for
output. These devices use the binary encoding.

An {\tt OMconn} object is made with the following function:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMconn OMmakeConn(int timeout)+
\end{itemize} 
where {\tt timeout} is a timeout for the connection, expressed in
milliseconds. 

\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMdev OMconnIn(OMconn conn)+ returns the input device
associated with the connection.
\item \verb+OMdev OMconnOut(OMconn conn)+ returns the output device
associated with the connection.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Functions to Initiate an {\tt OMconn}}

The functions we provide can be divided in two classes. The first one
simply establishes an interprocess communication using {\sc IP} addresses.
The second one provides functions that can be used to launch a server. 
The addresses used are then generated by the library.

\subsubsection{Simple Connections Functions}

The following functions allow a client OpenMath application to contact an
OpenMath server at a specified address:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMconnTCP(OMconn conn, char *machine, int port)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMconnUnix(OMconn conn, char *file)+
\end{itemize} 
These functions first physically establish the connection. Then, they enter
negotiation with the server (they send the first message). When they return,
the negotiation is finished and the devices in the {\tt conn} argument are
ready. 

On the server side, the following functions provide bindings at specified
addresses and take care of the negotiation:
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMbindTCP(OMconn conn, int port)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMbindUnix(OMconn conn, char *file)+
\end{itemize} 

All four the previous  functions block until the connection is established
(and negotiation is over) or the timeout of the {\tt conn} argument is
reached.

The following function returns the file descriptor associated with a device.
This is intended to be used when there is a need to poll the device (through
the {\tt select} or {\tt poll} system calls).
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+OMdeviceFd(OMdev dev)+
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Functions that Launch Servers}

These functions provide the same functionalities for launching a
server that were provided in the {\sc asap} library.

In this model, the client calls {\tt OMlaunch} with a machine name
{\tt mach} and a string {\tt cmd} that is executed via {\tt rsh} on
machine {\tt mach} as a shell command line. This command is supposed
to launch the server program. The command is executed in an
environment (in the {\sc unix} sense) where some variables are
associated with an address on the machine that runs the client. The
server can then connect to the client with the {\tt OMserveClient}
function.

If the machine name is {\tt localhost}, the command is started on the
same machine (without calling {\tt rsh}).

\begin{itemize} 
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
OMstatus OMlaunchEnv(OMconn conn, char *machine, char *command, char *env)
\end{verbatim}
\item \verb+OMstatus OMlaunch(OMconn conn, char *machine, char *command)+
\item \verb+OMstatus OMserveClient(OMconn conn)+
\end{itemize} 

The environment variables sent to the server (launched program) are
{\verb+OM_CALLER_UNIX_SOCKET+} (when a local connection is required) and 
{\verb+OM_CALLER_MACHINE+} and {\verb+OM_CALLER_PORT+} (for internet
connections).

The {\tt OMlaunchEnv} function enables the command to be run with a
particular environment (in the {\sc unix} sense). For example to run a
{\tt plot} server on the {\tt kama} machine, we could use a piece of code
such as 
\begin{verbatim} 
conn = OMmakeConn(2000);
OMlaunchEnv(conn, "kama", "plot", "DISPLAY=rati:0 PATH=/users/bin");
\end{verbatim} 

\subsubsection{Termination}

\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+OMstatus OMconnClose(OMconn conn)+
\end{itemize} 

\section{\enspace{}Parameters}

The library internally uses three functions that can be supplied by the user.
\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+extern void *(*OMmalloc) (size_t size)+
\item \verb+extern void *(*OMrealloc) (void *ptr, size_t size)+
\item \verb+extern void (*OMfree) (void *ptr)+
\end{itemize} 

\begin{itemize} 
\item {\tt OMmalloc} is used for all memory allocations in the library. 
The default value is the {\tt malloc} function.
\item {\tt OMfree} is used for deallocations. The default value is the 
{\tt free} function. 
\item {\tt OMfatal} is invoked when a fatal error is detected in the library
(for example when memory allocation failed or when an inconsistency is
detected in the library code data structures). The default value just does an
{\tt exit}.
\end{itemize}
{\tt OMfatal} is declared as 
{\tt \verb+extern void (*OMfatal)(OMstatus status)+}. 
All memory allocations and deallocations in the library are done through the
{\tt OMmalloc} and {\tt OMfree} functions.

\section{\enspace{}Miscellaneous Functions and Variables}

\begin{itemize} 
\item \verb+char *OMstatusToString(OMstatus status)+ make a status into a
human readable string.
\item \verb+char *OMtokenTypeToString(OMtokenType ttype)+ makes a
{\tt tokenType} into a human readable string.
\item \verb+OMencodingType OMgetDeviceEncoding(OMdev dev)+ returns the
encoding actually used by the device.
\item \verb+char *OMlibDynamicInfo(void)+
\item \verb+extern const char *OMlibVersion+ is the version of the library.
\item \verb+extern const char *OMlibInfo+ contains some textual information
about the library.
\end{itemize}

\section{\enspace{}Axiom OpenMath stub functions}
These stub functions will eventually be expanded to handle OpenMath.
See the OpenMathDevice domain in Volume 10.3. Note that the argument
list for the Spad functions does not always match the argument list
specified in the OpenMath specification.

There are 4 known OpenMath encodings which are set up in the OpenMathEncoding
domain in Volume 10.3.
\begin{itemize}
\item Unknown 
\item Binary
\item XML
\item SGML
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Axiom specific functions}
This is used in OpenMathPackage in Volume 10.4.
\begin{verbatim}
(read OMdev)              -> LispObject
(listCDs)                 -> List(String)
(listSymbols)             -> List(String)
(supportsCD cd)           -> Boolean
(supportsSymbol cd name)  -> Boolean
\end{verbatim}

\defun{om-Read}{om-Read}
Read an OpenMath object from dev.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-Read}
(defun om-Read (dev)
 (declare (ignore dev)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-listCDs}{om-listCDs}
Lists all of the CDs supported by Axiom.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-listCDs}
(defun om-listCDs ())

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-listSymbols}{om-listSymbols}
Lists all the symbols in CD
\begin{chunk}{defun om-listSymbols}
(defun om-listSymbols ())

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-supportsCD}{om-supportsCD}
Return true if Axiom supports this CD.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-supportsCD}
(defun om-supportsCD (cd)
 (declare (ignore cd)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-supportsSymbol}{om-supportsSymbol}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-supportsSymbol}
(defun om-supportsSymbol (cd name)
 (declare (ignore cd name)))

\end{chunk}

\subsection{Lisp conversion functions}
The lisp conversion functions are:
\begin{verbatim}
 (toDev                 LispObject)                   -> OMdev
 (fromDev               OMdev)                        -> LispObject
 (toStatus              LispObject)                   -> LispObject
 (fromStatus            OMstatus)                     -> LispObject

 (cStringFromLispString LispObject)                   -> LispObject
\end{verbatim}

\defun{om-setDevEncoding}{om-setDevEncoding}
This sets the encoding used for reading or writeing OpenMath objects to
or from dev to enc.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-setDevEncoding}
(defun om-setDevEncoding (dev enc)
 (declare (ignore dev enc)))

\end{chunk}

\subsection{Device manipulation functions}
\begin{verbatim}
(openFileDev LispObject, ints, ...)              -> LispObject
(openStrDev  LispObject, LispObject, LispObject) -> LispObject
(closeDev    LispObject, LispObject)             -> LispObject
\end{verbatim}

\defun{om-openFileDev}{om-openFileDev}
This opens file fname for reading or writing OpenMath objects.
The mode can be ``r'' for read, ``w'' for write, or ''a'' for append.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-openFileDev}
(defun om-openFileDev (fname fmode enc)
 (declare (ignore fname fmode enc)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-openStringDev}{om-openStringDev}
This opens the string str for reading and writing OpenMath objects in 
encoding enc.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-openStringDev}
(defun om-openStringDev (str enc)
 (declare (ignore str enc)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-closeDev}{om-closeDev}
This closes dev, flushing output if necessary.
\begin{chunk}{defun om-closeDev}
(defun om-closeDev (dev)
 (declare (ignore dev)))

\end{chunk}

\subsection{Connection manipulation functions}
These are covered in the OpenMathConnection domain in Volume 10.3.
\begin{verbatim}
 (makeConn      LispObject, LispObject) -> LispObject
 (closeConn     LispObject, LispObject) -> LispObject
 (getConnInDev  LispObject, LispObject) -> LispObject
 (getConnOutDev LispObject, LispObject) -> LispObject
\end{verbatim}

\defun{om-makeConn}{om-makeConn}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-makeConn}
(defun om-makeConn (conn)
 (declare (ignore conn)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-closeConn}{om-closeConn}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-closeConn}
(defun om-closeConn (conn)
 (declare (ignore conn)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-getConnInDev}{om-getConnInDev}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-getConnInDev}
(defun om-getConnInDev (conn)
 (declare (ignore conn)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-getConnOutDev}{om-getConnOutDev}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-getConnOutDev}
(defun om-getConnOutDev (conn)
 (declare (ignore conn)))

\end{chunk}

\subsection{Client/Server functions}
These are covered in the OpenMathConnection domain in Volume 10.3.
See OMconn.h
\begin{verbatim}
(bindTCP    LispObject, LispObject, LispObject) -> LispObject
(connectTCP LispObject, int, ...)               -> LispObject
\end{verbatim}

\defun{om-bindTCP}{om-bindTCP}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-bindTCP}
(defun om-bindTCP (conn port)
 (declare (ignore conn port)))

\end{chunk}

\defun{om-connectTCP}{om-connectTCP}
\begin{chunk}{defun om-connectTCP}
(defun om-connectTCP (conn host port)
 (declare (ignore conn host port)))

\end{chunk}

\subsection{Device input/output functions}
Most of these functions are in the OpenMathDevice domain in Volume 10.3.
The only exception seems to be the om-stringPtrToString and 
om-stringToStringPtr functions which are called in the domains that
export primitives. Currently these are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complex (10.3)
\item DoubleFloat (10.3)
\item Float (10.3)
\item Fraction (10.3)
\item Integer (10.3)
\item List (10.3)
\item SingleInteger (10.3)
\item String (10.3)
\item Symbol (10.3)
\item ExpressionToOpenMath (10.4)
\item OpenMathPackage (10.4)
\end{itemize}

Note that putSymbol2 is not implemented.

MONITOR                                                                
                                                                       
This file contains a set of function for monitoring the execution      
of the functions in a file. It constructs a hash table that contains   
the function name as the key and monitor-data structures as the value  
                                                                       
The technique is to use a :cond parameter on trace to call the         
monitor-incr function to incr the count every time a function is called

*monitor-nrlibs*                               LIST of STRING
   list of nrlib filenames that are monitored
*monitor-domains*                              LIST of STRING
   list of domains to monitor-report (default is all exposed domains)
monitor-data                                   STRUCTURE               
   is the defstruct name of records in the table                       
   name is the first field and is the name of the monitored function   
   count contains a count of times the function was called             
   monitorp is a flag that skips counting if nil, counts otherwise     
   sourcefile is the name of the file that contains the source code

\chapter{HyperDoc}
Hyperdoc works by building up a page ``description'' which consists
of a list of items. Each item is itself a list whose first element is
a tag. The htMakePage1 routine walks the list of items,
dispatching on the tag (called itemType), to create the final page.

Pages are constructed with a latex-like syntax. The valid syntax
values are in the primitiveHtCommands list.

Each page is an 8 part list, of which the description is the last
item. See HTPage Layout for more details.

Pages can also be constructed by code. For example, the page found by
\begin{verbatim}
   Basic Commands -> Matrix
\end{verbatim}
is constructed by a call to bcReadMatrix.
This routine sets the page title htInitPage, 
sets up the EXIT button handler htpSetProperty, 
constructs a page descriptions which is passes to htMakePage, 
and then calls htShowPage 
to display the result.

\defun{getHtMacroItem}{Get new command name and number of args}

\end{verbatim}
This function returns a pair whose CAR is the new command name
and whose CDR is the number of arguments. If there are zero arguments
the brackets and number will not appear.

However brackets can appear in the new command so we need to fix
the original code to handle this new case. We set up a wall
starting after the first closing brace.

\section{Handling Axiom command execution}

%\begin{center}
%{\bf {\large{Basic Command}}}
%\vskip 0.25cm
%\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{ps/v5bcbasiccommands.eps}
%\end{center}

The {\tt bcGen} function is called with a string which will be passed
to the Axiom command line. For example, the path 
\begin{verbatim}
  Calculus -> Differentiate -> -> Continue -> Do it
\end{verbatim}
will generate the Axiom command line
\begin{verbatim}
  differentiate(sin(x*y),[x,y],[1,2])
\end{verbatim}

\defun{bcGen}{Basic Command result page}
\calls{bcGen}{concat}
\calls{bcGen}{htInitPage}
\calls{bcGen}{htMakePage}
\calls{bcGen}{htShowPage}
\sig{bcGen}{Command}{nil}
\begin{chunk}{defun bcGen}
(defun |bcGen| (command)
 (let (string)
  (|htInitPage| "Basic Command" nil)
  (setq string
    (if (< (length command) 50)
       (concat "{\\centerline{\\tt " command " }}")
       (concat "{\\tt " command " }")))
  (|htMakePage|
    (list 
     '(|text| 
   "{Here is the Axiom command you could have issued to compute this result:}" 
        "\\vspace{2}\\newline ")
       (cons '|text| string) ))
  (|htMakeDoitButton| "Do It" command)
  (|htShowPage|)))

\end{chunk}

The {\tt htMakeDoitButton} displays the Axiom command to be executed
on a page. Pushing the {\bf "Do it"} invokes {\tt doDoitButton}

\defun{htMakeDoitButton}{htMakeDoitButton}
\sig{doDoitButton}{String,Command}{nil}
\begin{chunk}{defun htMakeDoitButton}
(defun |htMakeDoitButton| (label command)
 (declare (special |$curPage|))
  (cond
   ((equal label "Do It")
    (|bcHt| 
"\\newline\\vspace{1}\\centerline{\\lispcommand{\\DoItBitmap}{(|doDoitButton| "))
    (t
     (|bcHt| 
      (list "\\newline\\vspace{1}\\centerline{\\lispcommand{\\box{" label
         "}}{(|doDoitButton| "))))
  (|bcHt| (|htpName| |$curPage|))
  (|bcHt| (list " \"" (|htEscapeString| command) "\""))
  (|bcHt| ")}}")
  (|bcHt| "\\vspace{2}{Select \\  \\UpButton{} \\  to go back one page.}")
  (|bcHt| 
    "\\newline{Select \\  \\ExitButton{QuitPage} \\  to remove this window.}"))

\end{chunk}

The {\tt doDoitButton} invokes {\tt executeInterpreterCommand}.
Why this intermediate function exists is unclear.

\defun{doDoitButton}{Execute a command from Hyperdoc}
\sig{doDoitButton}{Command}{nil}
\begin{chunk}{defun doDoitButton}
(defun |doDoitButton| (htPage command)
 (declare (ignore htPage))
 (|executeInterpreterCommand| command))

\end{chunk}

The {\tt doDoitButton} function passes a valid Axiom {\tt Command}
(see Volume 13\cite{Book13} for the definition of the ``Command'' type).
This calls the Axiom command line to execute the command.

\defun{executeInterpreterCommand}{Execute a string in the interpreter}
\sig{executeInterpreterCommand}{Command}{nil}
\begin{chunk}{defun executeInterpreterCommand}
(defun |executeInterpreterCommand| (command)
  (princ command)
  (terpri)
  (|setCurrentLine| command)
  (catch 'spad_reader (|parseAndInterpret| command))
  (princ (mkprompt))
  (finish-output))

\end{chunk}

\section{Functions creating pages}
Most of the functions create a new page with a call to the function
{\tt htMakePage}. This function takes an association list which has
several possible keys.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf domainConditions} with tests such as (isDomain S (String))
constraining the domains. The possible tests are
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf isDomain}
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf text} which takes a string argument which may contain latex-like
format strings.
\begin{itemize}
\item a plain string
\item {\bf beginmenu}
\item {\bf blankline}
\item {\bf centerline}
\item {\bf em} with an argument to be emphasized
\item {\bf indent} sets the column 
\item {\bf indentrel} does a relative indent by a positive or negative amount
\item {\bf inputStrings}
\item {\bf item} occurs between a beginmenu and endmenu text 
\item {\bf lispdownlink} takes a string and a function to call
\item {\bf lisplinks}
\item {\bf menuitemstyle} takes a set of characters as an argument
\item {\bf newline}
\item {\bf space} with a numeric argument of the number of spaces
\item {\bf tab} with a numeric argument indicating the tab column
\item {\bf vspace} with the number of blank lines needed
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf bcStrings} which takes a list. The first element is the width
of the input box, the second is the default contents, the third is the
name of the variable to hold the contents, and the fourth is the domains
allowed as input (see {\bf domainConditions above}).
\item {\bf bcLinks} which takes a list containing strings and function calls.
It will link to another page by calling the page generation function for
that page.
\item {\bf doneButton} which takes 2 arguments, a label and a function to call.
\item {\bf radioButtons} takes a button name and set of lists, each one
creating a new radio button
\item {\bf inputStrings}
\item {\bf bcHt}
\end{itemize}

The {\tt htMakeDoneButton} will put a button on the page with the given
title and a function to call when pressed.

\end{tabular}
\subsection{*eof*}
The \verb|*eof*| variable is set to NIL in ncTopLevel.
\subsection{*features*}
The \verb|*features*| variable from common lisp is tested for the presence
of the \verb|:unix| keyword. Apparently this controls the use of Saturn,
a previous Axiom frontend. The Saturn frontend was never released as
open source and so this test and the associated variables are probably
not used.

\subsection{*package*}
The \verb|*package*| variable, from common lisp, is set in restart
to the BOOT package where the intepreter lives.
\subsection{*standard-input*}
The \verb|*standard-input*| common lisp variable is used to set the 
curinstream variable in ncIntLoop. 

This variable is an argument to serverReadLine in
the intloopReadConsole function.

\subsection{*standard-output*}
The \verb|*standard-output*| common lisp variable is used to set the 
curoutstream variable in ncIntLoop.

\subsection{*top-level-hook*}
The \verb|*top-level-hook*| common lisp variable contains the name of
a function to invoke when an image is started. In our case it is
called restart. This is the entry point to the Axiom interpreter.

\end{tabular}

\subsection{\$boot}
The \verb|$boot| variable is set to NIL in ncTopLevel.

\subsection{coerceFailure}
The coerceFailure symbol is a catch tag used in runspad
to catch an exit from ncTopLevel.

\subsection{\$currentLine}
The \verb|$currentLine| line is set to NIL in restart.
It is used in removeUndoLines in the undo mechanism.

\subsection{\$displayStartMsgs}
The \verb|$displayStartMsgs| variable is used in restart but is not
set so this is likely a bug.

\subsection{\$erMsgToss}
The \verb|$erMsgToss| variable is set to NIL in SpadInterpretStream.

\subsection{\$frameRecord}
\verb|$frameRecord = [delta1, delta2,... ]| where
delta(i) contains changes in the ``backwards'' direction.
Each delta(i) has the form ((var . proplist)...) where
proplist denotes an ordinary proplist. For example, an entry
of the form ((x (value) (mode (Integer)))...) indicates that
to undo 1 step, x's value is cleared and its mode should be set
to (Integer).

A delta(i) of the form (systemCommand . delta) is a special
delta indicating changes due to system commands executed between
the last command and the current command. By recording these deltas
separately, it is possible to undo to either BEFORE or AFTER
the command. These special delta(i)s are given ONLY when a
a system command is given which alters the environment.

recordFrame('system) is called before a command is executed, and
recordFrame('normal) is called after (see processInteractive1).
If no changes are found for former, no special entry is given.

This is part of the undo mechanism.

\subsection{\$intRestart}
The \verb|$intRestart| variable is used in intloop but has no value.
This is probably a bug. While the variable's value is unchanged the
system will continually reenter the SpadInterpretStream function.

\subsection{\$intTopLevel}
The \verb|$intTopLevel| is a catch tag. Throwing to this tags which is
caught in the intloop will restart the SpadInterpretStream function.

\subsection{\$IOindex}
The \verb|$IOindex| index variable is set to 1 in restart.
This variable is used in the historySpad2Cmd function in the
history mechanism. It is set in the removeUndoLines function
in the undo mechanism.

This is used in the undo mechanism in function undoCount
to compute the number of undos. You can't undo more actions then
have already happened.

\subsection{\$lastPos}
The \verb|$lastPos| variable is set in SpadInterpretStream
to the value of the \verb|$nopos| variable.
Since \verb|$nopos| appears to have no value
this is likely a bug.

\subsection{\$libQuiet}
The \verb|$libQuiet| variable is set to the third argument of the
SpadInterpretStream function. This is passed from intloop
with the value of T. This variable appears to be intended to
control the printing of library loading messages which would need
to be suppressed if input was coming from a file.

\subsection{\$msgDatabaseName}
The \verb|$msgDatabaseName| is set to NIL in reroot.

\subsection{\$ncMsgList}
The \verb|$ncMsgList| is set to NIL in SpadInterpretStream.

\subsection{\$newcompErrorCount}
The \verb|$newcompErrorCount| is set to 0 in SpadInterpretStream.

\subsection{\$nopos}
The \verb|$nopos| variable is used in SpadInterpretStream but does
not appear to have a value and is likely a bug.

\subsection{\$oldHistoryFileName}
The \verb|$oldHistoryFileName| is set at load time by a call to 
initvars to a value of ``last''. 
It is part of the history mechanism. It is used in the function
oldHistFileName and restoreHistory.

\subsection{\$okToExecuteMachineCode}
The \verb|$okToExecuteMachineCode| is set to T in SpadInterpretStream.

\subsection{\$options}
The \verb|$options| variable is tested by the history function.
If it is NIL then output the message 
\begin{verbatim}
  You have not used the correct syntax for the history command.
  Issue )help history for more information.
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|$options| variable is tested in the historySpad2Cmd function.
It appears to record the options that were given to a spad command on
the input line. The function selectOptionLC appears to take a list
off options to scan.

This variable is not yet set and is probably a bug.

\subsection{\$previousBindings}
The \verb|$previousBindings| is a copy of the 
\verb|CAAR $InteractiveFrame|. This is used to
compute the delta(i)s stored in \verb|$frameRecord|.
This is part of the undo mechanism.

\subsection{\$reportundo}
The \verb|$reportundo| variable is used in diffAlist. It was not normally
bound but has been set to T in initvars. If the variable is set
to T then we call reportUndo.

It is part of the undo mechanism.

\subsection{\$spad}
The \verb|$spad| variable is set to T in ncTopLevel.

\subsection{\$SpadServer}
If an open server is not requested then this variable to T.
It has no value before this time (and is thus a bug).

\subsection{\$SpadServerName}
The \verb|$SpadServerName| is passed to the openServer function, if the
function exists. 

\subsection{\$systemCommandFunction}
The \verb|$systemCommandFunction| is set in SpadInterpretStream
to point to the function InterpExecuteSpadSystemCommand.

\subsection{top\_level}
The top\_level symbol is a catch tag used in runspad
